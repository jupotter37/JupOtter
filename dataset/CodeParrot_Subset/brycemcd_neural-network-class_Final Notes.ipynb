Learning happens by lowering the probability of configurations that do not result in the known visible states and raise the probability of the configurations that do result in known visible states.\n",

    "Calculating the normalizing term is computationally infeasible so, instead, we use MCMC to sample the starting from random global configurations. Continue to run the Markov chain until thermal equilibrium at which point the probability of the global configuration is related to its energy by the Boltzmann distribution.\n",

    "\"Clamping\" the visibile units (using training data) and allowing the hidden units to update stochastically helps the model learn the states of the best configuration of hidden units to explain the observed data.\n",

    "Learning in network architecture involves maximizing the product of the probabilities that the machine assigns the binary vectors in the training set. It's equivalent to maximizing the probability that we could produce the N training cases (binary vectors) if we let the network settle to its equilibrated distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "A directed acyclic graph composed of binary stocastic neurons. Like an RBM it's a generative model where learning is focused on generating configuration that produces inputs. Unlike RBM, it's not energy based, it's causal.\n",
