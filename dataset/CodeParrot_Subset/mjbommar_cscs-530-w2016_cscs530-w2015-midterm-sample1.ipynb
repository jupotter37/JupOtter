    "# Midterm \n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "I will explore whether a network-theory driven approach shown to improve the efficiency of an agricultural extension program is sensitive to the models and parameters originally used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Social networks have been shown to be important vehicles for the transmission of new agricultural methods or 'technologies' (Bandiera and Rasul 2006, Conley and Udry 2010).  These types of dynamics and time-varying agent behavior are best captured with through network modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project is based off a recent paper which used network modeling in conjunction with a large-scale field experiment (Beaman et al 2014).  I wish to test the robustness of the findings of their model and so will employ a similar network modeling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background on base paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Beaman and co-authors aimed to improve the rollout of an agricultural extension program using predictions from network theory to optimally select 'seed farmers'.  'Seed farmers' are the select farmers in a village that the agricultural extension program trains.  Because it is costly to train farmers in this way, it is most efficient to pick seed farmers such that their adoption of the agricultural technology will lead to the greatest spread of the technology throughout the village.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Beaman and coauthors first elicit the social networks of various rural villages.  Then under the condition that the extension program only trains two farmers in each village, they take every possible combination of two nodes in a village network and simulate an information diffusion process for 4 periods.  They take a measure of information diffusion at the end of each simulation and the pair of nodes which gives the greatest diffusion is their optimal seeding pair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Their findings are then used in a field experiment where a random half of total villages are seeded according to their simulated optimal seeds while the other half is seeded according to the extension program's default procedure, usually based off of a field officer's own knowledge of the village and its influential farmers.  They find evidence that network-theory informed seeding leads to increased technological adoption over baseline seeding procedures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### My extensions and measures of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish to recreate and expand upon their simulations in the following ways:\n",
    "- I will compare optimal seeds found with their method against optimal seeds found with an extended process of information diffusion.  The extended process will include the possibility that households can reject a new technology even after being exposed to it by multiple connections.  The original process assumes that a household will automatically adopt a technology after the number of connections who have adopted the technology passes a certain threshold\n",
    "- I will also sweep across the number of periods simulated and the alpha which the adoption threshold is normally distributed around to see if this produces alternate optimal seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The original paper looks at rural village in Malawi.  I do not have access to their network data but I have a dataset of social graphs from 74 villages in South India.  Though there may be differences in network structure between villages in these two locations, I will assume they are reasonably comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I will recreate results from Beaman et al by selecting all combinations of node pairs in a subset of 25 villages.  For each pair, I will run them through a information diffusion simulation for {3,4,5,6} steps.  I will also sweep through values {1,2,3} for a alpha parameter.  Each household has an adoption threshold, T, which determines whether they adopt the new technology or not.  If X number of connections have adopted the technology and X=>T, then the household will adopt the new technology in the next period.  Each household independently drawns a threshold from a normal distribution N(alpha, 0.5) bounded positive, so sweeping through alpha parameters will push up and down the distribution of household thresholds T.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate stochasticity, I will repeat 2000 times, and take an average measure of information diffusion (given by percent of households adopted at last step).  The pair of nodes which give the greatest information difussion are my theory-driven seed farmers equivalent to those found in Beaman et al.  I will examine whether the determination of these optimal seed farmers depends on the number of steps run and the alpha parameter used.  Then, I will run the same simulations except using the extended information diffusion process described above.  I want to see whether seed farmers selected through this method are different than those selected by Beaman's process.  For the midterm, I will concentrate on coding the re-creation of method from Beaman et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### I. Space\n",
    "I will model space with an undirected social network.  Each node represents a rural household and each edge represents a social connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### II. Actors\n",
    "Each node in my network is a household.  They are modeled simply and have only a few properties:\n",
    "- id: household id\n",
    "- adopted: whether they have adopted the new technology or not\n",
    "- threshold: the threshold above which they will adopt the new technology in the next period.  This threshold will be drawn from a normal distribution with mean alpha and standard deviation 0.5 which is bounded to be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step, each unadopted household will count the number of connections who have adopted the new technology.  If this count exceeds a household's adoption threshold, it will also adopt the technology in the next period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. Model Wrapper\n",
    "I will wrap my model in a function which loops through each village, and in each village, loops through every possible pair of nodes.  Then, I will sweep through my parameters, number of steps and alpha.  I will repeat this under the alternate information diffusion process.  I will also determine and collect optimal seeds here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV. Initial Conditions\n",
    "Each model will start with a list of adopted households.  In the first step, only seed households will be in this list which will be read in through the wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### V. Model Parameters\n",
    "My model will have the following parameters:\n",
    "- network: adjacency matrix that is read in from wrapper\n",
    "- alpha: parameter determining distribution of adoption threshold\n",
    "- HH_adopted: list of adopted households, in first step these are seed households given by wrapper\n",
    "- HH_not_adopted: list of all not adopted households\n",
