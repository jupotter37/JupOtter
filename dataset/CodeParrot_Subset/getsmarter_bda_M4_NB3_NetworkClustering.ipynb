The idea behind it is to identify groups of people that share a common interest, based on the assumption that these people tend to link to each other more than to the rest of the network.

In the function definition (above), you have been provided with a utility function, \"``get_cluster_membership()``\", which does the latter.\n",

In agglomerative clustering, as used in the example above, you can get zero error for the objective function by considering each data point as its own cluster. Hence, the selection of $k$ invariably involves a trade-off maximum compression of the data (using a single cluster), and maximum accuracy by assigning each data point to its own cluster.

To select the cluster size, look for a large shift in the distance metric. In our example with dendrograms plots shown above, say a case has been made for an ideal cutoff of 3.5. The number of clusters is then simply the number of intersections of a horizontal line (with height of 3.5) with the vertical lines of the dendrogram.
