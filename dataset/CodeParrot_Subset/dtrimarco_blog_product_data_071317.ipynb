    "# Pandas for Product Analysis Part 1: Apply and Transform\n",
    " \n",
    "Python's [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) package is one of the most powerful tools for data analysis in the Python ecosystem. Built on top of NumPy, it makes working with tabular data quite effective and adds an astounding amount of functionality to your toolkit. Despite its strengths, there are some very useful functions that are challenging to grasp based on the pandas docs. `apply` and `transform` are two such examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "One quick note before we dive in: this series assumes basic working knowledge of pandas. There are several resources like [Dataquest](https://dataquest.io), [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and pandas cheat sheets to get you up to speed if this is hard to follow."

    "\n",
    "In short, these two functions are used to operate on data structures, similarly to Python's built in `map` function. We will get into the differences, but typically they are used in combination with `groupby` to perform aggregate functions on various groups of a dataset. This a direct analogy to `GROUP BY` in SQL and I am going to assume familiarity with how it works (if you aren't, [here is a decent intro](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html#splitting-an-object-into-groups)). The major difference is that we can leverage the flexibility of Python and pandas DataFrames to do basically whatever we want."
