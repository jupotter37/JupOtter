    "- **frwiki-2013.ids** contains the article titles (one per line, $ n $ lines in total). By convention, each article is associated to its line number (from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $).\n",
    "- **frwiki-2013.adja** contains the adjacency list of the graph: line $ i $ (from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $) contains, in plain ASCII, the numbers of the articles that are linked by $ i $. \n",
    "- **frwiki-2013-t.adja** contains the adjacency list of the transposed graph: line $ i $ (from $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $) contains the numbers of the articles that have a link to $ i $.\n",

Feel free to use the dataset(s) you want, but starting with French is recommended (a PageRank computation can take a few minutes on a slow machine).\n",
