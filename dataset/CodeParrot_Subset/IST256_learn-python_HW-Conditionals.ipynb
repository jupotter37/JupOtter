    "\n",
    "Professor Charles Xavier has asked us to write a program to automatically calculate a final letter grade and grade points on a 4.0 scale forhis course based on an input point range. Here is the grading scale he uses: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Point Range Grade Grade Points\n",
    "    125-150     A     4.0\n",
    "    100-124     B     3.0\n",
    "    75-99       C     2.0\n",
    "    50-74       D     1.0\n",
    "    0-49        F     0.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "  \n",
    "Write a Python program to input a number of points earned and then outputs the letter grade and grade points.\n",

    "    Professor Xavier's Grade Calculator\n",
    "    Input the total points earned 0 to 150: 105\n",
    "    Grade: B Grade Points: 3.0\n",
    "    \n",
    "NOTES:\n",
    "\n",
    "- your code should perform bounds checking of the input.  Valid inputs are in the range 0 to 150.\n",
    "- your code should handle non-integer input.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the **problem simplification** approach as learned in small group and the lab. Solve a simpler problem first, such as calculating and printing just an \"A\" grade, get that working and then add more grades features as you go. \n",
    "- The last things you should accomplish are bounds checking and handling bad input.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
