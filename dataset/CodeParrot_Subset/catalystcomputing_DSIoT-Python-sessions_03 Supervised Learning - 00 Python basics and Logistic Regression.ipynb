Many interesting variables are dichotomous: for example, consumers make a decision to buy or not buy, a product may pass or fail quality control, there are good or poor credit risks, an employee may be promoted or not. A range of regression techniques have been developed for analysing data with categorical dependent variables, including logistic regression and discriminant analysis. \n",
