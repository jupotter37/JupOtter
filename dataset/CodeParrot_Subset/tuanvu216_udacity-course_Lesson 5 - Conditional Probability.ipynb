I would argue becoming a professor in Standford is generally not very likely, so probability might be 0.001 but it also depends on whether you're born smart or dumb.

Then we added a second row of the truth table, where our unobserved disease variable took the opposite value of not diseased.\n",
    "- Written this way, it looks really clumsy, but that's effectively what we did when we went to the truth table. So we now understand that certain coin flips are dependent on other coin flips, so if god, for example, flips the coin of us having a disease or not, then the medical test again has a random outcome, but its probability really depends on whether we have the disease or not. We have to consider this when we do probabilistic inference. In the next unit, we're going to ask the real question. Say we really care about whether we have a disease like cancer or not. What do you think the probability is, given that our doctor just gave us a positive test result?\n",
