    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.\n",

    "### Python’s Benevolent Dictator For Life!\n",
    "\n",
    "    “Python is an experiment in how  much freedom program-mers need.  Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressive-ness is endangered.”\n",
    "                                           - Guido van Rossum \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple and easy to use and very efficient\n",
    "  - What you can do in a 100 lines of python could take you a 1000 in C++ … this is the reason many startups (e.g., Instagram) use python and keep using it\n",
    "\n",
    "- 90% of robotics uses either C++ or python\n",
    "  - Although C++ is faster in run-time, development (write, compile, link, etc) is much slower due to complex syntax, memory management, pointers (they can be fun!) and difficulty in debugging any sort of real program\n",
    " - Java is dying (or dead)\n",
    " - Microsoft is still struggling to get people outside of the Windows OS to embrace C#\n",
    " - Apple's swift is too new and constantly making major changes ... maybe some day\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who Uses It?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Industrial Light & Magic (Stars Wars people): used in post production scripting to tie together outputs from other C++ programs\n",
    "- Eve-Online (big MMORGP game): used for both client and server aspects of the game\n",
    "- Instagram, Spotify, SurveyMonkey, The Onion, Bitbucket, Pinterest, and more use Django (python website template framework) to create/serve millions of users\n",
    "- Dropbox, Paypal, Walmart and Google (YouTube)\n",
    "  - Note: Guido van Rossum worked for Google and now works for Dropbox\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Programs on UNIX (or your robot)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Call python program via the python interpreter: `python my_program.py`\n",
    "  - This is kind of the stupid way\n",
    "- Make a python file directly executable \n",
    "  - Add a shebang (it’s a Unix thing) to the top of your program: `#!/usr/bin/env python`\n",
    "  - Make the file executable: `chmod a+x my_program.py`\n",
    "  - Invoke file from Unix command line: `./my_program.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enough to Understand Code (Short Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indentation matters for functions, loops, classes, etc\n",
    "- First assignment to a variable creates it\n",
    "- Variable types (int, float, etc) don’t need to be declared. \n",
    "- Assignment is = and comparison is ==\n",
    "- For numbers + - * % are as expected\n",
    "    - modulas (%) returns the remainder: 5%3 => 2\n",
    "- Logical operators are words (and, or, not) not symbols\n",
    "- We are using `__future__` for python 2 / 3 compatibility\n",
    "  - The basic printing command is print(‘hello’)\n",
    "  - Division works like expected:\n",
    "    - Float division: 5/2 = 2.5\n",
    "    - Integer division: 5//2 = 2\n",
    "- Start comments with #, rest of line is ignored\n",
    "- Can include a “documentation string” as the first line of a new function or class you define\n",

    "Again, to have Python 3 compatability and help you in the future, we are going to print things using the print function. Python 2 by default uses a print statement. Also, it is good form to use the newer `format()` function on strings rather than the old C style `%s` for a string or `%d` for an integer. There are lots of cool things you can do with `format()` but we won't dive too far into it ... just the basics.\n",
