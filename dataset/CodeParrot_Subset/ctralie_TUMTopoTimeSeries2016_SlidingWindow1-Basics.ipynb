    "It seems reasonable to ask what the ideal dimension to embed into is. While that question may be answerable, it would be better to bypass the question altogether. Similarly, it seems that beyond detecting the largest period, these tools are limited in detecting the secondary ones. Topological tools that we will see beginning in the next lab will allow us to make some progress toward that goal."

By contrast, the power spectral density functions are very close between the two, as shown below.  Hence, it appears that geometric tools are more appropriate for telling the difference between these two types of signals"
