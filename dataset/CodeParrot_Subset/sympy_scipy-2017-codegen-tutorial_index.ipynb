    "This tutorial will introduce code generation concepts using the [SymPy](http://sympy.org) library. SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. Code generation refers to the act of converting a SymPy symbolic expression into equivalent code in some language, typically for numeric evaluation. This allows one to use SymPy to symbolically model a problem and generate fast numerical code for specific platforms that executes that model. This is a powerful tool that is useful to scientists in many domains. Code generation allows users to speed up existing code, to deal only with the high level mathematics of a problem, avoids mathematical errors and typos, makes it possible to deal with expressions that would otherwise be too large to write by hand, and opens possibilities to perform automatic mathematical optimizations of expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "SymPy supports generating code for C, C++, Fortran, MATLAB/Octave, Python, Cython, Julia, JavaScript, LLVM, Rust, Haskell, Mathematica, Tensorflow, and Theano, and can easily be extended to other languages. SymPy’s code generation is used by libraries such as PyDy, pyodesys, sympybotics, pycalphad, and many other programs.\n",
