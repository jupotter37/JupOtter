If the data is not true, that doesn't means that we prove the Defendant is innocent, it just means that the evidence is not enough to reject the null hypothesis.We're still doing it from the start under the assumption that Null Hypothesis is true. On the countrary if the data can reject the null hypothesis, then we *succeed* to prove Alternative Hypothesis. So there's two cases, first there's *not enough data* to reject the Null Hypothesis, or reject the Null Hypothesis. "
