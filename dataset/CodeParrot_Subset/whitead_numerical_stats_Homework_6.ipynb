At THE DEAD HEDGEHOG, there will be 5 timeslots and your probability of reading will be 0.5. At THE DANCING CLOUD, there are 7 timeslots and your probability of reading will be 0.7. Plot each of the distributions representing number of poems read for the different poetry readings. You should plot three distributions."
