    "# Notebook introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection is expensive and time consuming, as Arek Stopczynski alluded to in this module's video content.\n",
    "In some cases, you will be lucky enough to have existing datasets available to support your analysis. You may have datasets from previous analyses, access to data providers, or curated datasets from your organization. In many cases, however, you will not have access to the data that you require to support your analysis, and you will have to find alternate mechanisms. \n",
    "The data quality requirements will differ based on the problem you are trying to solve. Taking the hypothetical case of geocoding a location, which was introduced in Module 1, the accuracy of the geocoded location does not need to be exact when you are simply trying to plot the locations of students on a map. Geocoding a location for an automated vehicle to turn off the highway, on the other hand, has an entirely different accuracy requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Those of you who work in large organizations may be privileged enough to have company data governance and data quality initiatives. These efforts and teams can often add significant value both in terms of supplying company-standard curated data, and making you aware of the internal policies that need to be adhered to.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst or data scientist, it is important to be aware of the implications of your decisions. You need to choose the appropriate set of tools and methods to deal with sourcing and supplying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology has matured in recent years, and allowed access to a host of sources of data that can be used in your analyses. In many cases you can access free resources, or obtain (at a cost) data that has been curated, is at a lower latency, or comes with a service-level agreement. Some governments have even made datasets publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been introduced to [OpenPDS](http://openpds.media.mit.edu/), in the video content, where the focus shifts from supplying raw data -- where the provider needs to apply security principles before sharing datasets -- to supplying answers rather than data. OpenPDS allows users to collect, store, and control access to their data, while also allowing them to protect their privacy. In this way, users still have ownership of their data, as defined by the new deal on data. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates another example of how to source external data to enrich your analyses. The Python ecosystem contains a rich set of tools and libraries that can help you to exploit the available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will not go into detail regarding the various options to source and interact with social data from sources such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google Plus. However, you should be able to find libraries that will assist you in sourcing and manipulating these sources of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter data is a good example because, depending on the options selected by the Twitter user, every tweet contains not just the message or content that most users are aware of. It also contains a view of the network of the person, home location, location from which the message was sent, and a number of other features that can be very useful when studying networks around a topic of interest. Professor Alex Pentland pointed out the difference in what you share with the world (how you want to be seen) compared to what you actually do and believe (what you commit to).  Be sure to keep these concepts in mind when you start exploring the additional sources of data. Those who are interested in the topic can start to explore the options by visiting the [Twitter library on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter). \n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the **five Rs** introduced in Module 1, and consider the following questions:\n",
    "- How accurate does my dataset need to be?\n",
    "- How often should the dataset be updated?\n",
    "- What happens if the data provider is no longer available?\n",
    "- Do I need to adhere to any organizational standards to ensure consistent reporting or integration with other applications?\n",
    "- Are there any implications to getting the values wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to start with “untrusted” data sources as a means of validating that your analysis can be executed. Once this is done, you can replace the untrusted components with trusted and curated datasets, as your analysis matures."
