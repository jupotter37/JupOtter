    "\n",
    "There are currently three main modes of operations of the Echo package, distinguished mainly by their inputs:\n",
    "- **TX-TL Setup Spreadsheet**: Takes a pair of CSV spreadsheets saved from a TX-TL setup spreadsheet (version 2.X). Use this for most TX-TL experiments. \n",
    "- **Programmatic Setup**: You can build a TX-TL reaction (or, with a bit more difficulty, a non-TX-TL reaction) programmatically, without using a setup spreadsheet. There are a couple of functions for doing this, which can be combined:\n",
    "    - **build_dilution_series**: Takes two materials and an array of concentrations for each, and builds a 2D dilution series out of the two. Can also be used to set up 1D dilution series (by setting one of the materials to a dummy material and giving it the concentration list [0]). \n",
    "    - **add_material_to_block**: Adds a single ingredient to all wells in a rectangular block on the destination plate, at a fixed concentration.\n",
    "    - **add_material_to_well**: Like add_material_to_block, but to a single well.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Association Spreadsheet**: Takes one or more spreadsheets describing the contents of an Echo source plate, plus a simple spreadsheet describing final concentrations of the materials of those source plates in each destination. Use this for non-TX-TL experiments, or if you have a TX-TL experiment with more source materials than can be handled in a TX-TL setup spreadsheet."

    "*A word of warning*: The quick start examples will help you jump right into setting up an experiment, but they make a number of assumptions about your experiment. Some things you'll want to check before running your own:\n",

    "- **Destination Plate Type**: Default is \"Nunc_384_black_glassbottom\".\n",
    "- **Destination Plate Size**: The Echo package has no knowledge of the destination plate. *There is no check to keep you from defining picks off the edge of the destination plate*.\n",
    "- **Controls**: TX-TL experiments come with a negative control. Most TX-TL setup spreadsheets also define a positive control.\n",

    "Every project begins with an EchoRun object. This object holds (nearly) all of the information about an experiment, and is ultimately responsible for coordinating plates and materials, and for actually writing picklists and experimental protocols. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most EchoRun objects need a SourcePlate object. This object is responsible for keeping track of which wells have been used, and for assigning new wells on the source plate to materials that you'll want to transfer. It will try to assign wells in a way that keeps the same material in a contiguous block, buffered on either side by an empty well for ease of pipetting. SourcePlate objects are also typically associated with a .dat tracking file that lists which wells have been used on the plate. That way, you can use the same source plate over many experiments without having to manually program in which wells are forbidden. The SourcePlate object will read this file to learn what it has available to it, and will automatically write back to the same file whenever the EchoRun object controlling it writes a picklist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Materials (DNA, chemicals, water, TX-TL, etc) on a source plate are represented by EchoSourceMaterial objects. An EchoSourceMaterial has a concentration, which is always stored in nM. However, because dsDNA is usually measured in ng/uL, and dsDNA is one of the most common materials used, EchoSourceMaterials by default assume that the concentration set in their constructors is in units of ng/uL. Any EchoSourceMaterial with `length` > 0 will convert that ng/uL concentration into an internal nM concentration. Only if the length of the EchoSourceMaterial is set to 0 will it use its set concentration value directly. This convention appears in several other contexts in the echo package.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EchoSourceMaterial is always associated with a SourcePlate. The EchoSourceMaterial keeps track of how much of itself has been used, and will request that wells be allocated on the SourcePlate. \n",
    "\n",
    "EchoRun objects can also have a MasterMix object, which defines what materials will be put into the master mix, and at what concentrations. Association lists don't currently support master mixes, and TX-TL reactions built from CSVs will always pull their master mix information from the CSV, so this is currently only useful if you're using the dilution series function(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an Echo picklist, you will generally need to do three things:\n",
    "- Building an EchoRun object. This usually just means setting the name of a source plate tracking file\n",
    "- Describe the experiment. This almost always means one or more calls to `build_picklist_from_txtl_setup_csvs`, `build_dilution_series`, or `build_picklist_from_association_spreadsheet` from your EchoRun object. What this entails depends on your experiment; TX-TL setup with a setup spreadsheet and association file setups are almost completely defined by external files, while 2D dilution series experiments require some definition in your script. \n",

You must always set up a source plate first. This should be done by calling `load_source_plate` with the name of the source plate spreadsheet and information about its organization. Alternatively, you could build your own manually. That is not recommended. \n",

You can add any number of additional columns to the source plate spreadsheet, which will be ignored by this function. This is the spreadsheet read in with the `load_source_plate` command.\n",
    "* Location: This is the well number of the material, i.e. \"C4\" or \"E08\". If the same material is found in multiple wells, it will need one row for each well.\n",

It can be any string, but be aware that the names \"water\" and \"txtl_mm\" are reserved for describing water and TX-TL master mix, respectively. For this function, that won't matter, but if you try to combine other setup commands with this one, you should avoid using \"water\" and \"txtl_mm\" as material names. \n",
    "* Concentration: If the material is dsDNA, this should be the concentration of the DNA in ng/µL. Otherwise, it should be the concentration of the material in whatever units you want (nM recommended).\n",

    "* Plate: A single source plate spreadsheet can contain materials from different source plates, so a column is required to determine which plate the material is coming from. Name of the source plate. Put a number N here, and the plate will be auto-named \"Plate[N]\" (recommended usage). Alternatively, you can give the plate a custom name.\n",

One column of the association spreadsheet determines that row's well on the destination plate. The EchoRun object will scan through every column, ignoring the well column, taking pairs of columns from left to right. There can be any number of pairs of columns; each one will cause one material to be moved from the source plate to the destination plate. The first clumn in each pair holds the name of a material. This name must exactly match one of the material names listed in the source spreadsheet, and determines where material will be taken from. The second column in each pair describes the *final* concentration of that material. If the material is dsDNA (has non-zero length), the units of final concentration are assumed to be nM. Otherwise, the units of final concentration are the same as the units of concentration used for that material in the source plate.\n",
