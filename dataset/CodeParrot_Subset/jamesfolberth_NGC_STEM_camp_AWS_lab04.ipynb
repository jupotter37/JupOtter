    "\n",
    "A function definition has a few parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `def`\n",
    "It always starts with `def` (short for **def**ine):\n",

    "    def\n",

    "Next comes the name of the function.  Let's call our function `to_percentage`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def to_percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Signature\n",
    "Next comes something called the *signature* of the function.  This tells Python how many arguments your function should have, and what names you'll use to refer to those arguments in the function's code.  `to_percentage` should take one argument, and we'll call that argument `proportion` since it should be a proportion.\n",

    "Functions can do complicated things, so you should write an explanation of what your function does.  For small functions, this is less important, but it's a good habit to learn from the start.  Conventionally, Python functions are documented by writing a triple-quoted string:\n",

    "##### Body\n",
