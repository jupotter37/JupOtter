    "The first issue that I has was that I was trying to output a single scalar whose value could be thresholded to determine whether the network should return TRUE or FALSE. It turns out loss functions for this are much more complicated than if I had instead treated the XOR problem as a classification task with one output per possible label ('TRUE', 'FALSE'). This is the approach I have implemented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue I encountered at first was that I was using too few hidden nodes. I originally thought that such a simple problem would only need a couple nodes in a single hidden layer to implement. However, such small networks were extremely slow to converge. This is exemplified in the Architectures section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, when I was using small batch sizes (<= 5 examples), and randomly populating the batches, the network would sometimes fail to converge, probably because the batches didn't contain all the possible examples. "
