    "##Abstract\n",
    "This paper describes describes the process of downloading, analyzing and cleaning of an OpenStreet Map data set of my former home town as a student: [Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden), a state capital in eastern Germany, [a baroque town beautifully located on the board of the river Elbe](https://www.google.de/search?q=dresden&newwindow=1&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAkQ_AUoA2oVChMIrc3d_cT3xwIVh2fbCh3Y6QYu&biw=1920&bih=969) and town home to a high-tech conglomerate from the micro-electronics sector called [Silicon Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Saxony).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, first, the pipeline (and python script) to perform retrieval, analysis and cleaning of the data is introduced (chapters [Approach](#Approach)) and results of the analysis stage are presented (chapter [Overview of the Data](#Overview-of-the-Data)). During the analysis, interesting facts of Dresden are uncovered, like the most popular religion, sport, beer, cuisine or leisure activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the cleaning stage (chapter [Problems Encountered in the Map](#Problems-Encountered-in-the-Map-/-Data-Quality)), canonicalizing phone numbers present in the data set and unifying cuisine classifications where the challenge of choice. Some other cleaning techniques like cleaning street names and post codes where tried, but proved not fruitful. The paper is finally concluded with some further ideas for data set cleaning (chapter [Other Ideas about the Data Set](#Other-Ideas-about-the-Data-Set))."

    "##The Approach\n",
    "I implemented retrieving / storing / analysing and cleaning in a python script. The script can be used like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# python project.py\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "  python project.py -d    Download & unpack bz2 file to OSM file (experimental)\n",
    "  python project.py -p    Process OSM file and write JSON file\n",
    "  python project.py -w    Write JSON file to MongoDB\n",
    "  python project.py -z    Download and install the zipcode helpers\"\n",
    "  python project.py -f    Audit format / structure of data\n",
    "  python project.py -s    Audit statistics of data\n",
    "  python project.py -q    Audit quality of data\n",
    "  python project.py -Z    Audit quality of data: Zipcodes - (see -z option)\n",
    "  python project.py -c    Clean data in MongoDB\n",
    "  python project.py -C    Clean data debug mode - don't actually write to DB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Different options can be combined, so ``` python project.py -dpwfsqc ``` will do the whole round trip. During the process, I re-used most of the code and data format developed during the \"Data Wrangling With MongoDB\" Udacity course. For example, the data format used for storing the data (```-p``` and ```-w``` option) is completely based on [Lesson 6](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud032/l-768058569)  - with some fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some output of the script is shown on the terminal, some is written to local files. If a file is written, this is indicated in the terminal output. A sample of the script's terminal output is included in the ```output_*.txt``` files included in the submission."

    "### Data Format\n",
    "**Try it out:** Use ```python project.py -f``` to obtain the data for this chapter. This is a long-running process which might take a few hours to complete! There is an output file written to [```Project/data/audit_format_map.csv```](Project/data/audit_format_map.csv) which can be beautified into an [Excel spreadsheet](Project/data/audit_format_map.xlsx).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A picture of the excel spreadsheet audit_format.xlsx](audit_format.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data format was audited, which consisted of going through all the documents and aggregating the occurence of any attributes and the prevalence of their types (```str```ing, ```int```eger, ```float``` and ```other```). For this, batches of 1000 documents each are retrieved from the collection and each combed through by the python code while a Python Dataframe keeps track of the counters. Since there are 1,360,000 elements, this process takes many hours; an alternative would be to run the query natively in JavaScript code on the MongoDB shell or to issue the command as a BSON command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overview of the format showed no obvious big problems with the data at first glance but provided some valuable insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One area of improvement could be the phone number, which is scattered across multiple data fields (```address:phone```, ```phone``` and ```phone_mobile```) and was identified as a potential candidate for cleaning (see [Auditing Phone Numbers](#Auditing-Phone-Numbers) and [Cleaning Phone Numbers](#Cleaning-Phone-Numbers)).\n",
    "* Some values are present in the dataset as sometimes ```str```ing, othertimes numeric: The XML parsing process takes care that each value is, whenever parsable, stored as integer or float. For attributes like street numbers, mixed occurences may be in the data set.\n",
    "* This automatic parsing of ```int``` or ```float``` turned out to be not always useful: a problem are leading zeros which in certain cases hold semantics. For german phone numbers, a leading zero signifies the start of an area code (```0```) or the start of a country code (```00```). For german postcodes, a leading zero in a postcode represents the german state of Saxony. As an outcome of this insight, I changed the parsing routine of the XML data to only parse values as numeric, if they do not contain a leading zero (```not s.startswith(\"0\")```)\n",
    "* I checked some of the lesser-common values for sanity. E.g., there is a parameter ```dogshit``` which appears three times. As it turns out, this is not a prank of some map editors, who document dog feces they find in the area, but an indication about whether a public trash can contains a dispenser of plastic bags for relevant situations."

It is assumed that then, they would most likely end in an abbreviation like ```str.```. For this we use a regular expression querying all streets <u>not</u> ending with a particular suffix like ```[Ss]traße``` (street), ```[Ww]eg``` (way) etc. This is accomplished by a chain of [\"negative lookbehind\"](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) expressions (```(?<!...)```) which must all in sequence evaluate to \"true\" in order to flag a street name as non-conforming."

    "* If the value of the OSM element does not match any name of the Geonames.org data, the element could be flagged for manual processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost**: Relatively easily implementable, however, out of scope for this project. We should, however, strive for implementing the related query in native BSON code in order to not hit the database with every zipcode-to-Geonames-element mapping request for each OSM element.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit**: Potentially high, depending on how many cities are not entered at all (quick win) or entered correctly (some additional manual work required).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cuisine Taxonomy\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxonomy of cuisines could be further formalized to contain super- and subsets of cuisines (e.g. each \"italian\" cuisine is also an \"international\" cuisine). With domain knowledge, coarsly classified restaurants could potentially also be sub-classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost**: High, The creation of a proper cuisine-taxonomy would require substantial knowledge of the subject matter of cuisines and the subtle differences in culinary art. Also, rather than a tree-based classification, some \"fusion\" kitchens might overlap:  any simplification or unification we carry out here comes at the cost of sacrificing detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit**: Medium-high in certain use cases, higher number of restaurants with a certain classification lets us better find the restaurant of our taste and compare various restaurants with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Open Questions\n",
    "Overall, the data set of Dresden is pretty neat and tidy. Compared to other, huger cities (e.g., in India) I might have had an easier job. Further open questions or ideas (out of scope for this report) include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The users might be analyzed further: Why are so many nodes (many thousands) created by so few users? Are bots at work? Why are so many users only contributing with very few edits? (Maybe gamification - leaderboards for who has the most edits during the recent week - would provide help.)\n",
    "* One could audit for completeness by parsing several sample websites for addresses and trying to retrieve those addresses in the Open Street Map data.\n",
    "* One could feed the normalized phone data back into Open Street Map by either using a Web Service or using the XML format."
