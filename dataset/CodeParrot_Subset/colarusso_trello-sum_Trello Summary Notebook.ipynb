    "# Trello Summary Notebook (Work In Progress)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook scans a user's Trello boards to create a summary of recent and upcoming work. It pulls out lists with specific names and places their boards in a summary document. I cut-and-paste the content of these documents into my weekly [snippets](http://blog.idonethis.com/google-snippets-internal-tool/) and to and from requierments documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you place an estimate of the time needed to complete a task in brackets preceeding the title of your cards, it will also calculate how much work *you* have in all lists named *Doing*, *Writing*, *Dev*, *QC*, *UAT*, or *Rollout* (more on these lists below). It compares this sum against the available hours in your work week. Consequently, the assumption is that you're running this once a week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it creates a time tracking document with the titles of cards from all of your items in the above listed lists. This document has timers for each task and works as a punch clock, noting when you are working and what you are working on. A timer is only provided for cards where you are a member. Other cards show up in a small orange font. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: your time estimates are not included in your summary document. Rather percentages are used to give a sense of priorities. I feel that the content of your time tracking document should be for personal use only. This is about giving you tools to improve your efficency, not enableing some Orwellian tracking system.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up a Trello borad for each of your projects, and create boards with one of the following list sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "### To Do Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queuing.** Things you want to get to someday.\n",
    "- **On Deck.** Things you want to get to once *Doing* has room.\n",
    "- **Doing.** Things you plan to do in the upcoming week.\n",
    "- **Done.** Things you have done. \n",
    "\n",
    "OR: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Product Development (Features)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queuing.** Sketches of features & ideas you want to get to someday.\n",
    "- **Writing.** Cards you need to flesh out before moving to the Backlog.\n",
    "- **Backlog.** Features you want to get to once there is time.\n",
    "- **Dev.** Features currently in development.\n",
    "- **QC.** Features in need of internal testing in preperation for user testing.\n",
    "- **UAT.** Features that have been ported to the UAT enviornment for user acceptace testing, \n",
    "- **Rollout.** Features to be added to the production enviornment. \n",
    "- **Done.** Features in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "Define bite-sized tasks/features for your projects and add these as cards to the appropriate lists, prefacing each task with an estimate in hours of how long you think it will take (e.g., '`[1] task A`' would indicate that you estimate task A will take 1 hour). \n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: Set up [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) recipes to add recurring tasks to your boards. For example, every week late Sunday night, IFTTT adds cards to my *Queuing* board for my weekly meetings. This way, when I move one week's cards, along with their notes to *Done*, I have a new set to move into *Doing*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a week, review and edit your boards and edit them as needed. Then run the code found under ***Run Me*** to produce a summary and time-traking document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Time Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've already set things up, skip to *Run Me* below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependancies\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to install the [py-trello libary](http://py-trello.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). So run the following on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install py-trello`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Login to your [Trello account](https://trello.com/) and vist [this page](https://trello.com/app-key) to get your app credentials (i.e., your *key* and your *secret*). When you run the cell below, you will be prompted to provide these. Now run the following code:"
