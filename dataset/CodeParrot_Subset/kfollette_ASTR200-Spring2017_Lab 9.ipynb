Because score is numerical ***and*** discrete, all of the statistics above are informative.

    "*QuaRCS score can take discrete integer values between 0 and 25. The minimum score for this dataset is 1 and the maximum is 25. There are 2,777 valid entries for score in this QuaRCS dataset, for which the mean is 13.9 and the median is 14 (both 56\\% of the maximum score). These are very close together, suggesting a reasonably centrally-concentrated score distrubution, and the low skewness value of 0.1 supports this. The kurtosis of the distribution is negative (platykurtic), which tells us that the distribution of scores is flat rather than peaky.   The most common score (\"mode\") is 10, with 197 (~7%) of participants getting this score, however all score values from 7-21 have counts of greater than 100, supporting the flat nature of the distribution suggested by the negative kurtosis. The interquartile range (25-75 percentiles) is 8 points, and the standard deviation is 5.3.
