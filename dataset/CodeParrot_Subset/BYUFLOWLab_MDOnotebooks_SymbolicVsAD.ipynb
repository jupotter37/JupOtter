    "For a simple expression like this, symbolic differentiation is long but actually works reasonbly well, and both will give a numerically exact answer.  But if we change the loop to 100 (go ahead and try this) or add other complications, the symbolic solver will fail.  However, automatic differentiation will continue to work without issue (see the simple source code transformation version).  Furthermore, if we add other dimensions to the problem, symbolic differentiation quickly becomes costly as lots of computations get repeated, whereas automatic differentiation is able to reuse a lot of calculations."
