    "#### How It Works\n",
    "This is a long example but helps demonstrate the nature of class and object variables. Here, population belongs to the Robot class and hence is a class variable. The name variable belongs to the object (it is assigned using self) and hence is an object variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we refer to the population class variable as Robot.population and not as self.population. We refer to the object variable name using self.name notation in the methods of that object. Remember this simple difference between class and object variables. Also note that an object variable with the same name as a class variable will hide the class variable!   \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of Robot.population, we could have also used self.__class__.population because every object refers to its class via the self.__class__ attribute.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The how_many is actually a method that belongs to the class and not to the object. This means we can define it as either a classmethod or a staticmethod depending on whether we need to know which class we are part of. Since we refer to a class variable, let's use classmethod.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have marked the how_many method as a class method using a decorator.\n",
    "Decorators can be imagined to be a shortcut to calling a wrapper function, so applying the @classmethod decorator is same as calling:\n",
    "how_many = classmethod(how_many)\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the __init__ method is used to initialize the Robot instance with a name. In this method, we increase the population count by 1 since we have one more robot being added. Also observe that the values of self.name is specific to each object which indicates the nature of object variables.\n",
    "Remember, that you must refer to the variables and methods of the same object using the self only. This is called an attribute reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "All class members are public. One exception: If you use data members with names using the double underscore prefix such as ***__privatevar*** , Python uses name-mangling to effectively make it a private variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the convention followed is that any variable that is to be used only within the class or object should begin with an underscore and all other names are public and can be used by other classes/objects. Remember that this is only a convention and is not enforced by Python (except for the double underscore prefix).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are more concepts in OOP such as Inheritance, Abstraction and Polymorphism, which would require a lot more time to cover. You may refer to reference material for explanation on these topics.*"

    "A ***backslash*** character can also be used, and it tells the interpreter that the next character – following the slash – should be treated as a new line. This character is useful when you don’t want to start a new line in the text itself but in the code.\n",

    "A ***binary file*** is any type of file that is not a text file. Because of their nature, binary files can only be processed by an application that know or understand the file’s structure. In other words, they must be applications that can ***read and interpret*** binary.\n",

    "- ***a*** – Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically amended to the end\n",

    "#### Create a text file\n",
    "Using a simple text editor, let’s create a file. You can name it anything you like, and it’s better to use something you’ll identify with.\n",
    "For the purpose of this workshop, however, we are going to call it \"testfile.txt\".\n",
    "Just create the file and leave it blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manipulate the file :\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\",\"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "file.write(\"This is our new text file\")\n",
    "file.write(\"and this is another line.\")\n",
    "file.write(\"Why? Because we can.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading a text file\n",
    "Following methods allow reading a file :\n",
    "- ***file.read():*** extract a string that contains all characters in the file.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.text\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(file.read())\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ***file.read(numberOfCharacters):*** extract only a certain number of characters.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(file.read(5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ***file.readline():*** read a file line by line – as opposed to pulling the content of the entire file at once.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(file.readline())\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ***file.readline(lineNumber):*** return a specific line\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print(file.readline(3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "- ***file.readlines():*** return every line in the file, properly separated in a list\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "print (file.readlines())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looping over file\n",
    "When you want to read – or return – all the lines from a file in a more memory efficient, and fast manner, you can use the loop over method. The advantage to using this method is that the related code is both simple and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "for line in file:\n",
    "print line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the File Write Method\n",
    "This method is used to add information or content to an existing file. To start a new line after you write data to the file, you can add an ***EOL*** (\"\\n\")) character.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"testfile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "file.write(\"This is a test\")\n",
    "file.write(\"To add more lines.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Closing a file\n",
    "When you’re done working, you can use the fh.close() command to end things. What this does is close the file completely, terminating resources in use, in turn freeing them up for the system to deploy elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to understand that when you use the fh.close() method, any further attempts to use the file object will fail.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```"

    "## Exception Handling\n",
    "There are two types of errors that typically occur when writing programs. The first, known as a ***syntax error***, simply means that the programmer has made a mistake in the structure of a statement or expression. For example, it is incorrect to write a for statement and forget the colon."

    "The other type of error, known as a ***logic error***, denotes a situation where the program executes but gives the wrong result. This can be due to an error in the underlying algorithm or an error in your translation of that algorithm. In some cases, logic errors lead to very bad situations such as trying to *dividing by zero* or trying to access an item in a list where the index of the item is outside the bounds of the list. In this case, the logic error leads to a ***runtime error*** that causes the program to terminate. These types of runtime errors are typically called ***exceptions***.    \n",

    "When an exception occurs, we say that it has been ***raised***. You can ***handle*** the exception that has been raised by using a **`try`** statement. For example, consider the following session that asks the user for an integer and then calls the square root function from the math library. If the user enters a value that is greater than or equal to `0`, the print will show the square root. However, if the user enters a negative value, the square root function will report a **`ValueError`** exception."
