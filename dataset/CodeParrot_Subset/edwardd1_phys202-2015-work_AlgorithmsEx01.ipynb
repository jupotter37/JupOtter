captains may order me about however they may thump punch me about i have satisfaction knowing all right everybody else one way or other served much same way either physical or metaphysical point view so universal thump passed round all hands should rub each other's shoulder blades be content again i always go sea sailor because they make point paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers single penny i ever heard on contrary passengers themselves must pay there all difference world between paying being paid act paying perhaps most uncomfortable infliction two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being paid what will compare with urbane activity with which man receives money really marvellous considering we so earnestly believe money be root all earthly ills on no

tell why this was exactly yet now i recall all circumstances i think i can see little into springs motives which being cunningly presented me under various disguises induced me set about performing part i did besides cajoling me into delusion was choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill discriminating judgment chief among these motives was overwhelming idea great whale himself such
