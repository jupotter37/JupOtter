The resulting ellipse parameters should recover the input parameters of the Gaussian, i.e. a major axis of $a_{\\rm ell} = 2 \\sigma_{a}$, a minor axis of $b_{\\rm ell} = 2 \\sigma_{b}$ and a position angle of $\\phi_{\\rm ell} \\equiv \\phi_{\\rm Gauss}~(\\mathrm{mod}~180^{\\circ})$, unless the Gaussian extends beyond the edges of the image, in which case the derived ellipse sizes will of course be too small."

    "The importance of source masks has been pointed out above. Here, we include a minimalistic example of how to derive an image mask using the Miriad software suite. We read in a fits file containing an observation of UGCA 105, a gas-rich dwarf galaxy. Subsequently, we convolve the image with a Gaussian to derive the image mask from the resulting data cube by clipping, using the task maths. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this filtering is that we know that most emission in the cube is of extended nature, well extending the original beam size of $40^{\\prime\\prime}$. By convolving the data cube with a Gaussian of $60^{\\prime\\prime}$ we hence enhance the signal-to-noise ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "This becomes clearer in a thought experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine convolving a data cube with statistically independent pixels and uniform rms noise not with a Gaussian but with a (not normalised) box function, the box containing n pixels. Then, as the result is simply a sum over n pixels per resulting pixel, the rms is proportional to the square root of the number of pixels. Let us assume that the source is as extended as possible, i.e. the intensity is constant across the field. Then, the signal increases by the number of pixels and hence the signal-to-noise ratio decreases by the square root of the number of pixels. If the source is the opposite of extended, i.e. a single pixel, the sum stays at the value of the single pixel and the signal-to-noise ratio decreases by the square root of the number of pixels contained in the boxcar. In reality the maths is a bit more complicated but the result stays basically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering (convolving) a cube to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio to find sources is a valid technique. However, the optimal kernel depends on the source structure and it might vary over an image. Whether source finding by clipping (creating a mask is the same as source finding) should be done at high or low resolution can be determined a-priori only by knowing more about the source structure. We know the optical extent of UGCA 105, we know that it is gas-rich, and we know that the gas in gas-rich galaxies entends over the optical disk. We hence infer that we best filter at low resolution in the given case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling interferometric radio data, we encounter an additional trap: filtering in the image domain is equivalent to tapering in the uv-domain. In other words, visibilities get downweighted by filtering (the larger the filter the more), and the result is that the rms increases overproportionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern source finders have to take into account all these facts and if they are based on a filtering and clip algorithm, what is mostly done is to apply multiple filters by default. In a second step, source candidates are often de-selected employing statistical means or a second prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we make use of the Miriad task mafia, with which we can count pixels on \"islands\". If an island contains less than a certain number of pixels, we de-select the island. This again relies on the fact that we expect contiguous, large emitting fields to be observed in this nearby galaxy. Finally, we assume that detections have a certain line width, and we enforce an island to be real only if it overlaps with an island in a neighbouring channel."

Along a line on the sky spectra are drawn in equidistant spaces, such that one axis of the PV-diagram is a spatial distance, the distance along the line, with some origin, the other is frequency or velocity. Hence, a PV-diagram is simply another slice through a data cube, geometrically equivalent to single image planes. A PV-diagram is meaningful in combination with the line(s) plotted on some image of the source.\n",

One method, which has been implemented in the [Duchamp](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Matthew.Whiting/Duchamp/) source finder, is to apply a secondary **growth threshold**. The source finder is first run with a regular flux threshold (e.g. 3&sigma;) to generate a catalogue of sources above that threshold. In a second step, the mask of each source is then grown by adding neighbouring pixels above a second, slightly lower threshold (e.g. 2&sigma;). This ensures that low-level emission is included in the source mask without increasing the number of false detections in the catalogue (as would be case if a lower flux threshold had been applied right from the start)."

The basic concept of mask optimisation is to iteratively expand the initial source mask produced by a threshold finder until the integrated flux within the mask does not increase any further. This ensures that the final mask encompasses the entire source, thereby minimising parameterisation biases. Different methods can be used to grow masks, including the use of simple elliptical masks of increasing size or the dilation of initial source masks with a specific shape."

    "One of the most fundamental corrections applies to the velocity resolution of the data. HI data cubes usually have a channel width, $\\Delta f$, that is constant in frequency. However, a constant frequency width does not translate into a constant velocity width, and the velocity resolution of a data cube therefore deteriorates with increasing redshift, with $\\Delta v = (1 + Z) \\, \\Delta v_{0}$ (see [<cite data-cite=\"2014MNRAS.442.1117D\">Davis &amp; Scrimgeour 2014</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.1117D)), where $\\Delta v_{0}$ is the velocity resolution at $Z = 0$. Therefore, a $(1 + Z)$ scaling factor will need to be applied to all velocity widths, e.g. $w_{50}$ and $w_{20}$ line widths, of sources beyond redshift zero. Velocity correction factors will also need to be applied to any other source parameters that have a dependence on velocity, for example integrated flux in units of Jy&#8239;km&#8239;s<sup>−1</sup>."

In addition to the correct $(1 + Z)$ scaling factor (blue curve), the solution for the relativistic Doppler effect (red curve) is shown in order to illustrate that the treatment of redshifts as caused by relativistic recession velocities will lead to wrong and non-sensical results beyond $Z \\approx 0.03$."

    "So far, we have only been dealing with the calculation of observational and physical parameters of HI sources. However, for a meaningful interpretation of our results we additional require knowledge of the statistical uncertainties of our measurements. Unfortunately, determination of statistical uncertainties is often hampered by several issues. One of these issues is the inherent problem that the error of a measurement based on HI data is usually by far dominated by systematic effects rather than statistical errors. Such systematic effects include\n",

    "The result of these effects is that the actual error of a measurement, e.g. integrated flux of a galaxy, is substantially larger than the calculated statistical uncertainty would suggest. As an example, let us consider a simple point source that extends across $N = 50$ spectral channels and has a constant flux density of $S = 1~\\mathrm{Jy}$ in each channel with a statistical rms noise level of $\\sigma = 0.1~\\mathrm{Jy}$. Let us further assume that there is a systematic flux calibration error of 5% ($e_{\\rm cal} = 1.05$) and a constant flux offset of $e_{\\rm bp} = 1 \\sigma = 0.1~\\mathrm{Jy}$ in each channel due to inaccurate bandpass subtraction. The measured total flux of the source is then given by"

    "while the actual total flux of the source is $N \\times S = 50~\\mathrm{Jy}$. Hence, the measured flux is $7.75~\\mathrm{Jy}$, or $15.5\\%$, too high. Furthermore, the statistical uncertainty of the measurement is only $\\sqrt{N} \\times \\sigma = 0.7~\\mathrm{Jy}$, and hence the actual measurement error is almost eleven times as large as the derived statistical uncertainty! This basic example illustrates how summation over a large number of pixels minimises the relative statistical uncertainty of a measurement, but at the same time drastically elevates the impact of any systematic errors on the result, as their contribution always acts in the same direction. As a result, the derived statistical uncertainty of the measurement is not representative of the actual measurement error, and quoting the statistical uncertainty in a publication would therefore be grossly misleading."

    "In order to determine meaningful uncertainties that incorporate both statistical and systematic components, we need to apply numerical methods such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\">Monte Carlo experiments</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29\">bootstrapping</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackknife_resampling\">jackknifing</a>. An approach often followed in previous HI surveys is the injection of a large number of **artificial sources** into empty sections of the data at an early stage of the data reduction process. These sources will then be calibrated and analysed in the same way as genuine astronomical sources. Comparison of the measured parameters of the artificial sources with their original ones will inform on the combined statistical and systematic errors introduced by the data reduction procedure."

    "Instead of injecting artificial sources into the data, a somewhat simpler approach would be to randomly **shift the source mask** to a large number of empty regions of the data cube and repeat the measurement in each case. As in the previous case, the variation of the resulting measurements will provide information on the combined statistical and systematic errors. While this method avoids the complexity of generating fake sources, it can only be used for a limited number of source parameters, in particular integrated flux measurements which simply require summation of all pixels in the mask. The uncertainties of more complex parameters, such as spectral line widths, can not be recovered with this method, as there is no analysable signal in the shifted masks."

    "Another complication arises from the fact that the distribution of errors derived through one of the numerical methods discussed above may not be Gaussian any more, in particular in the presence of strong systematic errors. Hence, the standard deviation of the derived values may no longer be a meaningful parameter to represent the uncertainty of the measurement, as the exact shape of the distribution can no longer be recovered from the standard deviation alone. In such cases, full multi-dimensional error distribution plots (or low-dimensional projections thereof) will need to be disseminated in order to characterise measurement uncertainties. An example of a non-Gaussian error distribution, here of the Busy Function parameter $b_{1}$, can be seen in the right-hand panel of the figure below."
