    "# Using hillmaker (v0.2.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll focus on basic use of hillmaker for analyzing occupancy in a typical hospital setting. The data is fictitious data from a hospital short stay unit (SSU). Patients flow through a SSU for a variety of procedures, tests or therapies. Let's assume patients can be classified into one of five categories of patient types: ART (arterialgram), CAT (post cardiac-cath), MYE (myelogram), IVT (IV therapy), and OTH (other). In addition, patients are given a severity score of 1 or 2 which is related to the amount of time required in hte SSU and the level of resources required. From one of our hospital information systems we were able to get raw data about the entry and exit times of each patient along with their patient type and severity values. For simplicity, the data is in a csv file. We are interested in occupancy statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, percentiles) by time of day and by day of week. While overall occupancy statistics are important, we are also interested in occupancy statistics for different patient types and severity levels. Since we also are interested in required staffing for this unit, we'll also use hillmaker to analyze workload levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example assumes you are already familiar with statistical occupancy analysis using the old version of [Hillmaker](http://hillmaker.sourceforge.net/) or some similar such tool. It also assumes some knowledge of using Python for analytical work.\n",

    "## Current status of code\n",
    "The new hillmaker is implemented as a Python module which can be used by importing `hillmaker` and then calling the main hillmaker function, `make_hills()` (or any component function included in the module).  This new version of hillmaker is in what I'd call an alpha state. The output does match the Access version for the ShortStay database that I included in the original Hillmaker.

    "I'll go through each of these in more detail. As a big part of the audience for this post is former users of the MS Access version of Hillmaker using the Windows OS, many of whom have little experience with tools like Python, I'll try to make the transition as easy as possible."

    "Since 2016, hillmaker has been freely available from the Python Package Index known as [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) as well as [Anaconda Cloud](http://anaconda.org/). They are similar to CRAN for R. Source code is also be available from my GitHub site https://github.com/misken/hillmaker and it is an open-source project. If you work with Python, you should know a little bit about [Python package installation](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/). There is already a companion project on GitHub called `hillmaker-examples` which contains, well, examples of hillmaker use cases. "

So, to compute occupancy statistics by `Severity` required some data wrangling (convert int to string) and to analyze occupancy by `PatType` and `Severity` required further wrangling to concatenate the two fields into a single field that we could feed to hillmaker. Note in the output above that I've included an example of such a concatenation just for illustration purposes. \n",

Note that the occupancy values are not necessarily integer since hillmaker's default behavior is to use fractional occupancy contributions for the bins in which the patient arrives and departs (e.g. if the patient arrived half-way through the time bin, they contribute 0.5 to total occupancy during that time bin). This behavior can be changed by specifying `edge_bins=2` when calling `make_hills`."

For example, let's assume that for `Severity=1` we want to have a 1:4 staff to patient ratio and for `Severity=2` we need a 1:2 ratio. Let's create a new field called `workload` using these ratios."
