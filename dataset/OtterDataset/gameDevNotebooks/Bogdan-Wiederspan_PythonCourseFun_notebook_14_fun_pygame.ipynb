    "Game development is messy and there are many ways to structure your code.\n",
    "Your game basicly consists of two parts: the initialization and the game loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization: This is the part where you set up the game, load images, set the game window and set up global variables.\n",
    "2. Game loop: This is the hearth of your game, where you update the game state and draw the game state to the screen.\n",
    "   - You also handle game logic in this part like collision detection, scoring, etc.\n",
    "   - You also handle event handling, like user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of things to handle by just 1 script, which is the reason why game development is often spread over multiple files: Handling constants, game logic, rendering, etc.\n",

    "The event queue is a list of all events that have occurred in the game. \n",

    "\n",
    "In our DINO game we want to check if the user pressed the space key to make the dino jump. \n",
    "An additional check is done if the Dino is on the ground.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for event in pygame.event.get():\n",
    "    # if arrow down is pressed\n",
    "    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n",

    "This process looks simple, but is actually quiet complex, since it depends on your game type and the needed precision. \n",

    "### Draw objects: \n",
    "Your game is 2D and consist of layers of `surfaces`.  \n",
    "You can draw on these surfaces with the `pygame.draw` module. \n",
    "Theses surfaces are drawn on top of each other, which also means that the order of drawing is important.  \n",
    "The lowest layer is the background, then the objects and the highest layer is typicaly the text.\n",

    "The update of only parts of the screen is called `dirty`, since it depends on the object of the last frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may think that `clean` drawing is inefficient, since we need to redraw more ojects. \n",
    "This is partially true. \n",
    "First of all you need to draw `clean` anyway because you need to draw the updated background and we compose the drawing surface layerwise.  \n",
    "The `clean` method can be faster, since the `dirty` method needs to check the last frame and the new frame for differences.  \n",
    "Also the `clean` method is easier to implement, and does not update so often actually, since only flipping the screen updates the screen. \n",
    "Also, it depends on the hardware you use (caching of last frames), the amount of objects you draw or the special case of your game (like not many moving objects).\n",
    "You see there are some BUTS in this statement, and for this reason we will stick to the `clean` method.\n",
    "### Print text:\n",
    "Printing text is done with the `pygame.font` module. \n",

    "# create a font object with size 36\n",
