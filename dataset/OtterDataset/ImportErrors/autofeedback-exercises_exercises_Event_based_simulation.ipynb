    "In the cell below I would like you to use these ideas to write code to estimate the probability density function for the exponential random variable.  You can do this by repeatedly sampling the random variable by calling the function that you wrote for generating it in the previous exercise multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important things to bear in mind that are different when you calculate the histogram for a continuous random variable.  The first is the way that we use the `np.floor` function to describe the continuous interval into `n` discrete bins.\n",
    "If we know that the random variable is between `min` and `max` then we can work out the widths of these bins using the following python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "delr = ( max - min ) / n\n",

    "If we now generate a random variable `U` we can work out the bin that the random falls within using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mybin = int ( ( U - min ) / delr )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can thus use the above within the normal code that we would employ to compute the histogram. Now, however, the height of the bars in the unormalized histogram are equal to the number of random variable that fall into each of the line segments of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are trying to estimate a probablity density function we must sure that the function is normalised correctly so that:\n",

    "\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\textrm{d}x = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the area under your final histogram should be one.  When you normalise the points in the list called counts you should thus divide by the number of points sampled and the width of the bins (`delr`).\n",
    "The estimates of the probability densities that once you have completed this procedure are plotted at the midpoints of the bins.  These midpoints can be generated using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(nbins) : xvals[i] = (i+0.5)*delr\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the probablity density function should be plotted using a line rather than a series of bars as it is a continuous function.  The probablity mass function that we have estimated in previous exercises only has non-zero values for particular discrete values of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, for this exercise I want you to estimate the probablity density function for the exponential random variable by sampling.   The one small problem that we have is that the exponential random variable can in theory take any value between 0 and infinity.  The probability of having a very high value for the random variable is, however, very small.  We can thus safely truncate the range and calculate our estimate of the probability density function over some finite range.\n",

I have given you a clue by introducing a variable called `time_with_length` in the class, which I have initialized to a NumPy array with `maxlen` zeros.  Every time you call the `advance_time` function you will need to update an element of this array to reflect the fact that the queue spent a certain amount of time with a particular number of customers within it.  If the number of people in the queue is greater than `maxlen` you will not update any of the elements in this array. \n",

The first element of this NumPy array is the fraction of time that there were no people in the queue, the second element is the fraction of time that there is one person in the queue, the third element is the fraction fo time that there are two people in the queue and so on.  You should be able to calculate this array of fractions from the `self.time_with_length` variable and one further variable that was introduced in the video above.\n",

We thus should really quote error bars on this estimate by repeating the simulation multiple times and calculating a variances from these multiple estimates of the histogram if we are presenting our results formally.

However, you should also bear in mind that you have a project for FCT to complete.  I would thus recommend trying to apply the ideas from this notebook to whatever phenomenon that you are trying to simulate in your chosen project.  I think the simulation code that we have written for simulating the queue offers a way of thinking about how to break down a complex phenomenon that are influenced by the interplay of multiple different random events.  For example, it should be possible to extend this code in a way that allows you to consider different types of customers (who require different amounts of time) arriving in a queue.\n",
