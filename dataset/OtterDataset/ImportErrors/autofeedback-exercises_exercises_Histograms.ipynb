    "Lets try to use the ideas in the video to estimate the probablity mass function for the Bernoulli random variable that you wrote a function to generate in the previous execise.  To complete this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will need to modify the loop that comes immediately after the function called `bernoulli` so that within this loop 100 Bernoulli random variables with parameter `prob` are generated.  In addition, you should, within this loop, count the number of times these trials were failures in element 0 of the array called `counts` and the number of times these trials were successful in element 1 of the array called `counts`.\n",

    "myvar = bernoulli(p)\n",
    "counts[int(myvar)] = counts[int(myvar)] + 1\n",

    "This works because if the trial was unsuccessful the function `bernoulli` returns a 0.  Consequently, the code above will modify element 0 of the list.  By contrast, if the trial is successful `bernoulli` returns a 1 and the above code will modify element 1 of the list.\n",
    "If you complete the exercise correctly an estimate of the probability mass function will be generated and shown.\n",

    "Lets use what we have learned from the video to write a program that calculates error bars that can be shown on a histogram using the central limit theorem.  Our histogram is going to be an estimate for the probability mass function for a binomial random variable so to complete the exercise you are going to need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a loop that calls the `binomial` function that you wrote for an earlier exercise `nsamples` times with `n=5` and `p=0.5` and that accumulates a histogram.  You should use the list called `histo` to accumulate how often each of the six possible outcomes appears in your sample of `nsamples` binomial random variables.\n",

To compute the error bars notice that the height of each bar in your normalised histogram is a sample mean computed from `nsamples` Bernoulli random variables.  In other words, the height of each bar in the histogram is an estimate of the parameter of a Bernoulli random variable, `p`.  We can thus approximate the sample variance of this Bernoulli random variable using:\n",

You should thus be able to calculate the confidence limits on each of your histogram bars by using the estimate of the variance that you obtain from the above formula together with what you know from the central limit theorem.  I would like you to plot an error bar that represents the 90% confidence limit on your estimate of the height of the bar.   To do this you will need to set the elements of the list called `error` equal to the\n",
