    "or BaseException. Instead, be specific and catch only the exceptions that you are expecting.\n",
    "This can help avoid unintended consequences and make it easier to debug issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use try-except blocks for critical sections of code: Wrap the critical sections of your\n",
    "code in try-except blocks to catch any potential exceptions that might occur. \n",
    "This can help prevent your program from crashing and allow it to recover from errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: When handling exceptions,\n",

    "exception occurs in a function, catch the exception in that function and handle it accordingly.\n",

    "5.Use finally to perform cleanup operations: Use the finally block to perform cleanup operations, \n",
    "such as closing files, releasing resources, or logging information. The code in the finally block\n",
    "is executed whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Provide meaningful error messages: When raising or catching exceptions, provide meaningful\n",
