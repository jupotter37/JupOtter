    "from metrics import extract_claims\n",
    "# Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai_wrapper'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why?\n",
    "# When you execute import openai_wrapper inside extract_claims.py, \n",
    "# Python searches for openai_wrapper in the directories listed in sys.path. \n",
    "# Initially, sys.path includes the directory containing the script that was first executed (in this case, the directory containing main.py),\n",
    "# along with other directories where Python libraries are installed. Since openai_wrapper.py is not in the same directory as main.py \n",
    "# but rather inside the metrics directory, Python can't find it by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To fix this issue, you have several options:\n",
    "# Option 1: Modify the Import Statement\n",
    "# Change the import statement in extract_claims.py to reflect the relative location of openai_wrapper.py. You can use relative imports:\n",
    "from . import openai_wrapper\n",
    "# This tells Python to look for openai_wrapper in the same directory as extract_claims.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 2: Adjust sys.path\n",
    "# You can adjust sys.path at runtime to include the directory containing openai_wrapper.py. This approach is less common and generally not recommended for simple projects due to potential issues with maintainability and the clarity of your project's structure. However, for completeness, here's how you could do it:\n",
    "# In extract_claims.py, before importing openai_wrapper, add the following:\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "sys.path.append(str(Path(__file__).parent))\n",
    "import openai_wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 3: Structuring Your Package\n",
    "# Ensure your project is structured in a way that respects Python's package structure, and then install your project (even in editable mode) using pip. \n",
    "# This way, your imports can be resolved correctly based on your package structure. This approach is more robust for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scenario 2\n",
    "# \"extract_claims.py\":\n",
    "from ..llm import OpenAILLMAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run main.py\":\n",
    "from metrics import extract_claims\n",
    "# ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why?\n",
    "# Since llm.py is not part of the metrics package (it's alongside it, not inside it), \n",
    "# you can't use relative imports from within metrics to access llm.py. \n",
    "# Relative imports (like from ..llm import OpenAILLMAgent) imply that the module being imported is part of the current package hierarchy. \n",
    "# In this case, llm.py is not inside metrics or a parent package of metrics, so a relative import is not appropriate.\n",
    "# Why is llm.py not a parent package of metrics?\n",
    "# When Running as a Script: If you run main.py as a standalone script (which seems to be the case based on your description), \n",
    "# Python does not treat the directory containing main.py as a package. \n",
    "# Therefore, llm.py is not recognized as part of a parent package when main.py is the entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option 1: absolute import. \n",
    "# \"extract_claims.py\":\n",
    "from llm import OpenAILLMAgent\n",
    "# This tells Python to look for llm.py starting from the root of your project directory (or the Python path).\n"
