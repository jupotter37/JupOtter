    "# What is Python?\n",
    "#### Python refers to a <b>open-source, high-level, object-oriented , interpreted, multipurpose, cross-platform, dynamatically typed</b> programming language.\n",
    "## Let's learn the above terms:\n",
    "#### <b>Open-Source:</b> Python is open-source, which means that its source code is freely available, and the Python community actively contributes to its development. This has led to a wealth of libraries and frameworks that extend Python's capabilities.\n",
    "#### <b>High-Level:</b> Python is a high-level programming language, which means that it abstracts many low-level details and provides a more human-readable syntax. This makes it easier to write and understand code.\n",
    "#### <b>Interpreted Language:</b> Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This makes it easy to write and test code without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "#### <b>Multi-Purpose:</b> Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has a rich standard library that includes modules for tasks such as file handling, networking, and more.\n",
    "#### <b>Cross-Platform:</b> Python is available for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like operating systems. This makes it a suitable choice for developing applications that can run on different platforms.\n",
    "#### <b>Dynamic Typing:</b> Python is dynamically typed, which means that you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Variable types are determined at runtime.\n",
    "#### <b>Object Oriented:</b> Python is designed to use objects as the fundamental building blocks of programs. In object-oriented programming, data and the functions (methods) that operate on that data are organized into \"objects.\" "

    "# Python variables:\n",
    "### In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it. Here are some key points about Python variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules:\n",
    "1. Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "2. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.\n",
    "3. Python is case-sensitive, so my_variable and My_Variable are considered different variables.\n",
    "4. Variable names cannot be a Python keyword or reserved word, such as if, else, while, for, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Assignment:\n",
    " Variables are created when you assign a value to them using the = operator. For example: x = 10 creates a variable named x and assigns it the value 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Typing:\n",
    "- Python variables are dynamically typed, which means you don't need to specify the data type explicitly.\n",
    "- The data type of a variable is determined by the value it holds.\n",
    "- For example, x = 10 creates an integer variable, while x = \"Hello\" creates a string variable. "

    "### Notes on Blocking Bad Input in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing programs, it's essential to handle user inputs properly to prevent errors, unwanted behavior, or crashes. Python provides several ways to block or handle invalid inputs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Using `try-except` for Error Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try-except` block is commonly used to handle errors, especially for type-related issues when expecting specific input formats, like numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Blocking Non-Numeric Input\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        print(f\"{number} is a valid number!\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `try` block attempts to convert the input to an integer.\n",
    "- The `except` block catches the `ValueError` (which occurs when the input is not a valid number) and displays an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Checking String Inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "To block invalid string inputs, you can add custom logic to check for specific conditions (e.g., only allowing alphabetic characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Blocking Numeric Input When Expecting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "    if name.isalpha():\n",
    "        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter only letters.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- `name.isalpha()` ensures that only alphabetic characters are accepted.\n",
    "- If the input contains numbers or special characters, the user is prompted again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Validating Input Ranges or Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're expecting input within a certain range (e.g., age), you can add additional checks to ensure the input falls within the expected limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Validating Age Input\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "        if 0 <= age <= 120:  # Valid age range\n",
    "            print(f\"Your age is {age}\")\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Please enter a valid age between 0 and 120.\")\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a numeric value for age.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Looping Until Valid Input**\n",
    "\n",
    "The common pattern is to loop until valid input is provided by the user. Combining loops with `try-except` blocks ensures that the program keeps asking for input until the user provides valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **`try-except`**: Essential for catching and handling errors like invalid types.\n",
    "- **`input validation`**: Functions like `isalpha()` or custom conditions allow you to filter out unwanted inputs.\n",
    "- **`while loops`**: Effective for repeating input prompts until the user enters valid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Blocking Bad Input:\n",
    "- **Improves User Experience**: Clear feedback is provided when the user enters invalid data.\n",
    "- **Prevents Crashes**: Proper error handling avoids program termination due to unexpected input.\n",
    "- **Increases Program Robustness**: Ensures that your program works under various input conditions.\n",

    "### General Syntax for Handling Multiple Errors:\n",
    "You can catch multiple errors by specifying multiple exception types in a single `except` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some operation\n",
    "except (TypeError, ValueError):\n",
    "    print(\"Caught a TypeError or ValueError.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **`try-except` blocks**: Essential for catching and handling runtime errors.\n",
    "- **Multiple exception handling**: You can catch specific exceptions and handle them accordingly.\n",
    "- **Graceful error handling**: Prevents the program from crashing and provides helpful feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively using `try-except` blocks, you can make your Python programs more robust, resilient to errors, and user-friendly.\n",
