    "# An explainable topological search engine with giotto-tda\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:** In this notebook, I will share my work on how one can use the `giotto-tda`-package to cluster words and create a semantical search engine, retrieving documents similar to one's query, thereby showing how we can use topological techniques in the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** We will be using the classical [*reuters*](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html) dataset, consisting of around 10K news documents collected from Reuters (inherently available in the *nltk* package). We will also use pre-trained word vectors, available through the *gensim* API. These are the [*word2vec-google-news-300*](https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors). "

    "## How do we use giotto-tda for a search engine?! \n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to briefly explain the methodology and intuition behind this search engine.. \n",
    "\n",
    "A problem with many search engine techniques today is that they rely on the words to exist in the corpus of document we already have. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we search for certain terms in a collection of documents, many methods often look for the specific words, which can be troublesome. An example of this is the work from a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/amitkumarjaiswal/nlp-search-engine) by Amit Kumar Jaiswal. Here, words are removed if they do not exist in the vocabulary of the previous documents. This is of course not applicable to advanced search engines, and work arounds exist, but we might miss semantic meanings and important information sometimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "A tool that allows for constructing a search engine mitigating this problem is the Mapper in `giotto-tda`. By taking the word vectors of all the words existing in a collection of documents, we can create a graph from these word vectors by using the mapper method. Each node will then work as a cluster of words that are similar and are used in the same context. Due to the inherent nature of word vectors, words are perceived as similar when they are used in the same context (see [Mikolov et al.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2013/file/9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf)), and this can be measured with the use of the cosine similarity. We therefore use the cosine distance as our distance metric when constructing our graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the mapper therefore allows us to cluster the words into an arbitrary number of clusters, **not a determined number of clusters**, with words that are similar in terms of semantical meaning. If a word does not exist, we can rely on its neighbours, defined through the vertices it belongs to, to fetch document that might be about similar topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This mapper graph can then be used to query the data and retrieve documents. Each document has words belonging to different nodes, as different words end up in different nodes based on which words they are similar to. A document will therefore implicitly belong to many different nodes as it contains many words. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can explain a query in a few steps. For a demonstration, look below, but here I will simply explain it in words. Let's say a word is searched for, say `China`. We then look up which nodes this word belongs to, which also contains other words and therefore many different documents. We look at all documents that have words in those nodes, and the documents are ranked *based on their percent of words contained in the same node as the query*. In the simple example of *china*, we simply rank all documents based on the percentage of their words they have in the same nodes as the query. If a word does not exist in the corpus, we can simply leverage the word vectors and derive the most similar word that exist in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of the mapper graph therefore works as an efficient way of clustering words and implicitly creating what one might call a topological signature for each document. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A brief mathematical formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following: \n",
    "1. A vocabulary $\\mathcal{V}$ consisting of words. \n",
    "2. A corpus of documents $\\mathcal{C} = \\{d_1, ..., d_m\\} = \\{\\{w_{11},..,w_{1n_1}, ... ,{w_{m1},..,w_{mn_m}}\\}\\}$ where $w_{ij} \\in \\mathcal{V}$\n",
    "3. A word2vec model mapping words to vectors, $f_{w2vec} : \\mathcal{V} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^D$ (in our case, $D = 300$). \n",
    "4. A `giotto-tda` mapper graph function mapping the vectors to a graph $\\mathcal{G} := (V, E)$ such that $f_{mapper} : \\mathbb{R}^D \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$\n",
    "5. The vertices can each contain an arbitrary number of words, such that $V = \\{v_1, ..., v_k\\} = \\{\\{w_{11},..,w_{1l_1}\\},...,\\{w_{z1},..,w_{zl_z}\\}\\}$ (do not confuse these sets with the sets in point 2!).\n",
    "6. Now, for a query $\\mathcal{Q} = \\{w_1, ... , w_s\\}$, we consider a query function obtaining all the nodes that $\\mathcal{Q}$ is in, such that $f_{q} : \\mathcal{Q} \\rightarrow V$. We also use a function mapping the documents in $\\mathcal{C}$ and a set of vertices $V$ to a real-valued ranking scalar, such that $f_{rank} : \\mathcal{C}, V, Q \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. This function $f_{rank}$ is currently as seen below. In short terms, it is the number of words that the document has in the same nodes as the query has its words, in proportion to the total number of words that a document has. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{rank}(d_i, V, Q) = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\sum_{a=1}^z \\sum_{k=1}^{|f_{\\mathcal{Q}}(Q)|} \\mathbb{1}(w_{jn_i}\\in v_{k})}{|d_i|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It was later seen that this algorithm favoured short documents due to its nature. Therefore, I introduced a bias for larger documents, as seen below. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{rank}(d_i, V, Q) = c \\cdot \\log(|d_i|) \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\sum_{a=1}^z \\sum_{k=1}^{|f_{\\mathcal{Q}}(Q)|} \\mathbb{1}(w_{jn_i}\\in v_{k})}{|d_i|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is giotto-tda involved? \n",
    "\n",
    "As I probably already answered, the most important underlying concept in this case is the mapper pipeline; mapping the data points in the point cloud to a graph which we can query is actually the main underlying mechanism of this search engine. "

As an example, if a document has many of its words in a neighbor to the node of the query, it can still be a highly relevant document for the query in question. \n",
    "- Constructing a Mapper graph is in many ways an arbitrary process, in which it is not always clear which filtering function and which overlap fractions and number of partitions we should use. In further work, one should investigate whether it is better with richer representations containing more nodes (higher number of partitions) and rich connectivity, as opposed to larger nodes (with fewer partitions) and lower connectivity. A higher connectivity means more words will belong to more nodes, yielding a more descriptive representation of each document. It is clear that this method can be further refined by further examination. \n",
    "- The filtering function should also be investigated as to which one is the best to use. \n",
    "- Currently, due to the way we rank, the algorithm clearly favors smaller documents, simply because we disregard their size. One way to possibly mitigate this is to simply induce a bias based on the size of the document. We have introduced a punisher for smaller documents where we can intentionally introduce a bias towards larger or smaller documents, but a better solution rather than an adjustable hyper parameter would be to prefer. \n",
    "- My last point relates to my first and fourth point; how we rank the documents now, by matching the query's corresponding nodes with the document having its highest percentage of words in the same nodes will favor smaller documents and simultaneously not regard neighboring nodes, which is especially important in a rich graph format. \n",

    "More work is absolutely needed to improve these results; most of all, this method can clearly be fine-tuned to work better. Either way, this notebook serve as a demonstration that `giotto-tda` and topology has its place within Natural Language Processing. It also shows, for a few sets of queries, that it is not necessarily inferior to classical methods such as BM25; with more adjustments, it could probably even perform better. "
