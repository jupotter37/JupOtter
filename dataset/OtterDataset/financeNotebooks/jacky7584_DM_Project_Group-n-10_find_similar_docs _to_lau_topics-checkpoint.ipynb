The question never asked is, Why don't the souls in hell ask God for forgiveness? Dante had the logical answer: God has denied the damned the ability to utter that prayer; in other words, God keeps hell running. Hell is an embarrassment to Christianity. It's nice that the church is making progress, but it still refuses to face the fact that for hell to be a part of its belief system, God's mercy must be finite and his love limited.

       "[\"response task stimulus effect visual condition participant processing experiment movement Thanks to advanced new imaging techniques, the internal world of the mind is becoming more and more visible. Just as X-rays reveals our bones, the latest brain scans reveal the origins of our thoughts, moods and memories. Scientists can observe how the brain registers a joke or experiences a painful memory; they can find clues to what may cause addiction and conditions like autism, depression and attention deficit disorder. Imaging has shown, for instance, that men start losing brain tissue earlier and in larger chunks than women do. Men are particularly prone to tissue loss in the frontal and temporal lobes, areas associated with thinking and feeling, while women tend to lose tissue in the hippocampus and parietal areas, which are associated with memory and visual and spatial abilities. Brain scans have also shown that no single part of the brain is responsible for pain; rather it occurs when the areas associated with attention and emotion are activated. Below are image and excerpts from ''Mapping the Mind'' (University of California Press, 1998) by Rita Carter. THINK TANK\",\n",
