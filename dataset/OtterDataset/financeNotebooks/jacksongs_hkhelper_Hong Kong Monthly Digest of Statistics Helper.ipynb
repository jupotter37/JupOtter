    "Hong Kong Monthly Digest of Statistics Helper\n",
    "====\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes analysis of the monthly digest of statistics from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) pulls the statistics from the 11 monthly CSVs, from all available monthly releases, into one dataset\n",
    "    b) works out which statistics have a monthly frequency\n",
    "    c) collects all the available monthly CSV datasets to make longer analysis using monthly statistics possible\n",
    "    d) makes charts for each statistic and sorts them by the size of the 1 month, 12 month and 24 months percentage point changes\n",
    "    \n",
    "To use is, just run this notebook. It should only take a couple of minutes. Then look inside the \"charts\" folder for the current day. Browse the statistics' charts ordered in either 1 month, 12 month or 24 month changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *it ignores figures that aren't monthly and datasets with percentages\n",
    "    *statistics with a date range are also excluded\n",
    "    *some datasets like imports from Vietnam and Philippines have no 2020 data\n",
    "    \n",
    "In future the script could also recognise changes to the monthly release, including whether the Department is reducing its coverage or amending statistics. It could also be used to produce raw data for other chart tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *requests\n",
    "    *Beautiful Soup\n",
    "    *pandas\n"
