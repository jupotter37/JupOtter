The TSE 300 Index climbed 50.15 points to close at 5900.37 in heavy turnover of 84.07 million shares worth C$1.4 billion. But the overall market was mixed with declining issues narrowly outpacing advances 476 to 464. 298 issues were flat. Frantic trading in Bre-X collapsed the TSE's computer trading system earlier in the day, forcing the exchange to halt trading in the stock before the market closed. Shares in the Calgary-based gold prospector were halted for a statement by the company this morning. When it resumed, a whopping 7.7 million shares changed hands in the first 22 minutes of trading before the system crashed. Bre-X closed up 1.35 at 3.85. It was the first time Bre-X traded since investors lopped nearly C$3 billion off its stock market value last Thursday. TSE officials said the trading problems were due to old technology which will be replaced. On the Montreal Exchange, Bre-X closed up 0.81 at 3.50 on 9.8 million shares. Analysts predicted more volatility for Bre-X shares this week. \"The question of what Bre-X will release over the next few days will be important to the market,\" said Josef Schachter, of Schachter Asset Management Inc. The gold sector rose nearly 136 points, leading 12 of 14 sub-indices higher. Other strong groups included financial services, consumer products, energy and transportation. The TSE posted minor losses in forestry and real estate. --- HOT STOCKS --- * Among bank shares, Bank of Nova Scotia rose 0.65 to 51.50 on 2.1 million shares, while Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce added 0.50 to 31.80 on 2.1 million shares.

      "Libya's Gaddafi arrives by air for Niger prayers. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi arrived by Libyan airlines plane in the capital of the impoverished West African country of Niger on Thursday to lead Moslem prayers, witnesses said. The United Nations imposed a ban on flights from Libya in 1992 over the Lockerbie bombing of an airliner in 1988. The control tower at Niamey's international airport declined to comment on whether the ban had been broken. Gaddafi and his entourage arrived in four Boeing 727 jets and were met by Niger's president. \"I came to bring support and sympathy to President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, to the government and Nigerien people,\" Gaddafi told reporters on arrival. The Libyan news agency JANA on Wednesday said Gaddafi would lead prayers in both Niger and Nigeria during a visit to West Africa as leader of the Islamic Popular Leadership, an Islamic organisation he created in 1989. Gaddafi's last trip abroad was by land to Tunisia in October 1996. He earlier violated the U.N. ban when a Libyan-registered plane flew him to Cairo and back to attend an Arab summit in June 1996.\n",

      "Kredyt Bank buys PBI, Prosper banks. The National Bank of Poland, the central bank, agreed to sell Polish Investment Bank (PBI) and Prosper Bank in a joint deal to Kredyt Bank for 205 million zlotys and investment guarantees, the NBP deputy head said. \"We have just signed an agreement on the sale of two NBP-owned banks,\" Witold Kozinski told a news conference. \"This transaction of joining Kredyt Bank and PBI bank consolidates the Polish banking system and helps to save once and for all the fate of Prosper Bank,\" Kozinski added. Kozinski said Kredyt Bank would take over 100 percent of PBI and 92.36 percent of Prosper Bank. Kredyt Bank vowed to invest in Prosper 160 million zlotys which is roughly equivalent to its debts and increase the bank's capital to five million Ecu within several years. It also will raise the share capital of PBI by 100 million zlotys within a year and pledged to invest another 25 million zlotys in PBI's computer infrastructure. The deal also envisions the possibility of PBI employees buying some of the bank's shares, Kozinski said. Kredyt Bank president Stanislaw Pacuk, also present, said the bank would use some of its own capital to pay for the banks but gave no further details on the deal's financing. \"The merger will make Kredyt Bank and PBI Poland's eighth largest bank in terms of assets,\" Pacuk said. Kozinski said Kredyt outbid Austria's Creditanstalt, the other shortlisted bidder, and U.S. GE Capital, which did not make the final cut-off. At the end of 1996 PBI had capital of 197.1 million zlotys, a balance sheet total of 4.56 billion zlotys and recorded a 55.2 million zloty net profit that year. Prosper Bank, 93-percent owned by the central bank, has capital of 16.1 million zlotys and an accumulated loss of 161 million zlotys. It has a balance sheet total of 557 million zlotys. Under the conditions of the tender investors who wanted to buy PBI were also required to buy Prosper Bank. At the end of 1996 Kredyt Bank had capital of 219 million zlotys, making a net profit that year of 23.2 million zlotys. Its balance sheet total was 1.07 billion zlotys. -- Wojciech Moskwa +48 22 653 9700\n",

      "Illegal immigrants drown off Moroccan coast. Fourteen Moroccan illegal immigrants drowned on their way to Spain after their makeshift boat sank off the Moroccan coast, a daily newspaper said on Tuesday. L'Opinion said the 14 would-be immigrants died late last week after their boat was wrecked off the coast of the northern city of Tangier. The last body was washed ashore on Saturday. It said police were still looking for three people -- the boat's owner and two would-be immigrants -- who are thought to have survived. Hundreds of Moroccans and nationals of other African countries try each year to reach Europe illegally in makeshift boats Late last year, a Moroccan fisherman was jailed for four years after 26 would-be immigrants he was shipping to Spain drowned. He was the only survivor. Each of his passengers had paid him 4,000 dirhams ($420) for the trip.

      "TIFFE Euroyen ends lower, pressured by JGB fall. May 27 settlement  prev settlement TIFFE Euroyen 3M (Z)     98.85\t\t  98.90 --------------------------------------------------------------- Key December three-month Euroyen futures settled lower on Tuesday after coming under downward pressure from sharp sales of Japanese government bond (JGB) futures, but traders said further falls were unlikely. Key June JGB futures slipped after options-linked sales and poor results from a four-year note auction. The December Euroyen futures contract ended at 98.85 after moving from 98.84 to 98.90. Turnover was 92,483 contracts. \"The market was led today mainly by the moves in JGBs, with virtually no fresh factors in the Euroyen futures market itself,\" one city bank trader said. JGB traders said the sharp fall in the key June 10-year bond futures may have been triggered by sales from hedge funds, said to be holding a large number of June JGB put options with a strike price of 123.00. Although the key December Euroyen contract went as low as 98.84 at one point, it then appeared to recover slightly on short-covering, a trader with a securities firm said, adding that slides below 98.81 in the short term seem unlikely. He added, and the city bank trader agreed, that the key December is likely to move roughly in a 98.85-98.95 range over the next few days. \"Rises much beyond this are unlikely for now, as the impact of Sakakibara's comments last week still lingers, keeping the topside heavy,\" he said. Senior MOF official Eisuke Sakakibara was quoted as saying last week that a rise in Japan's discount rate should be expected in the coming year. A trust bank dealer said the market will be reluctant to move aggressively until the release of April industrial production figures on Thursday. In the interbank market, key overnight call money was traded at around 0.52 percent, up from Monday's 0.51 percent. Traders said this appeared to be due to increasing funds demand ahead of the month-end. Around 200 billion worth of long end benchmark three month certificates of deposit (CDs) were issued at 0.60 percent, highest since March 25 and up from 0.58 percent Friday. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) injected 600 billion yen into the money market in its regular morning operation, against a projected 600 billion yen shortfall. The operation was in line with market expectations. --E. Lies +81-3-3432-8806\n",

      "Eurotunnel says debt terms talks advancing. Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA/Plc on Wednesday said debt restructuring talks with a banking consortium were making progress but were not yet completed. Participating banks confirmed that there had been progress in the talks aimed at setting final terms for restructuring the tunnel operator's nine billion pounds ($14.6 billion) of debt but said the outcome was as yet uncertain. \"Our conversations with the banks are continuing and advancing very well but we cannot confirm at the moment that we have reached an agreement,\" a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the steering committee of leading bankers had agreed final terms. But a banking source said: \"I think that's a bit premature. It's not that simple.\" The Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the tunnel operator could not speak for the banks but that in any case final terms would still have to be approved by other banks in the consortium as well as Eurotunnel's own board. Officials of the steering committee's leading banks all declined comment on the report, saying they feared public discussion could sink an eventual pact. But banking sources said the steering committee's 20 instructing banks would meet to weigh the deal's terms prior to April 24, when Eurotunnel plans to release its 1996 results. The terms would then have to be approved by the remainder of the 225 lender banks, the Eurotunnel board and shareholders at a special July shareholder meeting. \"Even after the banks agree, the shareholders must be convinced that this deal is still in their own interests,\" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"So there has been progress but many questions remain unanswered. There is still a long way to go,\" the analyst said. Analysts said a key question hanging over the restructuring talks was an expected report by safety authorities on new safety procedures adopted by Eurotunnel following a November 18 fire in the tunnel which slightly injured 34 people. The blaze on board a train carrying a truck badly damaged and forced the closure of one of two rail tunnels. Eurotunnel hopes to complete repairs on the south tunnel by mid-May. Eurotunnel officials have said they were confident the revised safety procedures announced earlier this month would be approved by the Anglo-French Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, which was expected to issue its own report on the blaze soon. However, \"if there is any suggestion that the (safety panel) wants major safety changes, this has major ramifications for the debt talks,\" said analyst Jeff Summers of London's Klesch & Co. The fire had cast a shadow over the debt talks after restructuring was agreed in principle with steering committee banks last October. The company triggered the debt restructuring after invoking a debt standstill in September 1995, since extended. Despite the standstill, traders said a lively secondary market had emerged in Eurotunnel debt, with it being bid at about 43.5 cents on the dollar at this time. The market had trended upwards in the last few weeks in anticipation of news about the restructuring talks, the traders said, rising as high as 45 to 46 cents on the dollar from levels of around 41 cents. Some of the lender banks have demanded a formalised secondary market and \"an official quotation system for the debt instruments could well emerge as part of the debt restructuring plan,\" one banking source told Reuters. Establishment of a formal secondary market could encourage reluctant banks to accept the restructuring plan by making it easier for them to sell off their Eurotunnel debt once the pact was in place. -- Paris newsroom +33 1 4221 5452\n",

      "CZECH PHILIP MORRIS UNIT TO RAISE CIGARETTE PRICES. Tabak a.s., the Czech unit of U.S.-based Philip Morris Cos said on Wednesday that it was raising cigarette prices by up to one crown per pack, effective July 7. \"The main reason for this increase is the growth in production prices, mainly for tobacco which is purchased in U.S. dollars,\" a Tabak statement said. The statement said the price of a package of king size cigarettes would rise by one crown, while packages of cigarettes of up to 70cm in length would rise by 0.5 crowns. In May the Czech crown came under heavy pressure by speculators, which pushed the currency to record lows before the central bank was forced to freely float it. The crown has lost more than 18 percent of its value against the dollar this year. Tabak produces many of the Czech Republic's most popular brands of cigarettes -- including Marlboros and Petras -- producing some 26 billion cigarettes in 1996. Tabak holds an estimated 80 market share in the Czech Republic. -- Alan Crosby, Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003\n",

      "Dollar sinks below 111 yen amid trade jitters. The dollar slipped to its lowest level against the yen in almost seven months on Wednesday, sinking to 110.97 yen in Tokyo as a sharp rise in Japan's sensitive current account surplus fuelled worries over trade tension. The dip below 111 yen took the dollar to its lowest level since November 20, 1996. The dollar was temporarily lifted in the morning after the release of trade figures which were mostly in line with market expectations, but it soon resumed its downward march on worries over renewed U.S.-Japan trade friction, dealers said. The worries were aggravated by remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who said that Japan should foster demand-led recovery at home and avoid running up external surpluses that would hurt global growth. Traders are speculating that the Japanese government will have to let the yen climb in order to keep its ballooning trade surplus in check ahead of the meeting of the world's seven leading industrialised nations in Denver later this month. The dollar closed at 112.17/22 yen in New York on Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced that the surplus in the current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, rose 92.7 percent to 1.09 trillion yen ($9.8 billion) in April from a year earlier.

      "MGM, Metromedia hammer out $550 mln deal - Variety. An agreement in principle has been worked out to sell Metromedia Entertainment Group's Orion Pictures and Goldwyn Entertainment assets to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc, Daily Variety said on Thursday. According to sources close to both companies, the deal was said to be for about $550 million in a complex arrangement including assumption of debt, notes and cash, Variety said. Both sides were quoted as declining to comment. Sources said notes would not be issued by MGM, indicating MGM co-owner and Tracinda Corp chief Kirk Kerkorian could be financing the purchase, Variety reported. Other sources familiar with the talks have told Reuters Metromedia is in talks with MGM and Kerkorian regarding the sale of Metromedia's film library to MGM. They said they believed MGM and Kerkorian had made a preliminary bid just above $300 million for Metromedia's 2,200-title catalog. Analysts have also said Metromedia's entertainment assets could fetch between $500 million and $650 million. Variety said Metromedia's Landmark arthouse theater group was not part of the deal and would be sold later. ((New York newsdesk 212-859-1610))\n",

      "Wanted - experienced oil traders, pay no obstacle. Booming business on the European oil trading scene has forced up salaries for key crude dealing staff as companies compete for a small pool of skilled traders. The major players -- integrated oil majors and private trading companies -- are finding it increasingly difficult to land traders with the necessary experience, leading dealers said on Wednesday. \"The trouble is there hasn't been an inflow of junior traders over the last few years. It's just been the old names sitting around getting fat,\" one senior crude oil trader at a major European company said. Surging North Sea crude output, a very volatile market and healthy profits last year have all contributed to the money to be made by those who trade oil. \"Everyone had a good year last year so there is plenty of money on the table....just not enough people for it,\" another trader said. Top traders last year were reputed to have earned as much as a million pounds. \"This (price) volatility has brought lots of extra deals and interest into the market,\" said a crude dealer at an independent trading company. \"The funds and banks get involved on a more regular basis nowadays. More hands are needed to cover this volatility as well as the extra North Sea barrels.\" The market news this week was that another two traders had moved jobs -- this time from Shell Trading and Shipping Company (Stasco). Shell declined comment on the market in traders. Both dealers are believed to have moved to one of the large international banks. One trader with a major oil company said his company would need to change its practices to attract the talented traders now in such short supply. \"We are in danger of becoming a college after college and need to shape up and build incentive packages or we will lose people and find it very hard to hire,\" he said. So far this year Amoco Corp and J.Aron (the trading arm of Goldman Sachs) have hired crude traders. Still searching are Norway's Statoil, looking for two traders, British Petroleum, willing to train juniors and Swiss-based independent Vitol SA. J. Aron was looking to add to its team, traders said. Enterprise Oil has just hired. A dealer with one of these companies said the going price for an experienced trader had soared in the past two years. \"We're up probably over 100 per cent,\" he said. One major oil company, normally more conservative with salaries, was said to have offered in excess of 100,000 stg ($162,000) per annum for a trader with a few years experience. A couple of years ago the figure would have been more like 40-50,000 stg. Crude oil trading is now having to compete with the banking world on incentive schemes as well as basic salaries and bonuses. Traders say some are offering sign-on fees of one year's salary. \"This has been going on in the banking world for a while but it's new for the oil market,\" another trader said. Some of the majors, such as BP, run a bonus and share incentive scheme and with a fairly large group of experienced traders can continue to take in junior traders with limited experience and at relatively low salaries and train them up. Some companies are examining their strategy both for finding qualified people and keeping them. Statoil is among those trying to adapt to the new environment. \"We are reviewing our employment system and following the situation very closely in order that we can maintain the high quality service that is required in this tough world of trading,\" said John Ove Lindoe senior vice president of public affairs with Statoil. --London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8978 ($ = 0.613 British Pounds)\n",

      "Ex-worker sues NY Times, cites religion. A former office worker at the New York Times Co sued the newspaper company on Thursday, charging that as a Jew she was the victim of religious discrimination. Miriam Humbach of Manhattan, who was employed in the flagship newspaper's circulation department from January, 1987 to August 1995, said she was ultimately fired \"on the basis of her sex.\" A N.Y. Times spokeswoman said the company has not seen the lawsuit, so it could not comment. Humbach claimed in the suit she was required by her boss to work overtime on September 15, 1994, the evening of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, the holiest day of the Jewish year, and the following day, the holiday. She alleged she was also required to work on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, later that month. She claimed she had scheduled the time off. She alleged that her boss told her she was \"not entitled to special treatment because she is Jewish.\" She also alleged that she was terminated out of seniority due to her sex, while two less senior male workers were retained.\n",

During fiscal 1997 both the company and the franchisor made changes to the East Side Mario's restaurants which were expected to improve results but did not, Morgan's said. The company said that of the $2,939,000 in asset impairment charges reported by the company in fiscal 1997, $1,239,000 represents the write off of goodwill related to the 1987 purchase of the company's St. Louis Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. Earlier, Morgan's Foods reported a fourth quarter net loss of $3,784,000 or $0.21 per share against a net loss of $436,000 or $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of 1996.\n",

      "Japan money to flow overseas despite dollar risk. With the lure of higher yields, Japanese institutions are expected to keep pouring money into the United States despite the risk of a falling dollar, senior currency traders and strategists say. \"Life insurers appear ready to pour another three trillion yen ($23.8 billion) into foreign bonds,\" said Taisuke Tanaka, market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"These plans are unlikely to be changed unless Tokyo drastically alters its macroeconomic policies and narrows the interest rate gap (with the United States),\" he said. The analysts believe that Washington -- despite public comments to the contrary -- could try to push the dollar lower in order to narrow the growing trade deficit with Japan. \"Stepped up warnings from the U.S. Treasury against a surge in Japan's trade surplus are a prelude to a strategy of pushing the dollar down to help boost the much-wounded competitiveness of U.S. exporters,\" said a strategist at a local investment advisory firm. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said here on Friday that Japan should not let its current account surplus rise sharply again. He rejected suggestions that a stronger yen was the best way to head off a rising surplus. Strategists, however, said that true U.S. foreign exchange policies are better reflected in the recent statements of leading U.S. economists whom they feel may be privy to the U.S. Treasury's true intentions. \"Our Treasury, at least implicitly, is now calling for (a stronger yen),\" said Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. official who now heads the Institute for International Economics. Currency traders said that Washington may wait a while before taking any action on exchange rates. \"Washington appears to be giving Japan some breathing space to achieve domestic-led growth without using exports to fuel growth,\" said Takeshi Hanai, executive manager of Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd's International Treasury Department. He said that if Japan fails to achieve those objectives, the United States will signal an end to its strong-dollar policy. Such a scenario is hardly fertile ground for increased U.S. investment, but with record low yields at home and rising rates in America, the capital outflow is expected to grow. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond is a hefty 4.77 percentage points above the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond. Life insurers bought 3.43 trillion yen ($27.2 billion) in foreign bonds and stocks in 1996. Insurers said that U.S. investment would pay off even if the dollar falls from its current level of 126 yen to 115 yen. And they said that the U.S. market is again attractive even though Japanese investors encountered huge foreign exchange losses on foreign bond investment in the late 1980s. \"Most of the insurers that lost trillions of yen on foreign bond investments in the late 1980s finished writing off those losses in the past two years, reviving their capacity for risk-taking (in foreign bonds),\" said Yoshiichi Taguchi, strategist at Tokio Marine MC Asset Management Co Ltd. Furthermore, institutional investors have shed many of their cross-shareholdings in other Japanese companies, as planned financial reforms under Japan's \"Big Bang\" will render them less useful in cementing corporate ties. Proceeds from these sales of shares have left financial firms flush with cash, much of which has been earmarked for foreign bond purchases, the analysts say.\n",

      "USTR Barshefsky says Japan \"stalled\" on auto accord. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Monday that the U.S. automotive trade deficit with Japan is getting worse and that Tokyo has fallen short in fulfilling an agreement to open its market. \"There is no question that Japan has stalled on deregulation in this sector. That is of significant concern and inexcusable,\" Barshefsky said in an interview with Reuters. \"There is no question that the number of vehicle dealerships is also not adequate.\" A 1995 U.S.- Japan trade agreement, reached after contentious negotiations in which the two countries neared the brink of a trade war, calls on Tokyo to deregulate automotive parts markets in order to give foreign suppliers more access. It also calls on the Japanese government to encourage more dealers to sell American brand cars. Since the agreement, the trade deficit in the automotive sector has deteriorated, not improved, according to Barshefsky. She said the automotive sector now accounts for 66 percent of the U.S. deficit with Japan, compared to 60 percent two years ago. \"The numbers are disturbing,\" said Barshefsky, who along with U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has told Tokyo that Washington does not want Japan to run up significant surpluses or export its way out of economic difficulties. The number of Japanese automobile dealers that have signed up to sell cars made by Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. has fallen far short of expectations. The American Automobile Manufacturers Association said that since the 1995 agreement was signed, 126 new dealerships have agreed to sell American cars. That is far short of the 200 expected by the end of the first year of the agreement and the 400 that were expected by the end of 1997. Barshefsky said the United States will raise those issues during a review of the auto trade accord in September. That is one of a number of issues that could heighten U.S. trade tensions with Japan over the next few months. An agreement with Japan on procurement of telecommunications equipment by Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) is set to expire in September and the two sides will sit down for talks next week. The United States has said it expected American companies to gain a bigger share of equipment sales to NTT and its subsidiaries give the competitiveness of U.S. firms in other markets and in sales to the private sector in Japan. At the same time, U.S. officials are gearing up for more talks with Japan on civil aviation. Washington has been pushing for an \"open skies\" agreement that would remove limits on service, but Tokyo is resisting that idea. The United States and Japan will also be trying to resolve a dispute over Japanese port practices. The U.S. Federal Maritime Commission has suspended proposed sanctions against Japanese shipping companies until Sept. 4 to give Japan time to resolve some of the port issues that Washington says are unfair to foreign liners. On China, Barshefsky said talks were being held in Geneva this week on Beijing's bid to join the World Trade Organisation. Bilateral talks between the United States and China will take place later this week. But Barshefsky said that, based on what U.S. officials heard of talks with other WTO partners this week, Beijing's latest offer was \"tepid.\" She said Beijing has been \"unresponsive\" to concerns of some countries, particularly the European Union. \"We will see what they do in our bilateral,\" she added.\n",

      "NZ dlr rises, rates fall to keep conditions static. The New Zealand dollar climbed back above 69 U.S. cents at the open on Friday in an apparent contradiction of this week's easing in monetary conditions. But dealers said several large orders had bound the Kiwi temporarily to the newly-buouyant Australian currency, which was dragging it higher. \"There's a couple of large orders around to buy Kiwi and sell Aussie,\" said a chief bank dealer. \"So what's going to happen probably for the next day or so is you'll see Kiwi actually move in tandem with the Aussie, because people are trying to protect these orders and stop them getting triggered.\" At Friday midday, the Kiwi was trading at US$0.6902/09 and at 68.64 on its Trade-Weighted Index, up from 0.6878/85 and 68.46 at Thursday's close. On Tuesday, lower-than-expected March quarter inflation data sparked an easing in monetary conditions, with 90-day interest rates falling 17 basis points and the currency shedding 20 points. Dealers said the Kiwi's strength on Friday, particularly in its Trade-Weighted Index, was helping rates to fall further but keeping the overall level of monetary conditions static. \"If Kiwi keeps moving up with the Aussie, the TWI will keep moving higher and our interest rates will keep moving lower again,\" the chief dealer said. However, he said lower rates made the Kiwi less attractive to hold, which would eventually become an issue for the currency. \"It's becoming less and less attractive to hold Kiwi because you're just not picking up the returns. \"You've got higher interest rates in the United States and lower interest rates here, so the gap between U.S. interest rates and our interest rates has narrowed very considerably,\" he said. \"It will get to the point where the Kiwi will fall off quite markedly, but that could be a few weeks away.\" -- Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746\n",

      "German leaders see no chance of costly EU job deal. German political leaders said on Sunday they were firmly opposed to French proposals for a costly drive to make jobs for Europe's 18 million unemployed. Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top deputy Wolfgang Schaeuble all dismissed the French ideas as obsolete and said there was no chance Germany would agree to them at the European Union's summit in Amsterdam on Monday and Tuesday. \"We will stick to our position that there will be no money flowing from Germany for additional jobs creation programmes,\" Waigel told Reuters on the fringes of an official ceremony in the Bavarian town of Bad Woerishofen. The summit, called to agree a new EU treaty, has been overshadowed by a rift between France and Germany over how to proceed toward monetary union. EU countries hoped the summit would ratify a German-designed stability pact intended to impose discipline for the proposed single European currency by punishing nations failing to adhere to strict fiscal standards. But France's new Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin upset the plans by demanding last week that the 18 million jobless in the EU be taken into account. Kohl, who met French leaders on Friday in an unsuccessful bid to reach agreement, ran into a stormy protest from 2,700 farmers who gathered outside the Bad Woerishofen ceremony on Sunday with banners reading \"Farm Killer\" and \"Helmut Kohl Is To Germany What Mad Cow Disease Is To England\". \"We are doing everything humanly possible in Brussels,\" Kohl told them. \"A society without farmers would be a poor society.\" Waigel told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung Bonn had ruled out participating. \"I will not go along with (state job creation programmes) under which Germany pays one third to Europe and gets only 15 percent back,\" Waigel told the newspaper. He expected some form of agreement on job strategies at the summit meeting but said this would not be tied in with additional spending. Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of Kohl's Christian Democrats in parliament, said most EU nations were on Germany's side in the dispute and said raising taxes and debt to finance jobs schemes had failed in the past and wouldn't work in the future. \"The problem of unemployment cannot be resolved with higher taxes or higher borrowing,\" Schaeuble told Der Spiegel newsweekly. \"Deficit-spending to create new jobs and boost the economy is an obsolete economic theory.\" Kinkel, in an interview with Welt am Sonntag newspaper, said there would be a chapter in the Amsterdam treaty on employment but there would not be any new spending for it. \"There will be no transfer from Germany of additional authorities to the EU and no additional funding,\" Kinkel said. Edmund Stoiber, a leading conservative and well-known euro-sceptic turned up the volume on Sunday, saying the euro must be delayed if the stability targets are not met and warned politicians will lose public confidence if they trade the mark for a weaker currency. The Bavarian premier said in an interview with Bild am Sonntag newspaper that replacing the mark with a weaker single European currency could harm German democracy. \"The overriding question for politicians and especially for the public at large is not when the euro will be introduced but rather whether it is a stable euro,\" Stoiber said. \"The mark is inseparably linked to our 'economic miracle',\" Stoiber added. \"And anyone who would replace the strong mark with a weaker euro and thus turn the currency conversion into a currency reform would destroy the public's confidence in politicians and damage democracy in Germany.\" Stoiber's remarks came as a Forsa research institute survey found a slim majority of Germans against the euro. The survey of 1,011 Germans found that 51 percent opposed the euro's introduction while 34 percent were in favour. The Bundesbank, meanwhile, denied a report in Der Spiegel claiming central bank president Hans Tietmeyer had urged the creation of a plan to ensure an orderly delay in monetary union.\n",

      "India postpones oil price debate for third time. India's ruling United Front coalition has postponed a meeting to consider raising domestic oil prices for the third time but expects to take up the issue next week, an alliance official said on Thursday. Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's 15-party alliance had been scheduled to meet this Friday to discuss a proposal to raise petroleum prices to help plug a mounting subsidy bill. \"They will be meeting on July 8,\" the alliance official told Reuters. Two earlier meetings had already been postponed, mainly because of deep disagreements over how to tackle the subsidy costs. The government owes state oil companies an estimated 155 billion rupees ($4.3 billion), and the companies have complained they cannot keep importing crude unless domestic prices are raised to bring them more in line with world prices. Coalition officials said a crisis in Gujral's Janata Dal party, the biggest group in Gujral's 15-party coalition, was the main reason behind the most recent postponement. The party was holding an election on Thursday to choose a leader, but a faction backing the indicted party chief, Laloo Prasad Yadav, was boycotting the poll. Yadav, who is chief minister of the eastern state of Bihar, and 55 others have been indicted by federal police in a $280 million corruption case involving the alleged embezzlement of state animal husbandry funds. Yadav says he is innocent. India's communists are vigorously opposed to any price increase, while Gujral and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram have argued for moderate price rises in some petroleum products coupled with the eventual dismantling of state controls. The Communist Party of India wants customs and excise duties on oil scrapped and has submitted an alternative plan to avoid higher petroleum prices, which it says would hurt the poor. Several newspapers have said the United Front, worried that mid-term elections may become inevitable, was growing increasingly reluctant to raise oil prices. Any increase in petroleum product prices would be the second by the United Front in its one year in power. Last July the government raised the price of petrol by 25 percent and the prices of high-speed diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking, paraffin wax and fuel oil by 30 percent. It was forced to scale back the rise in diesel prices to 15 percent after nationwide protests supported by left-wing parties. ($1 = 35.8 rupees)\n",

      "U.S. realtor sees int'l interest in HK property. Hong Kong's soaring property prices are deterring international investors from buying here, but the territory's China link and moderating prices should ensure future interest, a U.S. realtor said on Friday. \"Prices are quite high right now so it is hard for us to attract U.S. investors or Japanese investors, but times change,\" Richard Mandel, managing director Asia of U.S. real estate firm Kennedy-Wilson Inc told Reuters in an interview. \"Hong Kong is really the financial centre for China.\" Kennedy-Wilson formed a joint venture company earlier this month with local firm Goldman Property Consultants Ltd. As well as marketing international properties to Asian buyers, Kennedy-Goldman (HK) Ltd will deal with office sales and leasing and residential sales in Hong Kong. \"The reason companies come to Hong Kong is because of the China factor. Hong Kong is still a financial centre and they need to have Hong Kong as a stepping stone to capture the China market,\" Kennedy-Goldman managing director Raymond Fung said. Mandel said Hong Kong property prices were likely to remain at a premium to other cities in Asia, but companies would still chose to build operations here. \"They obviously believe that the productivity in Hong Kong will more than compensate for the higher costs.\" Residential property prices surged by about 30 percent during the first six months of this year and office capital values gained about 30 percent in the last quarter of 1996. Fung said office prices had held strong until about March, but government moves to curb speculation and rising real estate prices had cooled sentiment. He said residential prices had dropped 10 percent since Hong Kong's new government announced plans to increase housing supply earlier this month and were expected to drop another 10 percent ahead of a government policy statement in October. \"I think residential prices will grow more steadily in the future,\" said Fung. He said while limited supply in core locations would keep Grade-A office prices buoyant, increased supply in other areas would dampen Grade-B office prices. \"Demand will be strong because a number of PRC (People's Republic of China) companies will be coming,\" said Fung. \"In the coming 12 months prices will increase 10-20 percent in the core locations, but I am quite pessimistic about tertiary location office prices. They could be down around five to 10 percent for Grade-B office space,\" he added. -- Hong Kong newsroom (852) 2843 6345\n",

      "UN begins food handouts in Sierra Leone. The United Nations World Food Programme said on Friday it had begun distributing food in Sierra Leone because stocks of essentials had dwindled since the military coup on May 25. The food, from existing stocks that had mostly escaped looting after the coup, will be distributed in Freetown and other urban centres. The WFP was already helping feed people in hospitals, schools and orphanages there, but it said in a statement issued by its regional office in Ivory Coast that thousands more had arrived in the towns in need of help. The WFP said the price of staple foods had doubled since the coup, and supplies of imports such as rice, sugar and flour had fallen. \"Kerosene and petrol are also in short supply, and it is expected that many essential products such as fuel and rice will run out within two weeks,\" it added.\n",

      "FEATURE-Ousted general sets sights on Colombia presidency. Tough-talking Gen. Harold Bedoya is putting his unceremonious dismissal as Colombia's armed forces chief behind him and pushing for promotion -- to the presidency. In an interview with Reuters, he outlined his fledgling plans for what he termed a \"popular and national\" government that would grant more powers to the state and could curtail individual rights of citizens in a bid to crush the country's powerful leftist guerrilla groups. Bedoya, 58, hinted that if he is elected in May 1998 he would seek to introduce sweeping changes that could extend his period in office or even open the way to his re-election. Under the present constitution a president serves for a non-renewable four-year term. \"I will be a good president. ... Mine will be a national movement that represents all Colombians, rich and poor,\" he said in his impromptu campaign office in northern Bogota. \"It will be a government that seeks to recover national dignity and values based around the fundamental nucleus of the nation, which is the family.\" But the square-jawed military hawk rejected suggestions he wanted to create an authoritarian, populist and nationalist government, saying he would rule without \"distinction of class or ideology\" in a way that would be \"popular for everybody.\" Bedoya headed the military for just 8-1/2 months before a series of public disagreements over President Ernesto Samper's plans to launch new talks to end Colombia's three-decade rebel uprising ended in his firing in late July. LITTLE SUCCESS FOR MILITARY IN POLITICS The army has little history of direct involvement in politics and retired officers who, like Bedoya, have ventured into the political arena have been obliterated by a system where regional power-brokers guarantee block votes for the traditional Liberal and Conservative parties in return for a wide array of favours and kickbacks. But in three early polls, the ousted general, due to formally register his presidential candidacy in the next few weeks, is already emerging as a leading contender, with about 40 percent of voter support. That puts him level or even ahead of his main rivals, former Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, widely seen as Samper's straw man, and former Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso, seen by many as a puppet of Washington. Bedoya enjoys support from the right wings of both the ruling Liberal and opposition Conservative parties and has a gaggle of high-profile female admirers, including top models, actresses and the director of the National Theatre. A central plank of his platform, still on the drawing board, is likely to be a blueprint for the military defeat of the rebel armies, now embarked on one of their bloodiest offensives in years. Bedoya, who was trained at the U.S. School of the Americas and has been accused by human rights group of sponsoring right-wing death squads, has firmly resisted Samper's plans for no-holds-barred talks with the rebels. \"I want those who commit crimes to have to respond for them ... the state cannot afford to be weakened by handing over territory or sovereignty (to the guerrillas),\" he said. GREATER SPENDING ON WAR EFFORT In order to blast the rebels into submission he said he would \"strengthen state institutions,\" including the armed forces -- an indication that he would earmark a greater share of the budget for the war effort even as civilian politicians demand more restraint and efficiency in defence spending. Hand-in-hand with the military strategy, Bedoya contemplates the wider use of emergency powers to give security forces more clout in their anti-guerrilla campaign. Political analysts charge such a move could polarise the country if individual rights are partially suspended by curfews, temporary imposition of martial law and appointment of military rulers in areas dominated by the guerrillas. Under the guise of fortifying state institutions, the general also hinted that once in office he may engineer what would undoubtedly be a highly controversial power-grab. \"(Re-election) will be a theme for discussion in the course of my government,\" he said. \"I think if Colombia sees the country is recovering then people will want to see the government prolonged. But that's a democratic process.\" Coupled with his fervent anti-guerrilla stance, Bedoya has promised a \"crusade\" against the kind of deep-rooted political corruption exposed by allegations that Samper financed his 1994 election campaign with donations from the Cali drug mob. \"The narco-scandal was a detonator but the problems had been brewing for 10 or 15 years,\" he said. In comments sure to be welcomed by U.S. anti-drug agents, with whom he enjoys warm personal relations, he said he would push hard for drug cartel capos to be extradited to stand trial in U.S. courts and is open to the possibility of reopening investigations into Samper's role in the drug-funding scandal. Bedoya still seems ill-at-ease in a jacket and tie after 42 years in uniform, but he is confident the same charisma that won him wide respect in the ranks as a soldier's soldier will translate into votes for the nation's top job.\n",

      "OPTIONS - UK equity traders wait for U.S. data. UK equity options traders were not taking any chances and many decided not trade in case of being wrong-footed ahead of the U.S. employment report on Friday, dealers said. \"The figures have a habit of producing surprises and people have decided it wasn't worth taking any additional risk (in the options market),\" one dealer said. In stock options Reuters Holdings and British Petroleum attracted the larger deals whereas volatility trades were popular in the European style FTSE 100 index options. Dealers believed the spike up in shares of news and information company Reuters prompted one trader to roll forward a long put position. The deal was to sell 400 April 600 puts at 22p in a closing deal and to buy 400 July 550 puts at 16p in a new opening position. By 1215 GMT, Reuters shares were up 11-1/2p to 588p. On the bull tack, over in BP, one large deal was to buy 500 October 800 calls at 12p and in a separate deal, there was a seller of 250 July 650 puts at 19p. BP shares fell 8p to 675-1/2p. The main volatility trades in FTSE were from traders expecting near-term market volatility to decrease and so they sold strangles which were hedged by FTSE futures. In one such deal 250 April 4225 puts and calls in Euro-FTSE were sold for a net credit of 102p against June FTSE futures at 4251. By 1215 GMT, spot FTSE was up 25.0 at 4239.6 while June futures were up 21 at 4258. -- Pradip Mishra, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7954\n",

Fire chiefs ordered the evacuation of about 300 people from the Holiday Inn hotel and the bank after a road construction crew punctured a high-pressure natural gas line and winds blew the fumes towards the hotel. A pregnant woman was among six people sent to a hospital and another six received medical treatment at the scene. \"They were complaining of light-headedness, dizziness and nausea,\" Fort Worth Fire Department spokesman Steve Kerr said. \"It was nothing life-threatening but we wanted to play it safe, especially with the pregnant lady.\" A spokesman for Lone Star Gas said the leak was sealed within an hour and the danger had passed. Hotel guests were allowed back to their rooms after fire crews checked the building for pockets of trapped gas.\n",

      "Kmart improved sales boost second-quarter profits. Kmart Corp., the nation's third-largest retailer, Thursday reported a 35 percent rise in second-quarter operating profits and surprisingly strong earnings, crediting higher sales in most merchandise categories. Net income from continuing operations rose to $31 million, or 6 cents a share, from $23 million, or 5 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter, the Troy, Mich.-based company said. Overall net income fell to $31 million, or 6 cents a share, from $34 million, or 5 cents a share, in the 1996 period because Kmart sold its struggling Builders Square home improvement chain to investment bank Leonard Green & Partners LP in July. Builders Square accounted for $11 million in profits a year ago. But the profit topped Wall Street's consensus forecast for 4 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analyst estimates. Kmart stock rose 31 cents to $12.06 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the most actively traded shares on volume of 2.4 million. Kmart rang up $7.85 billion in total sales, a 3.7 percent increase from $7.57 billion in 1996's second quarter. Comparable-store sales -- by stores open at least a year -- increased 5.5 percent. \"Sales in our U.S. Kmart stores increased 5.6 percent on a comparable store basis for the first six months of 1996, which meets our expectations,\" Chairman Floyd Hall said in a statement. \"Strong sales also helped expense ratios,\" he said. Sales of housewares and home decor, cosmetics and fragrances, and consumables -- quick-turnover items such as soft drinks, snacks and socks -- showed strength, said Hall. Kmart has been disappointed by sales of women's apparel this year, but the company is entering the third quarter with seasonal inventory levels below last year's and expects improvements in the second half, Hall said in a statement. For the first half, Kmart's income from continuing operations was $45 million, or 9 cents a share, vs. a loss of $13 million, or 2 cents a share last year. First-half net income was $45 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $65 million, or 13 cents a share, in 1996. Sales rose to $15.1 billion from $14.5 billion. Kmart, which operates 2,122 Kmart, Big Kmart and Super Kmart retail outlets, is the third-largest U.S. retailer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Co.\n",

      "Black Baptist leader reaffirmed despite scandal. The president of one of the nation's largest black denominations was given a vote of confidence on Thursday by leaders of the group, despite being embroiled in a messy sex-and-money scandal. The Rev. Henry Lyons, president of the Nashville-based National Baptist Convention USA Inc., was given a \"unanimous vote of confidence\" by about 200 of the group's leading members, the group announced. Lyons' wife, Deborah, was charged earlier this month with setting several small fires in a $700,000 home her husband owned with Bernice Edwards, a woman convicted in 1994 of embezzling federal education funds. According to court records, the National Baptist Convention helped pay restitution that Edwards owed. Police said Deborah Lyons set the fires, then crashed her car into a palm tree. She said she was angered after discovering the joint deed to the house while Lyons was on a trip to Nigeria with Edwards. She is free on $10,000 bond and has pleaded not guilty to arson and burglary charges. Lyons has since reunited with his wife, and has publicly denied cheating on her or using church funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. He reportedly owns a Rolls-Royce and two Mercedes automobiles as well as the house with Edwards.\n",

      "Dismal Q1 gold results hit Kloof, others. Dismal first quarter results knocked Kloof Gold Mining Co Ltd to a new year low on Thursday and analysts and dealers said this did not bode well for other gold mining shares. Kloof fell to 31.75 rand per share from its previous 32.90 rand close before climbing back to 32.00 rand. \"I would think this would be very worrying for other gold shares,\" said Nick Goodwin, analyst at Fedsure Asset Management. Dealers said there had already been some negative reaction from mining shares not in the Gold Fields stable. Kloof halved its March quarter pre-capex profit to 54.63 million rand. Parent Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd declared first quarter profit of 236.42 million rand -- a severe drop from its preceding quarter's 333.08 million rand. But Gold Fields itself remained unmoved, not trading all day except for one trade of 200,000 shares shortly after its results which held the share steady at 108 rand. Driefontein Consolidated fell 45 cents to 40.80 rand after it posted a fall in profit to 182.02 million rand from 214.09 million rand. -- Melanie Cheary, Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482-1003\n",

      "World cobalt supply seen healthy despite Zaire. The world's cobalt supplies will remain healthy, regardless of whether Zaire develops its cobalt projects, Peter Searle, head of U.K.-based Resource Strategies said at a conference on Thursday. \"There should be more than enough for the next three or four years from existing and committed supply sources if Gecamines continues production,\" Searle said in a presentation to cobalt industry representatives. \"If it does not, the market will move much closer to balance once again.\" Fresh instability in Zaire had given new momentum to planned projects outside of Africa, particularly the lateritic nickel deposits in Australia, he said. Searle was speaking at a conference organised by the Cobalt Development Institute in Hong Kong. He estimated that in 1996 around 12,000 tonnes of low grade material was processed -- 9,000 tonnes from primary sources and around 3,000 tonnes from scrap and residue. He said there was a resistance point of around US$15 per pound as this price was required to ensure a supply of cobalt through the processing of intermediate and low grade material. But Searle estimated that if all possible projects materialised, there could be a surplus of cobalt shortly after 2000. \"I think a price of $6 per pound or even lower is possible but at this price risk may deter some future projects. The probability is that our forecast oversupply will not occur in its entirety,\" he said, noting that prices were likely to stay well above $6 per pound. On Wednesday, cobalt was quoted at $24.25/25.25 per pound for cathodes and $21.75/22.75 per pound for ingots. Zaire projects had attracted substantial investment interest, Searle said, adding that beneath political turmoil lay vast tailing deposits that could be developed into very low cost copper and cobalt operations. \"We estimate that over US$200 million of equity has so far been raised for their development and several feasibility studies for projects are underway,\" he said. Worldwide cobalt consumption in 1996 was 23,500 tonnes, Searle estimated. Searle said he believed supply fell slightly in 1995 and that in 1996 both Western production and supply were similar to 1990 levels when supply reached an all-time high. \"These two factors, I believe, explain the recent price trends,\" he said. -- Mishi Saran (852) 2843 6358\n",

      "Belgian franc wins vote of confidence, OLOs shine. The Belgian franc appeared to have put an end on Wednesday to its recent slide which pushed the currency to well above its 20.6255 ERM midpoint, dealers said. \"There is a consensus that 20.64 is not so bad after all and since everything is quiet on the political front, it should soon return to its midpoint,\" one trader said. At 1405 GMT, the franc was at 20.6395/00 to the mark against 20.6410/20 late on Tuesday. Dealers said the franc had not affected short-term rates. \"So bonds certainly stayed out of trouble,\" one said. OLOs built further on early gains in line with Bunds with the 10-year OLO yielding 5.78 percent against 5.81 percent in early business and 5.83 percent at the close on Tuesday. The OLO/Bund yield premium was at 10 basis points against 11 on Tuesday. Dealers noted some trading in OLOs 26 (2007) and 14 (2004) and a flurry of buying interest in the short end in OLOs 11, 13 and 21 (maturing in 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively). But they noted that overall business remained slack and feared that once again, key U.S. data due later this week would fail to revive spirits and trade. The market's next target is Thursday's U.S. CPI, seen at 2.6 percent. \"It looks though that there will be nothing new under the sun, it's been like this for the past two months now,\" one trader said. -- Bert Lauwers, Brussels Newsroom +32 2 287 6815, Fax +32 2 230 7710\n",

As a result, Osmium this week was forced to tell Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi Spa (ENI) -- the giant Italian state owned energy group that owns the smelter -- that it would not be able to meet a end-July deadline to buy the facility. \"It is a great disappointment...but Osmium are still greatly committed to the whole project,\" he added in a telephone interview. \"If the deal can get back on track before the end of this year, then there's a possibility to renegotiate an arrangement with ENI,\" Irons said. Osmium had a memorandum of understanding with ENI to buy the smelter, which included an end-July deadline. Under the plan the 100,000-tonne per year Italian facility, owned by ENI-unit Pertusola Sud SpA, was to have been closed for conversion sometime next year. The metals market has been closely following the progress of the deal, since the closure would remove supply of zinc, a star performer this year on the London Metal Exchange (LME). Three-month zinc prices this week surged to a 6-3/4 year high of $1,507 per tonne on the LME, up from $1,057 at the beginning of the year. Osmium last year signed agreements with Norilsk to process 11 million tonnes of low-grade concentrate in Russia, from tailings dams which collect residues, then ship the higher-grade concentrate to Italy for refining. But a change in management at Norilsk led to a series of renegotiations, which culminated in Norilsk recently saying they were not in a position to proceed because they wished to determine whether they could process the tailings themselves. The review by Norilsk is expected to take two to three months. \"Hopefully there will be further discussions with Norilsk in due time, but nothing is going to happen until they complete their review,\" Irons said. \"Osmium does have legally binding agreements to take the tailings from two dams,\" he added. But Osmium was not currently considering taking legal action against Norilsk. \"I think that is an issue that is yet not being considered,\" Irons said. Osmium's investors include Mark Jones III, chairman of Crown Resources Corp. SBC Warburgs are the financial advisers for the project, Irons said.\n",

      "Germany's Genscher pans 3.0 pct deficit aims-paper. Former German foreign affairs minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a signatory of the Maastricht Treaty, said on in an interview on Friday a strict reading of the monetary union deficit was at odds with the treaty itself. \"Those who pretend that there is a 3.0 percent written in the Maastricht treaty are not respecting its terms,\" he was quoted as saying in an interview with daily Le Figaro. \"The fathers of this treaty were people more competent in economics and finance than the politicians who claim the title of apostles of stability and want to change the treaty by reinterpreting it,\" he said. By establishing \"criteria that do not exist, (they) are sapping confidence in the stability of the future currency\", he said. Genscher also warned that \"a controlled delay (of EMU) would quickly lead to an uncontrollable collapse of the single market and thus of European integration adding that the Bundesbank was right in qualifying this discussion about the number behind the decimal point as a 'phantom debate'.\" He criticised repeated German reprimands directed at other European Union members and said it was perfectly legitimate to add social aspects to the Maastricht monetary criteria, without calling it a \"scandal\". \"We started with the Italians, the Spanish and other people from the south, now it is the turn of the French to be used as scapegoats\", he said. \"This is how with an incredible irresponsibility we are playing a game of questioning one of the most precious assets gained from our post-war economic policy. \"I am telling you that France will be part of EMU and that your new government will do everything to fulfil the terms of the treaty, but not those added afterwards by a few German politicians,\" he said. -- Paris Newsroom 331 4221 5452\n",

      "British manufacturing rebounds, services soften. British manufacturing output rebounded in June but the services sector, the main engine of the country's economic boom, grew at a slightly slower rate in July, data on Tuesday showed. Economists said the figures did not significantly alter the background for this week's meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, but the slight softening in services could allow the committee to delay any further interest rate rises. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent in June after an unexpected fall of one percent in May, and was up 1.2 percent year-on-year. Overall industrial production was up 1.4 percent in June, way above market forecasts of a 0.5 percent rise, and expanded 1.9 percent year-on-year. Separately, the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said in its July survey on the services sector that the strong pound was starting to hurt service providers as well as manufacturers. Its monthly survey, sponsored by Reuters, showed the service sector continued to grow strongly but at a less vigorous pace than in recent months. Jonathan Loynes, an economist at HSBC, said the strength in overall industrial production reflected a rebound in both energy extraction and supply, but the picture in manufacturing remained weak. \"With the latest survey evidence giving clear evidence that the strength of the pound is hurting, there is a real risk of a further fall in output in the third quarter, putting manufacturing technically back into recession,\" he said. Loynes said he expected the monetary policy committee to concentrate more on the strength of services and raise interest rates for the fourth time in as many months. Official interest rates are now at 6.75 percent. However, David Coleman of CIBC Wood Gundy said the PMI survey showed trade in services was not immune to the damaging effect of the strong pound. \"As time goes on, there are also likely to be spill-over effects from a slowdown in manufacturing,\" he said. \"If this survey does indeed herald the start of a period of more subdued growth in services, then some of the more pessimistic forecasts for UK interest rates could well prove misplaced.\"\n",

      "Growth slowing but inflation risks remain - Rivlin. By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent The economy is slowing down from its exuberant first quarter pace, but still faces the risk of higher inflation down the road, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Alice Rivlin said on Monday. \"We certainly have clearer signs that the economy is slowing, but we still have a tight labor market,\" she told Reuters in an interview. That means that the central bank will again face a \"tough call\" next month in deciding whether to raise interest rates further, she said. \"If the Fed believes that inflation is a serious risk, then it should, in the interests of sustaining growth, tighten,\" Rivlin said. \"It's just at the moment that's not crystal clear.\" After increasing rates in March to keep the economy from overheating and to head off inflation, the Fed held policy steady at its last meeting in May amid hopes growth would slow. The central bank next meets to plot monetary strategy on July 1-2 and Wall Street analysts are betting it will once again opt to keep rates unchanged. Rivlin said that she did not think that the economic picture has changed all that much over the last few months. While growth is slowing, it is not certain whether it is slowing enough to contain inflation or how long the slowdown will last, she said. And labor markets remain \"very tight,\" raising the risk of big wage hikes and higher inflation. \"We still have these two things going on at once,\" Rivlin said. \"We have an economy which is really slowing and we still have inflation risk. It could be that way for months.\" Rivlin confessed that the current economic situation was \"quite mystifying\" but nevertheless welcome. At 4.8 percent, the U.S. unemployment rate is at levels that in the past have led to stepped-up wage increases and higher inflation. But that has not happened this time. \"We have an inflation risk without inflation,\" she said. She noted that many companies continue to report having trouble raising prices because of stiff competition from domestic and foreign rivals. Besides the tight labor market, Rivlin pointed to the ebullient stock market as another area of possible concern. \"You have to be quite optimistic about (corporate) earnings to justify these kinds of (share) prices,\" she said. But she noted, \"Earnings have been doing quite well.\" With stock prices so high, there is a risk investors will respond by sharply stepping up their purchases of consumer goods, spurring growth too much and fanning inflation. \"We haven't actually seen that,\" Rivlin said. But that could still occur in the future, she added. The Fed policymaker was generally upbeat about the longer-term economic outlook and saw no reason to worry about the economy falling into recession. Although retail sales have ebbed in recent months, consumer confidence is very strong, personal incomes are rising and employment is high, she said. \"It looks like a very strong economy,\" Rivlin said. \"The main risk is inflation.\" ((--202 898-8370))\n",

      "INTERVIEW - Tie Rack trading \"satisfactory\". International tie retailer Tie Rack Plc said on Thursday that recent trading has been satisfactory, but noted that the strength of sterling was continuing to pressure its overseas earnings. With over 400 shops in 28 countries around the world the strength of the pound had an adverse impact on sales and profits of Tie Rack's overseas earners during its last quarter but it still managed to lift year profits 11 percent. \"Overall it could have a half to one percent effect on our overall growth margin (if sterling maintains current levels). But we still expect profitable growth in the year,\" chief executive Nigel McGinley told Reuters in an interview. Earlier the group announced that pretax profits for the year to February 2, 1997, had risen 11 percent to 8.79 million stg. It raised its total dividend to 3.35p from 2.75p. The company described trading in the first two months of the current year as \"generally satisfactory\". McGinley said the company, with nearly 60 percent of its shops now overseas, was a little cautious on Europe given the depressed economic conditions in many European countries at present, but said that Europe would remain its main area of development for shop openings. The company, however, is taking a cautious view of expansion in the UK given the current trend to higher rentals in the property market. It remained confident that it would continue to make good progress in the U.S. and Far East. It has already opened 12 shops this year and expects shop numbers to grow by around 10 percent this year with growth predominantly overseas. It recently branched out into Eastern Europe for the first time when it opened in the Czech Republic. - Andrew Young London Newsroom +44 171 542 4019\n",

      "Boetsch says Bonn mulling fast Telekom sale. German postal minister Wolfgang Boetsch said on Wednesday the government was considering plans to quickly sell its stake in Deutsche Telekom AG. Boetsch told a news conference in Bonn that the government, which holds a 74 percent stake, was looking at different ways to further privatise Telekom including \"unloading the whole package\" on a strategic partner. Boetch declined to comment on reports attributed to coalition sources that Boetsch and Finance Minister Theo Waigel want to sell 287 million of the government's 2.03 billion shares on the bourse this year. Boetsch said it was not yet clear which model would be used. He said a change in laws would be necessary to float Telekom shares this year. He said approval for that from the Telekom management board would not be required. Boetsch said that the government would keep the interests of small shareholders in mind when making its decision. The government originally planned to keep its 74 percent stake in Telekom until 2000. A Telekom spokesman said that the government can only sell its shares before the year 2000 in a way that would not affect capital markets. Government sources on Tuesday said Bonn was considering selling 287 million shares this year and the remainder by the end of 1998. Telekom confirmed the company was holding talks with the finance ministry. Boetsch added that how state-owned shares in the German telephone monopoly would be sold had not yet been decided, but he was looking at three options: -- A bourse flotation, which would not require legislation. -- The sale of shares to a strategic partner. -- The disposal of the state's entire stake. Bonn still controls nearly three-quarters of Telekom after last November's privatisation of a 26 percent stake, which raised 20 billion marks ($11.7 billion). ($ = 1.702 German Marks)\n",

      "Larger trade gap offers perilous cure for UK boom. Balance of payments problems are usually the stuff of politicians' nightmares, but Britain's new Labour government may actually be pinning its hopes on a worsening in the trade position. Analysts say a wider balance of payments deficit could help to slow strong and potentially inflationary economic growth, and quash the pound's exuberance, which has inflicted serious pain on exporters. \"Seldom have Treasury forecasts been so dependent on a deterioration in net trade in goods and the pound,\" Yamaichi chief economist John Shepperd said. \"The government must be sitting around saying \"good grief, we hope the current account gets worse and the pound falls.\" Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Gordon Brown predicted on Wednesday that Britain would post a current account deficit of 6.0 billion pounds ($10.1 billion) in 1997, increasing to 9.0 billion in 1998. By contrast, the deficit in 1996 was just 500 million pounds. Britain is still a long way from the balance of payments' crises which dogged it during the 1980s boom. But relying on a fall in exports to pull the economy back down to a steady \"trend\" growth of 2.5 percent next year from the official forecast of 3.25 for this year is nevertheless fraught with danger. \"What we're likely to get is the opposite of what the economy actually needs,\" CIBC chief economist David Coleman said. \"We're going to get another squeeze on exporters when what we actually need is less consumer demand.\" So far British exports have held up remarkably well in the face of an overall surge in the pound of 20 percent -- 30 percent against the deutschemark alone -- but analysts say the export picture will change next year. \"The impact of the depreciation in the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar took around 18 months to filter through to trade and we're probably looking at a similar timescale for sterling,\" Coleman said. Sterling began to rocket in August last year. Wednesday's budget gave it another fillip by fuelling speculation that interest rates would have to rise to curb domestic demand as the bulk of tax increases were aimed at the corporate rather than the buoyant consumer sector. At the moment, markets pay no attention to British trade data both because they have conspicuously failed to show a clear trend and because they are simply not fashionable as an economic indicator. But sentiment towards economic indicators is notoriously fickle -- yesterday's \"wallflower\" is often tomorrow's belle of the ball. \"No-one really wants to know about trade at the moment but I think it's set to become much more of an issue,\" HSBC UK economist Jonathan Loynes said. Soaring trade deficits tend eventually to lead to losses of confidence in currencies and Britain has a particularly sad history in this respect. Worries over a deterioration in the balance of payments in 1976 led to a sterling crisis under the last Labour government, ousted in 1979. Some commentators believe the sterling crisis was ultimately responsible for the party's subsequent 18 years in opposition, which only ended in May this year. At present the prospect of higher interest rates is continuing to lure investors into the pound. Many economists expect the Bank of England, newly empowered by Brown to determine monetary policy, to increase Britain's 6.5 percent interest rates by up to 1/2 percentage point next week to check inflationary pressures. But once the perception is that interest rates have peaked, the pound is likely to come under pressure. Britain's productivity has improved, but not by enough to weather such a sharp appreciation in the pound, analysts say. \"The chances of a sterling crisis further down the line have certainly increased after the budget,\" HSBC's Loynes said. While Brown said that his budget would help to address the imbalance in the economy between the sluggish export sector on one side and the robust service and consumer sector on the other, analysts believe he may have actually worsened the situation. A steady deterioration in the trade position will gradually throw up worries over other economic measures such as inflation and the strength of consumer demand, especially as millions of Britons will receive 30 billion pounds' worth of free shares as mutually owned building societies turn themselves into banks. \"The government is almost relying on the trade deficit to deteriorate as a pressure valve, but this doesn't seem to be the safest way of cooling the economy,\" Loynes said. --London newsroom +44 171 542 5109 ($ = 0.592 British Pounds)\n",

The Liverpool house where Beatle Paul McCartney wrote his first songs and where the \"Fab Four\" practised is to be restored to 1960s style and opened to the public. The National Trust, which in 1995 bought the terraced house where McCartney lived from the age of 13 until the Beatles became famous, said on Wednesday it had received a 47,500 pound ($77,700) grant from Britain's national lottery fund to turn the house into a mini-museum. \"The history of 20 Forthlin Road has had a tremendous impact on 20th century popular culture,\" said National Trust spokesman Peter Nixon. \"The grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund has ensured that the house can open to the public in 1998 and that visitors can share in the significance of this exciting time in the history of popular music.\" The National Trust is to use photographs taken by McCartney's family at the time to recreate the decor of the 1955-1964 period. The low cost rented house will have the original doors put back and a 1950s fireplace restored. Opening times, however, will be restricted to 127 days a year and amplified music has been banned.\n",

      "S.African farmers, miners complain about rain. Abnormal weather in South Africa has flooded a desert, blocked roads with snow and delayed harvesting of maize crops, government and agriculture officials said on Tuesday. Japie Grobler, chairman of the National Association of Maize Producers (NAMPO), told reporters rain and snow in the eastern Free State in recent days would further delay harvesting of maize by up to two weeks and would force farmers to postpone planting winter wheat. \"The maize crop doesn't dry in this weather. The sun is shining today, but we need wind to dry the crop. We're hoping for some dry air,\" Grobler said. He said artificial drying facilities were running at 100 percent capacity but could not meet demand and some exporters were getting anxious at the delay in getting the crop out of the fields. \"It's a big problem. In Reitz and Bethlehem, wheat farmers say it will be three to four weeks before they can get into their fields to plant.\" Maize farmers in North West province also reported excessive moisture in their crop, Grobler said. Piet Grobler, marketing manager at agricultural co-operative Sentraal Oos based in the Bethlehem area, told Reuters that more snowfalls and wet weather were forecast for later this week. \"This will delay the harvest more,\" he said. The Namakwaland semi-desert region of Northern Cape province had some of its heaviest rains since 1925, with one area recording in one week the amount of rain it received in an average year. Floods washed away roads near the town of Springbok, isolating the 600 people of a hamlet called Kommagas, local government officials said. Air force helicopters ferried food to the town. The Kleinzee diamond mine on the Namakwaland Atlantic coast, owned by De Beers Consolidated, has lost two days of production because of the floods, a spokesman said. The areas affected treat an average of 375,000 tonnes of ore a month. In KwaZulu-Natal province, snow blocked some roads in mountainous areas, police said. --Cape Town newsroom +2721 252238\n",

      "Russia to sell 40 pct of Tyumen Oil Company. Russia is holding an investment tender for 40 percent of Tyumenskaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya (TNK) (Tyumen Oil), the Federal Property Fund said on Tuesday. The minimum investment is $160 million over two years, fund spokesman Vladimir Yefimchik told Reuters. Bids must be received by July 16 and the results will be decided on July 18. Banks and foreign investors are not eligible to bid. The fixed price for the 40 percent stake, which comprises 632.66 million shares, each with a face value of five roubles, is 145 billion roubles ($25 million). TNK's pre-tax profit fell to 200.6 billion roubles on a Russian accounts accruals basis in 1996 from 486.6 billion in 1995. Sales rose to 14.27 trillion roubles from 11.99 trillion. Production fell to 21.30 million tonnes from 22.57 million. TNK is one of a dozen vertically integrated Russian oil groups created over the last few years. Its main operating unit is Nizhnevartovskneftegaz  NZGZ.RTS. The Russian government holds 99.98 percent of TNK. Former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik is board chairman both of TNK and of the Central Fuel Company, which is based in Moscow. --Aleksandras Budrys, Moscow Newsroom, +7095 941 8520\n",

      "Austrian civil servants strike over cost-cutting. Thousands of Austrian civil servants staged a half-day strike on Tuesday in protest against job cuts and a spending freeze by the government. Some 10,000 finance ministry officials went into work but refused to pick up telephones. The action was supported by customs officials who were not directly involved in the strike. \"The strike is not against the population but a warning to employers,\" Public Service Union (GOeD) head Siegfried Dohr told state television. The strike began at midnight and was expected to end at midday on Tuesday. It is the first by public sector workers since a 24-hour protest in 1990. Austrian civil servants, protected from redundancy by law and relatively well-off in comparison with other public sectors in Europe, have recently become unhappy about government cost-cutting measures. They say staff numbers have been reduced and pay packets eroded by cuts aimed at ensuring Austria qualifies for a single European currency. Many civil servants received no pay increase this year as part of the government's austerity drive. In a season of protests opposition parties are also boycotting parliament until June 10 to try to force an inquiry into the 1989 slaying of Kurdish dissidents in Vienna by suspected Iranian assassins.\n",

      "Yugoslavia welcomes EU move, vows more reforms. Yugoslavia welcomed special trade privileges granted by the European Union on Tuesday and said the deal would help it to speed up economic reforms. \"This is really great news, even though it was expected. It is a recognition of positive changes in Yugoslavia by the EU ministers and we see their decision as support to continue with reforms,\" Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Danko Djunic, told Reuters. The European Union granted special trade privileges to Yugoslavia but warned that lack of democratic progress or backtracking from the Dayton peace agreement would lead to their withdrawal. The trade benefits -- which include offering duty-free access and eliminating quantitative restrictions on industrial products -- were also needed to help the country's struggling economy, the EU statement said. \"I hope that the EU move, by which it gave us some carrot but kept waiving a long, heavy stick, will be productive, because we shall speed up reforms, privatisation, liberalisation of our trade regime and development of the local financial market,\" Djunic said. \"The decision also has a great psychological importance both home and abroad and gives hope that Yugoslavia will be integrated and accepted as an equal member of the international community,\" Djunic added. The deputy prime minister, in charge of overall economic reforms, said it was too early to estimate full effects of the granted trade benefits. \"Those privileges give us a chance to enter competition on the EU market on an equal footing. They will help Yugoslav export industries revive and return to their traditional export markets,\" Djunic said. The EU said it expected the Milosevic government to begin talks with the opposition parties, make more improvements to its media laws, reform its electoral law and judicial system, and make \"susbtantial progress\" on the issue of Kosovo. \"In the absence of progress...towards meeting these criteria the decision on granting autonomous trade preferences will be reviewed,\" the EU statement said.\n",

      "Zaireans block aid delivery to Rwandan Hutu camps. Hundreds of angry Zaireans stopped aid workers reaching teeming Rwandan Hutu refugee camps on Friday, posing new problems for a delayed U.N. repatriation plan, witnesses said. The demonstrators prevented an aid convoy from disembarking a Zaire river ferry, attacking vehicles and threatening aid workers in a protest over the refugees and the aid they receive. The demonstrators told Reuters the refugees should move deeper into the jungle away from Kisangani, Zaire's third city. They said they did not want Western aid workers crossing the river. \"The Zairean population refuses to let the whites (aid officials) take food to the refugees because the refugees are killing local Zaireans,\" said Yenga Masomboye, a boat operator. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said the incident was a setback but that it hoped to get into the camp soon. The United Nations delayed an operation set to start on Friday to repatriate the first batch of 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees after rebel officials expressed fear that it could spread cholera in the region. \"We are optimistic that they (regional authorities) will conclude that this is safe to do and that we will be able to start on Saturday,\" UNHCR regional spokesman Paul Stromberg told reporters in Kisangani on Thursday. A total of 330 cholera cases and 19 cholera deaths have been recorded at Kasese refugee camp, 25 km (16 miles) south of Kisangani, according to U.N. figures. Around 100,000 sick and exhausted Rwandan refugees arrived near a railway line south of Kisangani last month begging to go home after a five-month trek through the jungle. Rebels of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, led by Laurent kabila, control nearly half of Zaire after a six-month campaign to oust ailing president Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruler since 1965. The rebels say armed Hutus among the refugees from the former Rwandan government army and extremist Interahamwe militia who played a leading role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide pose a grave security threat. Newly elected governor Yagi Sitolo told Reuters he feared cholera could spread if refugees were brought to Kisangani airport for the flight home. Senior aid officials planned to meet regional authorities on Friday in an effort to convince them the repatriation posed no threat, Stromberg said. U.N. agencies and non-governmental organisations are nursing the refugees back to health and UNHCR has devised a multi-million dollar plan to take the refugees on trucks, planes and barges across the Zaire river back to Rwanda. Eighty healthy but unaccompanied Rwandan children were to be flown to the eastern town of Goma on Friday at the start of the opeation. More than a million Hutu refugees fled eastern Zaire camps at the start of the rebel campaign. Most returned to Rwanda in November but hundreds of thousands more fled deeper into Zaire.\n",

      "High Court urged to uphold insider-trading law. A Justice Department lawyer urged the Supreme Court Wednesday to uphold one of the federal government's toughest enforcement weapons in fighting insider-trading abuses. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben asked the high court to rule in favour of the government's interpretation of a section of the securities law that makes it a crime for a person to use confidential information in securities trading. Under the theory, if an individual misappropriates secret information and trades on it, it is illegal because the person has breached a trust or duty, even if the individual is not a traditional company insider. The arguments involved a U.S. appeals court ruling that overturned the conviction of James O'Hagan, a Minneapolis lawyer whose firm had been retained by London-based Grand Metropolitan Plc in connection with its 1988 takeover of Pillsbury Co. He was convicted of using secret information about the deal to reap a $4.3 million profit in Pillsbury stock and stock options. O'Hagan was sentenced to 41 months in prison. The U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis reversed his conviction last year on the grounds that he had not violated any fiduciary duty to Pillsbury stockholders. But Dreeben argued that O'Hagan had breached a duty to his law firm, posing as a loyal partner while using confidential information entrusted to the firm to reap huge profits for his personal gain. \"Information is the lifeblood of the securities market. The deceptive acquisition and use of such information serves no legitimate purpose,\" he said. \"Investors rely on the fact that the markets are essentially honest.\" In reply to a question from Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Dreeben admitted the law would not apply to someone who stole a lawyer's briefcase and traded on the information. He said that the thief would not breach any duty to the law firm. \"There are forms of improper conduct that section 10b (the provision of the law at issue) does not reach,\" he said. \"This is in essence a crime that involves surreptitious activities,\" Dreeben said. \"This is a unique type of fraud, unique to the securities market.\" The law has been used by the government in a number of high-profile cases against people who were not considered company insiders. Those cases include a printer of secret tender offer documents, a psychiatrist who learned from a patient of a takeover bid and former Wall Street Journal reporter, R. Foster Winans, who leaked confidential information before it appeared in a widely read stocks column. John French, a Minneapolis lawyer representing O'Hagan, said the law has \"sown confusion.\" He said the conviction should have been overturned because \"the relevant information was in the public domain\" at the time of trades. In any case, he said Congress since the 1980s has failed to clarify the reach of the law. \"The Congress, if it wants to get the misappropriations theory into law, has to write it into law,\" he said. \"Congress has not enacted it.\" After the hour-long arguments, the Supreme Court took the case under advisement, with a ruling expected by July.\n",

      "Czech PM sees '97 c/a deficit at 7 pct of GDP. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the ballooning trade deficit should slow, lowering the current account deficit to about seven percent of gross domestic product. \"The deficit of the current account will decline from 8.2 percent of GDP (for 1996) to something around seven percent for the year 1997,\" Klaus said in an address to the Zofin Forum of Czech business leaders. The Czech crown came under strong downward pressure in May, due to, in part, the country's huge trade deficit. Some private economists have estimated the 1997 current account deficit at between eight percent and more than 11 percent of GDP. Klaus, an economics professor, said he agreed with most of the new economic forecasts released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday, but was sceptical about the upper range of its forecast for economic growth of 2.0-3.0 percent in 1997. \"I would be a little bit more cautious (than three percent),\" Klaus said. \"In many respects we can agree with yesterday's relatively optimistic prognosis of the CSU\" The CSU said that while many economists expected a possible recession in 1997 after a contraction in industrial production earlier in the first quarter, that it still saw industrial output growing by a real 2.4 to 4.5 percent this year. The CSU said on Monday, the current account deficit would equal 6.7-7.3 percent this year. The central bank was forced to float the currency on May 27, and raised key interest rates to fight off speculators and counter the effects of a more than 10 percent fall in the currency. The crown has since recovered much of the losses since it was floated. The government followed the central bank measures with its second austerity package of budget cuts in as many months, in an effort to cut domestic demand which had been driving the trade deficit. Klaus said the economic recovery depended on \"political stability, persuading the market about the exchange rate of the crown, holding back aggregate demand and slowing imbalances through fiscal restrictions but also by not overshooting monetary restrictions.\" Klaus had been critical of central bank steps to tighten monetary policy last year, blaming it for the slow down in economic growth. He later agreed with the centre-right coalition government to back a tighter monetary policy as part of the emergency economic measures adopted in late May. -- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 420-2-2423-0003\n",

      "Blair to Kohl - reform your economy for EMU's sake. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Europe's youngest prime minister, flew into Bonn on Friday with firm but polite advice for Europe's elder statesman, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl: modernise your economy if you want the single currency to work. Fresh from warning Europe's centre-left parties at a congress in Sweden of the need to ditch outdated economic ideas, Blair was due to deliver a similar message to Kohl in their first face-to-face talks. To make sure his point got across to German voters, Blair said the same in a front-page commentary in the country's most popular newspaper, the mass circulation Bild daily. Speaking to reporters during his flight from a European socialist party meeting in Malmo in southern Sweden, Blair said: \"In order to make the single market work and certainly if Europe proceeds towards a single currncy, you have got to have the economies in proper shape. \"That means flexible labour makets, investment in education and skills and ensuring that we're developing the type of welfare state that is compatible with what is a completely different set of economic conditions today.\" Aides said Blair won strong support for his ideas during bilateral meetings in Malmo with the prime ministers of Sweden and Denmark but was under no illusion that it would take time to convince Germany of the need to reform. Commentators in Germany sometimes say Blair is to the right of Kohl, whose Christian Democratic Union (CDU) supports a \"social market economy\" with elements of intervention that look more like traditional social democratic policy that New Labour. \"I think we are building support for a genuine new third way in Europe, which means the role of government is not old-style state intervention or heaping regulations on employers -- but neither is it the way of conservative parties of simply letting people sink or swim in the market place,\" Blair said. \"The new way is about education, skills, new technology, developing small busnesses and equipping people to survive in a completely different set of economic conditions. \"I believe there is a lot of support for that right across Europe,\" Blair said. Asked whether the single currency risked becoming a potentially disastrous irrelevance, Blair -- who says it is highly unlikely Britain will join monetary union (EMU) at the start -- said it was up to Germany to decide whether it wanted to press ahead with the project. \"If the single currency is fudged or the criteria for it are fiddled, or we don't take the measures of reform that we are suggesting in Europe... then there will be problems,\" he said. Blair said it was up to each country to decide whether to sign up for EMU. \"But all countries have got a common interest in making sure we reform the economies of Europe to make us more competitive for the future,\" he said.\n",

      "Mexico summons NY Times journalist over drug story. Mexican authorities summoned a New York Times journalist for questioning on Friday in a criminal investigation over a story alleging two Mexican governors were linked to the drug trade. The journalist, Sam Dillon, the Times' Mexico bureau chief, co-authored the Feb. 23 article based on U.S. intelligence reports. The article said U.S. agents have linked Morelos state Gov. Jorge Carrillo Olea and Sonora state Gov. Manilo Fabio Beltrones to drug trafficking. The two governors, who have strongly denied any drug ties, have asked prosecutors to bring charges against Dillon. Dillon has not been charged with any crime. In Mexico if a person is charged with defamation they can face up to two years in jail. \"We consider this law and this complaint attacks the rights of all journalists\", Dillon told reporters. \"The story is truthful. It was written in a very objective way\". Dillon's co-author, a U.S.-based colleague, Craig Pyes, lives outside Mexico. Dillon said the Times' four-month investigation for the story was based largely on documents from a U.S. intelligence centre in El Paso, Texas, that is run by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and coordinates intelligence reports from several different cities.\n",

      "Polish officials differ over privatisation list. Polish government officials appeared to be at odds on Wednesday over a list of large state-owned firms, shares of which are to be sold to finance a crucial reform of the country's ailing social security system. The cabinet minister in charge of the reform, Jerzy Hausner, wants to have the list ready quickly, while the treasury minister, preparing the list, is in no hurry to present it, Hausner and his top aide said on Wednesday. \"We would like this list to be created as soon as possible... Work on the list is carried out in the treasury ministry,\" Michal Rutkowski, director of Hausner's office, told a news conference. Hausner later told Reuters that Treasury Minister Miroslaw Pietrewicz, known to share his Peasant party's generally cautious attitude towards privatisation, was reluctant to quickly unveil the list because this might arouse controversy. @ \"I can't tell you when the list will be ready. In my view if we had the list, this would give the (pension reform) programme a higher profile, but the minister (Pietrewicz) thinks there is still time for this,\" Hausner said. \"The minister thinks this (the list) might result in disquiet,\" he said without elaborating. Neither Pietrewicz nor his spokesman was immediately available to comment. Since the fall of communism in 1989, privatisation has always been a political minefield, notably at election time. @ The current campaign for parliamentary polls, scheduled around September, is no exception, with the opposition Solidarity Electoral Action (AWS) stepping up its criticism of the pension reform and privatisation plans of the government coalition of ex-communists and the Peasant party. Under the government's pension reform scheme, the finance ministry is to issue bonds, convertible into shares of the companies from the list, if the national budget cannot bear the costs of the reform in any other way. The costs stemming from the creation of new pension funds, are estimated at about one percent of Poland's gross domestic product annually for more than 20 years from the date of the reform's launch, possibly in 1999. GDP is forecast at 430 billion zlotys in 1997. Government officials have said that the list of companies -- which is to be appended to three pension reform bills due to be discussed by parliament on Thursday -- would be made up of 60-70 firms with good financial results. A statement by Hausner's office, issued on Wednesday, confirmed that the list was likely to include such large firms as copper combine KGHM Polska Miedz SA, telecoms monopoly TPSA, Bank Handlowy SA, farming bank BGZ SA, air carrier LOT SA, fuels distributor CPN SA, the Plock oil refinery, gas and oil firm PGNiG and tourism agency Orbis SA. Rutkowski said it would be up to the government to decide each year how much of these companies would be sold, either directly or through convertible bonds, to finance the reform. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700\n",

      "Forex loans raise concern at Bank of Israel. Bank of Israel Supervisor of Banks Zeev Abeles on Sunday expressed concern about the growing trend of taking out loans linked to foreign currency. He said it exposes those taking such loans to risks in devaluations. \"I think the banks have to check very thoroughly the ability to repay loans and the sources of repayment of customers who ask for foreign currency credit and to make more stringent the requirements and collateral required for this type of credit,\" Abeles said at a news conference. \"I expect the banks to act with caution and responsibility because the realisation of this risk could call in to question the ability of these customers to repay their debts and consequently roll over the risk and the losses to the banks.\" The supervisor of banks department is following the situation closely and examining its implications for the stability of the banks. \"If we see that the banks are exposing themselves to too much risk in this area we intend to intervene,\" he said, adding that the banks were being looked at individually. High domestic interest rates in the past two years have increased the attractiveness of such loans. Foreign currency linked credit grew from $6.5 billion at the end of 1994 to $14.7 billion at end of 1996 and to $16.8 billion at the end of the first quarter of 1997. The share of foreign currency linked credit in total bank credit increased from 14 percent in 1994 to 24.2 percent in 1996 and 29 percent at the end of the first quarter of 1997. The main recipients were the construction, food and financial services industries. Abeles also expressed concern about the rise in the banks' operating costs, mainly labour-related costs due to special programmes to encourage early retirement. From 1990 to 1996 operational costs grew 25 percent or 3.8 percent a year while labour costs alone grew 4.3 percent a year or 29 percent. Abeles also cautioned that many factors that contributed to the banks' profits in 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 were short-term factors. High interest rates, for example, led companies to take foreign currency loans and investors to switch from provident funds to savings accounts. A weak capital market forced companies to seek out bank financing since they could not raise money on the bourse. An economic slowdown will take its toll on the banks later in the year, he said. Abeles said there has been a decline in interest from foreign banks in opening branches in Israel because of the geopolitical situation but he would not elaborate. -Jerusalem newsroom, 972-3-537-0502\n",

      "HSBC eyes gold market as treasury expands. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp (HSBC) plans to boost its presence in the Hong Kong gold market as part of its treasury expansion, the bank's treasury chief said on Friday. \"The focus we are starting to put on our bullion business is consistent with the continued upgrade of our capabilities in all treasury products,\" Michael Hillier, head of foreign exchange and institutional sales at HSBC Markets, told Reuters. HSBC Markets, the treasury arm of HSBC, hired an experienced gold trader last month to boost HSBC's profile in the bullion market, Hillier said. UK-based Midland Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings and well established in the bullion market, would support the department in their efforts, Hillier said. \"If we are successful in attracting new business, then we will probably be involved in the (bullion) market place a little bit more aggressively than we are now,\" Hillier said. Hillier said China offered a great deal of potential for all treasury products, noting that HSBC expected to make inroads in China's bullion markets as well. Gold traders in Hong Kong welcomed the move, noting that Midland would forge a link it lacked in the global gold trade. \"Anybody who is big in the business has to be here,\" said a senior gold source. Several firms have withdrawn from Hong Kong's gold market over the past year, restructuring their operations in a moribund bullion environment. -- Mishi Saran (852) 2843 6358\n",

      "Pakistani province bans fireworks after explosion. The government of Pakistan's Sindh province banned fireworks on Sunday, a day after a store of firecrackers blew up, killing two people, wounding 19 and damaging six houses in the southern port city of Karachi. The two-month ban on fireworks and the storage of explosive materials was imposed after Saturday's blast, which Deputy Inspector General of Police Malik Iqbal said had been caused by exploding firecrackers, not by a bomb as earlier thought. He told a news conference firecrackers weighing a total of 40 kg (88 pounds) had blown up in the Saudabad area of District East. Another 43,344 Indian-made firecrackers, weighing 75 kg (165 pounds), had been recovered from a nearby house. Iqbal said police were looking for the owner, identified only as Rajan, of the house where the explosion took place.\n",

Bulgaria posted a current account deficit of $22.3 million last year after a $25.6 million deficit in 1995, preliminary Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) figures showed.

Banks reported exports of $4,752.7 million and imports of $4,664.9 million in 1996, the BNB said. Exports fell 11.6 percent year-on-year in 1996 while imports decreased by 12.4 percent. The fall in exports was due to lower foreign demand, a fall in local industrial output, high interest rates, restructuring of the industrial and financial sectors and rising energy prices, the BNB said. Sales to the European Union (EU) member countries had the largest share in Bulgaria's exports at 36.5 percent. Slower GDP growth rate of those countries last year was the main reason for the falling demand for Bulgarian goods, the BNB said. The 1996 GDP growth rate of the EU was estimated at 1.6 percent against 2.5 percent in 1995. Bulgarian exports also suffered from bank closures and liquidation or financial isolation of loss-making state enterprises in line with a funding agreement with the international Monetary Fund signed in mid-1996. Imports fell mainly due to the sharp depreciation of the lev currency against the dollar and declining purchasing power of companies and individuals. The Bulgarian lev fell to around 500 per dollar at the end of last year from around 71 at the beginning. The BNB central interest rate rose to record high of 300 percent annually in September from 34 percent in January. Consumer price cumulative inflation for last year was 311 percent. The sharp lev fall failed to boost Bulgaria's exports as around 61 percent of the cost of Bulgarian industrial products depends on imported raw materials, the BNB said.

      "India group to fight tobacco sports sponsorship. A leading Indian health organisation said on Saturday it will step up a campaign this year against tobacco companies' sponsorship of sporting events. An estimated 800,000 to one million people die in India due to tobacco-related diseases every year, the Voluntary Health Association of India (VHAI), a non-governmental body, said in a statement. India is the world's third largest tobacco producer. About 85 percent of the output is consumed in the domestic market. \"This year, to commemorate World No-Tobacco Day (May 31), VHAI will not merely continue its earlier initiative in the area but will also focus on its major concerns,\" VHAI's head of public policy, Mira Shiva, said. The statement said a key concern was \"misuse of sports and cultural events for the promotion of these hazardous products through surrogate advertisements.\" Tobacco advertisement is banned on Indian television but activists say sports sponsorships or promotion of cigarette brands by the sale of sports gear or other goods bearing familiar tobacco trademarks promote smoking. Last year, anti-tobacco activists mounted a protest against the sponsorship of the World Cup in cricket held in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka by cigarette-maker ITC Ltd through its Wills brand. Britain's new Labour government earlier this month announced it was banning sponsorship of sporting events by tobacco companies, hitting hard some of the country's tournaments, including leading cricket trophies. \"Tobacco sponsorship of sports creates subconscious positive images of the relationship between smoking and existing activities,\" VHAI said. Shiva said VHAI was also concerned about the impact of passive smoking on women and children and continued smoking in public places, public transport and work places. In January this year, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) government in Delhi banned smoking in government offices, educational institutions, hospitals, cinemas, restaurants and public transport. But the state government's rules are difficult to enforce. Many areas in the federal capital, New Delhi, technically fall outside the writ of Delhi's state government as they come under the federal authorities.\n",

      "Indian businessmen offer 50 pct freedom discounts. Indian businessmen are doing what they can do best. They are offering 50 percent discounts to customers to mark the 50th anniversary of independence from Britain. \"Be a part of celebrations at Hotel Siddarth, New Delhi,\" an advertisement by Jaypee Hotels said in the Times of India newspaper on Thursday. \"A fabulous 50 percent discount awaits you on rooms, food and beverage from the stroke of Midnight, 14 August 1997 to 17th August, 97,\" it said. India won independence on August 15, 1947. Mobile phone firm Escotel announced a 50 percent cut in tariffs in Harayana state. Retailer Inter Craft Ltd offered 50 percent cuts at its Inter Shoppe outlets. Banaras House said it will sell silk sarees at half the usual price. Some companies, however, are playing on the number five instead of offering 50 percent cuts. Computer-maker HCL offered a five-year warranty on computers bought before August 25. Computer education firm Aptech Ltd invited students to save 5,100 rupees ($143) in course fees. The Indian affiliate of Britain's Cadbury Schweppes has planned to release 50,000 special bottles of its soft drink, Canada Dry, disguised like champagne bottles packed in golden wrappers. But angry members of parliament frothed and fizzed on Wednesday after hearing unconfirmed reports that entertainer Lata Mangeshkar, who is scheduled to sing a national song in parliament at a special midnight session, would uncork a bottle on the occasion. An opposition deputy said the Indian way to mark such an occasion would be the breaking of a coconut, not the popping of a bottle of some Western drink. Cadbury Schweppes India said in a statement on Thursday that Mangeshkar had autographed the bottles, but the endorsement did not mean that the singer would uncork the special bottle. \"There was never any intent or mention in any...publicity material of uncorking of Canada Dry Freedom Salvo in parliament by Lata Mangeshkar or any other person at any stage during the independence day celebrations,\" it said.

      "Calif. resident believed to be world's oldest person. Christian Mortensen, aged 114, was quick to see the implication when told on Monday that the world's oldest person, a 122-year-old Frenchwoman, had died. \"He simply said: 'Well then I guess that makes me the oldest person in the world',\" JoAnne Maxwell, administrator of the northern California retirement home where Mortensen lives, said. The Danish-born Mortensen is believed to be the world's oldest person following the death of Jeanne Calment in Arles, France, on Monday. Maxwell, administrator of the Aldersly Garden retirement community in San Rafael, 10 miles (15 km) north of San Francisco, said Mortensen could not talk to a reporter on the telephone because he was hard of hearing. She said Mortensen was told of Calment's death by a nurse at the retirement home, where he has lived since 1978. Mortensen, born in Skaarup, Denmark in 1882, came to the United States in 1903, working as a tailor, milkman and streetcar repair man. He is due to celebrate his 115th birthday  Aug. 16. Maxwell said Mortensen was \"doing pretty well\". He usually gets around by wheelchair because walking wears him out, but he does sometimes walk, she said. He has a \"wonderful sense of humour\" and \"just enjoys life,\" she added. Maxwell said Mortensen probably attributes his longevity to his lifestyle. He drinks a lot of bottled water, does not drink alcohol but enjoys the occasional cigar, Maxwell said. Demographers at the University of California at Berkeley said in 1995 that Mortensen was the oldest man alive whose age they could verify. At that time, Calment outdid him as the oldest person in the world.\n",
