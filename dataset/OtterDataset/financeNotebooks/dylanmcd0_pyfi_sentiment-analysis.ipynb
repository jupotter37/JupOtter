      "Summary: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) trimmed its stake in Apple (AAPL) by over 50% at the beginning of August. Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: \"Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there.\" He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is \"finding places to play,\" but ultimately is \"waiting for better valuation.\" Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

CNET editor-at-large Bridget Carey joins Wealth! to talk about the best consumer tech deals ahead of the Labor Day Weekend and as retailers shift focus farther down the road to the holiday season. While you may want to upgrade some of your tech, Carey advises consumers to be cautious about Apple (AAPL): \"There's going to be an Apple event soon, just two weeks. Apple is going to be revealing new gadgets, and so I would say if you're going for like a brand new phone, no. But it's a great time for a sale if you don't care about having the newest stuff because retailers have to sell their inventory, so they're going to discount all the current earbuds and the other gear like old phones.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

Forte notes a specific challenge facing Apple this year: while the company will introduce new hardware in its latest iPhone upgrade cycle, consumers will need to wait for the updates related to Apple's artificial intelligence software dubbed \"Apple Intelligence.\" Forte explains this could potentially delay sales for the tech giant in the near term as consumers might hesitate to purchase new devices until the software is released.

      "Summary: Apple (AAPL) has announced new succession plans, with longtime CFO Luca Maestri set to be replaced by the company's current Vice President of Financial Planning. Kevan Parekh, will assume the CFO role effective January 1, 2025. Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Morning Brief to discuss the implications of this change on the tech giant. Forte commends Maestri's ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, expecting Parekh to continue this approach. However, he notes that Parekh's main challenge will be navigating ongoing antitrust lawsuits. \"These are challenging times for Apple on multiple fronts,\" Forte explains, citing increased regulation, EU scrutiny, and growing competition in China. Despite the succession, he expects \"the overall strategy to remain.\" While acknowledging the significance of this leadership change, Forte believes \"the bigger question\" is when Apple will change its CEO. He describes Tim Cook as \"the posterchild\" type of CEO that follows a founder, suggesting his eventual succession will have more substantial implications for investors.

      "Summary: Apple (AAPL) is set to hold its upcoming iPhone 16 launch event on Monday, September 9, debuting not only the next generation of smartphones but new Apple Watches and AirPods as well. Could this new tech help breathe new life into Apple shares? TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Market Domination to discuss Apple's upcoming tech event, what it means for the tech giant in its future quarters and into 2025, and whether an iPhone upgrade cycle can reinvigorate the stock. \"I think this will do okay. People are not excited anymore about iPhone upgrades for the most part because they all look the same, and they're pretty similar. It's hard to tell recent generations apart and eventually, I think, Apple will eventually do a foldable [phone] as we've seen with Samsung (005930.KS) and with Google (GOOG, GOOGL),\" O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance. \"But, in the meantime, I think they'll do okay. But that focus again is going to be on the software much more than the hardware this time around.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
