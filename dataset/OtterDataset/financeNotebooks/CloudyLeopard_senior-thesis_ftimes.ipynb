      "The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and signalled more reductions would follow, launching its first easing cycle since the onset of the pandemic.\n",
      "The US central bank’s first cut in more than four years leaves the federal funds rate at a range of 4.75 per cent to 5 per cent. Michelle Bowman, a governor on the Federal Open Market Committee, voted against the decision, favouring a quarter-point reduction.\n",
      "The half-point cut is larger than the Fed’s more customary quarter-point pace and suggests the US central bank is concerned about the prospects of a weakening economy after more than a year of holding rates at a 23-year high.\n",

      "Lauren Fedor in Washington\n",
      "Donald Trump said the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, saying the move showed the economy was either “very bad” or the central bank was “playing politics”.\n",
      "“I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming that they are not just playing politics,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday afternoon at a stop at a Manhattan bitcoin bar. “The economy would be very bad, or they are playing politics, one or the other. But it was a big cut”.\n",
      "Trump’s comments came hours before he was set to take the stage for a campaign rally in the New York City suburbs, on Long Island.\n",

      "Voter registration among swing states and young electors surged on National Voter Registration Day as early voting begins in some states.\n",
      "The non-profit Vote.org says it signed up more than 150,000 new voters on Tuesday, a record total, with 16 per cent hailing from swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n",
      "Voters under the age of 35, a critical demographic for Kamala Harris’s campaign, accounted for 81 per cent of sign-ups, while the number of 18-year-olds registered rose 53 per cent compared with 2020.\n",
      "The organisation said 81 per cent of sign-ups typically turn out to vote.\n",
      "Lauren Fedor in Washington\n",
      "US vice-president Kamala Harris has called the Federal Reserve’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point “welcome news for Americans who have borne the brunt of high prices”.\n",
      "In a statement shortly after the Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday, the Democratic presidential candidate added that her focus remained “on the work ahead to bring prices down”.\n",
      "With less than two months to go until November’s presidential election, opinion polls suggest that the majority of voters remain deeply concerned about inflation and the cost of living, even as the inflation rate has slowed in recent months. The latest FT-Michigan Ross poll found four in five voters cited price increases as among their biggest sources of financial stress.\n",

      "US stocks closed lower, even as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by an extra-large 0.5 percentage points as inflation cooled and the labour market softens.\n",
      "The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both fell 0.3 per cent. Every sector in the S&P except energy fell, and four of the Magnificent Seven tech groups declined. The Russell 2000 index of US small-cap stocks was flat.\n",
      "The release of the Fed decision, which had captured the attention of market participants for weeks, could allow investors to refocus on the quality of equities, rather than the macroeconomic factors that can affect performance.\n",
      "“When the market has been focused on fundamentals, it’s rallied,” said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “When we get to macro, it’s struggled more”.\n",
      "Treasuries sold off on the day. The 10-year bond yield rose 0.06 percentage points to 3.7 per cent.\n",
      "Steff Chávez in Washington\n",
      "The White House said the US was not involved in the walkie talkie incidents in Lebanon on Wednesday but declined to provide any more information, including whether it assesses that Israel was behind the attacks.“We were not involved in yesterday’s incidents or today’s in any way, and I don’t have anything more to share,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.He added that it is “too soon to know what these incidents are going to mean to the already high tensions between Israel and Hizbollah up at that [Lebanese-Israeli] border”.When asked about Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant’s Wednesday comment about the start of a new phase in the conflict, Kirby reiterated the US position that Washington wanted to see the war end and continued to believe there was a diplomatic path forward.\n",
      "Taylor Nicole Rogers in New York\n",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said it will not endorse Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, a blow for the US vice-president, who has secured the support of other American unions.\n",
      "The decision came after polls of the union’s 1.3mn members, which include UPS drivers, railroad workers and nurses, found that 58 per cent wanted the union to endorse former president Trump. The union said on Wednesday that 31 per cent backed Harris.\n",
      "Other major US unions, including the United Auto Workers, AFL-CIO, United Steelworkers and the American Federation of Teachers endorsed Harris soon after she launched her campaign.\n",
      "Colby Smith in Washington and Nicholas Megaw in New York\n",
      "Most Fed rate-setters expect the central bank to lower the federal funds rate by an additional 0.5 percentage points by the end of 2024.\n",
      "In the latest “dot plot” of officials’ forecasts, most expected the policy rate would fall to 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent by the end of 2024, suggesting another large half-point reduction at either of the two remaining meetings this year or two quarter-point reductions.\n",
      "Overall, that is a significantly larger reduction than the quarter-point cut projected by most officials in June, when the dot plot was last updated.\n",
      "Two of the 19 officials who pencilled in estimates thought the Fed should hold off after Wednesday’s reduction, while another seven forecast only one more quarter-point cut this year.\n",

      "The short-dated debt instrument’s yield fell to 3.56 per cent, 0.1 percentage points lower than its position right before the rate decision was published. Two-year yields were up on the day before the Fed decision. A sell-off in the benchmark 10-year Treasury moderated.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the price of gold hit a record high of $2,599.92 per troy ounce. The yellow metal, which does not produce a yield, typically becomes more attractive to investors as interest rates decline.\n",

      "Adrian Wojnarowski, a journalist for Disney’s ESPN who revolutionised sports reporting in the digital age through his use of social media, is retiring from the profession.\n",
      "Wojnarowski, known mononymously as Woj, was among the highest-profile ESPN employees known for breaking the news of virtually every transaction in professional basketball on X, where he has 6.5mn followers. Wojnarowski reshaped the role of the modern sports reporter as a deal-breaking machine rather than a postgame feature writer.\n",
      "His exclusives, in turn, directed traffic to ESPN’s cable programming, helping to underpin discourse on shows such as First Take and NBA on ESPN. Before joining ESPN in 2017, he spent more than a decade at Yahoo News.\n",
      "ESPN chair Jimmy Pitaro said in a statement that Wojnarowski “led the industry at ESPN” and that his “work ethic is second to none”.\n",

      "Joshua Bolten, Business Roundtable chief executive, said the data marks “the second consecutive quarter in which CEOs have reported they are moderating their hiring plans — though with fewer than 30 per cent indicating they plan to decrease hiring”.\n",
      "The lobby group’s chair, Chuck Robbins, who is also chair and CEO of Cisco, added that chief executive expectations for capital spending were positive, with a “majority” of chief executives indicating “they plan to maintain or increase capex in the near term”.\n",

      "The boost to Gray’s pay, first reported by the BBC on Wednesday, means she is paid more than any Cabinet minister or her predecessor. It is likely to worsen existing resentment among a raft of Labour special advisers over their pay and contracts.\n",
