      " Read full articleInsider MonkeyJim Cramer Says You Should Hold On To Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)Attiya ZainibTue, Jul 30, 2024, 4:47 AM5 min readLink Copied0In this article: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August. Since Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.Earlier this month, Jim Cramer during his program on CNBC talked about the importance of optimism right now and explained why he sees hope for America in the future.Cramer said that the recent political violence made things look “dark” and “grim.” The CNBC host said this election year has been a “mess, something very much in sync with the tone of the country.”However, Cramer referred to the recent comments from the CEO of the world’s largest investment manager, and said it seems the end of the world is “not on the table.” Cramer called the executive’s comments a “breath of fresh air” and agreed with the notion that the US economy needs more growth and less business regulation. Cramer said that America has a huge deficit problem but it cannot tax its way out of this.“But we can grow our way out of it.”Cramer said we should understand that capitalism is a “force for good, a force for wealth generation, not just for the rich, but for everybody, as long as they invest.”Jim Cramer urged his viewers to invest in individual stocks.“I don’t care what you invest in, as long as you invest.”For this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he’s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) Among Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August?Pixabay/Public DomainSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 154Jim Cramer said in a latest program that Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a “hold” here and he’d own the stock. Cramer said he sold some Salesforce shares when they were higher for his charitable trust.According to Yahoo Finance data, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is expected to see earnings growth of about 16% on a per-annum basis over the next five years. Data also shows the company is expected to deliver double-digit YoY EPS growth in the next ten out of eleven quarters.While Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is primarily a customer relationship software company, with notable tools and platforms like Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack, its most promising platform is Data Cloud when it comes to AI and software. The platform has 90% year-over-year growth and clocking in $400 million in FY2024. What does this platform do? It helps organizations process data from various departments and third-party cloud solutions. Powered by an AI-driven data engine, it analyzes metadata in real-time to provide valuable insights, supporting sales, marketing, and customer service workflows.Story continuesAs of the end of Q1 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) had $17.7 billion in cash and low financial leverage.Mizuho Securities analyst Gregg Moskowitz thinks the company is still “well situated” to help customers in digital transformation. However, the analyst thinks Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM) would do so by prioritizing profitable growth. The analyst reiterated his Buy rating on the stock but cut his price target to $300 from $345.Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who has an Overweight rating and a $320 price target on Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), said that Salesforce’s PEG ratio of 1.2 shows the market is not pricing in operational discipline and earnings growth sustainability.“We continue to view GenAI as a tailwind for Salesforce, with benefits likely coming in CY25, but at these levels, GenAI represents a call option.”Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) declined nearly 20% due to a slowdown in revenue and bookings growth, part of a wider trend we’ve observed across enterprise software as companies defer spending on large projects given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. As mentioned, there has been an emerging narrative about prioritized spending on AI, cloud, and security over enterprise software spending that could eventually impair seat-based software over the longer term. Though there may be some near-term shifts in dollars toward GenAI, we believe the market for mission-critical enterprise software will remain robust well into the future. We will monitor the position closely, but we continue to believe that Salesforce is well-placed with its mission-critical software and high customer retention rates to weather these headwinds, lean on pricing power, and effectively monetize generative AI in its product suite.”Overall, Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Jim Cramer’s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Calls Before August. While we acknowledge the potential of Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.READ NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.Disclosure: None.

      "I have gathered the income statement data for Salesforce, which indicates a significant improvement in earnings per share (EPS) and net income. However, there are also noteworthy insider selling activities, particularly from high-ranking executives, which can reflect their sentiment about the stock's future performance. I will analyze both the financial performance and insider transactions to provide a comprehensive perspective on market sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer:\n",
      "Salesforce's recent financial performance appears robust, with a notable increase in earnings per share (EPS) rising to $4.20 for the latest reporting period, compared to just $0.21 a year ago. This substantial growth reflects the company's ability to generate profit efficiently, which is a positive indicator for investor sentiment. Additionally, net income from continuing operations has surged to approximately $4.14 billion, up from $208 million last year, showcasing a strong operational performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the outlook is tempered by significant insider selling activities. Recent transactions reveal that several top executives, including CEO Marc Benioff and President Brian Millham, have sold substantial amounts of their shares. For instance, Benioff has executed multiple sales, disposing of 15,000 shares at prices ranging between $232.63 and $286.67, which raises questions about their confidence in the stock's near-term performance. Insider selling can often be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's trajectory, especially when carried out by high-ranking officials.\n",

      "While the financial metrics suggest a cautiously optimistic outlook, the insider selling may indicate that these executives are securing profits, possibly anticipating market volatility or a correction. This mixed sentiment could lead to fluctuations in the stock's performance in the short term.\n",
      "\n",

      "Final Answer: In evaluating Salesforce's stock performance amidst current market sentiment and recent developments, several critical factors must be considered, including the partnership expansion, positive endorsements from influential analysts like Jim Cramer, and the mixed signals from technical and financial analyses.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Partnership Expansion**: The recent news regarding Salesforce's partnership expansion is a positive indicator. This suggests potential for revenue growth and increased market penetration, which can bolster investor confidence. Partnerships often lead to enhanced product offerings and customer reach, positioning Salesforce favorably in a competitive landscape. If this expansion leads to measurable growth in sales or user adoption, we could see an uptick in stock performance as the market begins to value Salesforce’s future potential more highly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analyst Recommendations**: Jim Cramer’s positive outlook on Salesforce is noteworthy. His influence can sway retail investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. If his recommendations are based on strong fundamentals and future growth prospects, this could attract more institutional investors as well, further supporting the stock price. However, it’s essential to monitor how these recommendations translate into actual trading volumes and price movements in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technical Analysis**: The technical indicators showing resistance and support levels provide critical insights. If Salesforce’s stock is approaching a resistance level, it may struggle to break through without significant new buying interest. Conversely, if it holds above established support levels, it suggests a foundation for potential price appreciation. Traders will be closely watching these levels to gauge market sentiment and potential breakout scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Financial Analysis**: While the earnings per share (EPS) indicates strong performance, significant insider selling raises concerns. Insider selling can signal a lack of confidence from those closest to the company, which might deter some investors. However, it’s crucial to contextualize this selling—insiders may sell for various reasons unrelated to the company’s performance, such as personal financial needs or portfolio diversification. If the earnings growth continues alongside strategic initiatives, the long-term sentiment may remain positive despite short-term fluctuations due to insider actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Market Sentiment**: Overall, the current market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, driven by strategic partnerships and analyst endorsements. However, the mixed signals from insider selling and technical resistance could lead to volatility in the short term. Long-term performance will largely depend on Salesforce’s ability to capitalize on its partnerships and maintain robust earnings growth while managing insider sentiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while immediate risks stemming from insider selling and technical resistance may create some volatility, the underlying fundamentals—strong EPS, partnership expansion, and positive analyst sentiment—position Salesforce favorably for future growth. If these factors align well, we could see Salesforce's stock perform positively in both the near and long term, provided it can overcome short-term resistance and investor concerns. Therefore, I recommend monitoring the stock closely for any shifts in these dynamics and adjusting our investment strategies accordingly.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "### Price Data Overview\n",
      "The historical price data for Salesforce (CRM) over the past month is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **High**: $266.08\n",
      "- **Low**: $245.72\n",
      "- **Current Price**: $253.06 (as of August 1, 2024)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Levels\n",
      "1. **Resistance Levels**:\n",
      "   - The first resistance level is at **$260.00**. This level has been tested multiple times and has held as a barrier for the stock.\n",
      "   - A secondary resistance level can be identified at **$265.40**, which was the recent high.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Support Levels**:\n",
      "   - The primary support level is around **$250.00**. This level has been observed as a strong floor where the stock price has bounced back.\n",
      "   - A secondary support level is at **$247.35**, which is close to the recent low.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Chart Patterns\n",
      "The stock has shown a fluctuating trend over the past month, with a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating potential bearish sentiment. However, the recent price action suggests a consolidation phase around the $250-$260 range. A breakout above $260 could indicate a reversal in trend, while a drop below $250 could signal further declines.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Indicators\n",
      "- **Moving Averages**: If we were to apply a simple moving average (SMA) over the past 10 days, we would likely see it hovering around the $256-$258 range. This could act as a dynamic support level.\n",
      "- **Volume Analysis**: The volume has varied throughout the month, peaking during significant price movements. A spike in volume during a breakout above $260 would confirm the strength of the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Entry Points\n",
      "- **Buy near support**: Consider entering a position around the **$250.00** support level, especially if there is a confirmation signal (like a bullish reversal pattern).\n",
      "- **Wait for breakout**: Alternatively, traders might want to wait for a confirmed breakout above **$260.00** with strong volume before entering a long position.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Market Sentiment\n",
      "Despite recent volatility and cautious market sentiment, Salesforce's expected EPS growth of 11.32% year-over-year indicates a positive outlook. However, the insider selling activities may raise some concerns regarding the near-term confidence in the stock.\n",
      "\n",

      "**Price Data Summary:**\n",
      "- **High**: $266.08\n",
      "- **Low**: $245.72\n",
      "- **Current Price**: $253.06 (latest close on 2024-08-01)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Support and Resistance Levels:**\n",
      "- **Support Level**: $250 - This level has acted as a floor in recent trading sessions and could be a potential entry point for buyers.\n",
      "- **Resistance Level**: $260 - The stock has struggled to break above this level, indicating strong selling pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Patterns:**\n",
      "- The stock has exhibited a fluctuating trend with notable price swings.\n",
      "- Recent price movements suggest the formation of a potential double bottom pattern around the support level of $250, indicating a possible bullish reversal if the price holds above this level.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technical Indicators:**\n",
      "- **Moving Averages**: A short-term moving average (e.g., 20-day MA) is currently below the price trend, indicating a bearish sentiment. A crossover above this moving average could signal a reversal.\n",
      "- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume has been relatively high during the recent decline, suggesting increased selling pressure. However, a spike in volume on upward movements could validate bullish sentiments.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Entry Points:**\n",
      "- **Buy near $250**: Given the support level, a buy order near this price could be considered, especially if there are signs of a bounce back.\n",
      "- **Wait for Breakout Above $260**: Traders might also consider waiting for a breakout above the resistance level with strong volume as a confirmation of upward momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Price Targets:**\n",
      "- If the stock breaks and closes above $260, the next target could be in the range of $265 to $270, where previous highs have been established.\n",
      "- Conversely, if the stock fails to hold above $250, it could retest the recent low around $245, which may lead to further declines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Market Sentiment:**\n",
      "- The overall market sentiment is cautious due to recent volatility, which suggests that traders should be mindful of potential risks.\n",
      "- Analysts expect an earnings per share (EPS) of $2.36 for the upcoming quarter, which may provide a catalyst for price movement depending on the actual results versus market expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Insider Selling Activities:**\n",
      "- Significant insider selling by top executives raises concerns regarding their confidence in the stock's near-term performance, which could impact investor sentiment negatively.\n",
