    "        - 1+D/S (d divident, s is stock price) - formula to normalize stock prices prior to dividend, divide by adjusted price factory. \n",

    "    - simple moving average: pick something that's tied to the stock price, e.g., standard deviation over a fixed window of time. \n",

    "    - **Fundamental Analysis**: This is a method used by investors to determine the intrinsic value of a security (like a stock) by examining related economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, including macroeconomic factors (like the overall economy and industry conditions) and company-specific factors (like financial condition and management).\n",
    "    - **Sales per Share**: This is a ratio that compares a company's total sales to its number of outstanding shares. It's calculated by dividing the total sales by the average number of shares outstanding for the period. This ratio gives investors an idea of the company's ability to generate sales per unit of shareholder ownership.\n",
    "    - **Earnings per Share**: This is a portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's calculated by dividing net income by the number of outstanding shares. EPS is an important measure of a company's profitability and is often used by investors to assess financial performance.\n",
    "    - **Dividends per Share**: This is the total dividends paid out over an entire year (including interim dividends) divided by the number of outstanding ordinary shares issued. It's a way of showing how much a company returned to shareholders through dividends.\n",
    "    - **Price to Earnings Ratio**- snapshot of a company's financial health;  This is a valuation ratio of a company's current share price compared to its per-share earnings. It's calculated as Market Value per Share divided by Earnings per Share (EPS). The P/E ratio is a simple, straightforward identifier of a stockâ€™s price tag.\n",
    "9. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\n",
    "    - **investment funds**, e.g., mutual funds, are managed investments with specific risk archetypes. \n",
    "    - **ETFs**, e.g., SPY, are less risky, and produce some growth. \n",
    "    - more cost effective than trading each stock individually, since you would usually have to pay transaction feeds for trading each stock. \n",

    "    - **compound**: In finance and investing, compounding refers to the process where the value of an investment increases because the earnings on an investment, both capital gains and interest, themselves earn interest. This is sometimes referred to as \"**interest on interest**\" or \"**compound interest**\".\n",
    "    - **additivity**:  In the context of finance, additivity refers to the property that the combined value of two or more quantities is equal to the sum of their individual values. For example, the total return from two investments is the sum of the returns from each investment.\n",
    "    - **annualized rate of return**:  This is a measure of the yearly average rate of return on an investment, which takes compounding into account. It's calculated as the geometric mean of the return per period, raised to the number of periods per year, minus one.\n",
    "    - **time additivity of log returns**: This refers to the property that the logarithm of the overall return over a certain period is equal to the sum of the logarithms of the returns for each sub-period. This property is useful for simplifying calculations involving compounded returns.\n",
    "    - **numerical stability**: In numerical analysis, an algorithm is numerically stable if small changes in the input (like rounding errors) produce small changes in the result. Numerical stability is important in finance because financial calculations often involve adding or multiplying many numbers, which can amplify rounding errors if not handled properly.\n",
    "    - **arithmetic underflow**:  This occurs when the absolute value of a very small number (close to zero) is less than the smallest value that a computer's arithmetic hardware can represent in memory. In this case, the number may be automatically replaced with zero, which can lead to incorrect results or program crashes.\n",
    "    - **central limit theroem**: sum of random variables not dependent on each other approach a normal distribution as random variables in the sum approach infinity.\n",
    "    - **Log-Normal distribution**: right skewed, matches price distribution of stocks as they have a lower bound of zero. \n"
