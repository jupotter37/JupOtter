      "Document 23: That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\n",
      "The hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\n",
      "This suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\n",
      "This argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\n",
      "Nonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\n",
      "\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\n",
      "They then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\n",
      "\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\" Mr Hsiung explained.\n",
      "Given that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\".\n",
      "The answer? \"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\"\n",
      "What is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\n",
      "The team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\n",
      "They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \"structural colour\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\n",
      "The results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\n",
      "\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\" Mr Hsiung said.\n",
      "\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\"\n",
      "So why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\n",
      "Given their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\n",
      "That is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\n",
      "\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\" Mr Hsiung said. \"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\n",
      "\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\"\n",
      "It may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\n",

      "However, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\n",
      "When she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\n",

      "In a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\n",
      "Their statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\n",
      "Karen Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\n",
      "For both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\n",

      "Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\n",
      "When I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\n",
      "Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\n",
      "At 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\n",
      "We had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\n",
      "They were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\n",
      "For Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\n",
      "He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\n",
      "He comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\n",
      "So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\n",
      "At times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\n",
      "These days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\n",
      "Tim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\n",
      "Villa have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\n",
      "But, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\n",
      "You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\n",
      "Villa's net spend over the summer was under £10m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\n",
      "They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\n",
      "I don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\n",
      "You cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\n",
      "I get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\n",
      "Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\n",
      "The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\n",
      "Like Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\n",
      "In an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\n",
      "But what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\n",
      "Sherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\n",
      "Whoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\n",
      "Because he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\n",
      "Grealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\n",
      "However good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\n",
      "When you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\n",
      "You really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\n",
      "That might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\n",
      "After trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\n",

      "Diamonds, brought to the Earth's surface in violent eruptions of deep volcanic rocks called kimberlites, provide a tantalising window into the deep Earth.\n",
      "A research team led by Prof Graham Pearson of the University of Alberta, Canada, studied a diamond from a 100-million-year-old kimberlite found in Juina, Brazil, as part of a wider project.\n",
      "They noticed that it contained a mineral, ringwoodite, that is only thought to form between 410km and 660km beneath the Earth's surface, showing just how deep some diamonds originate.\n",
      "While ringwoodite has previously been found in meteorites, this is the first time a terrestrial ringwoodite has been seen. But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\n",
      "While this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\n",
      "Dr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\"\n",
      "The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\n",
      "Discussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\n",
      "\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\"\n",
      "Describing his diamond sample, he said: \"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\"\n",
      "Prof Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\n",
      "He said: \"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\n",
      "\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\"\n",
      "A key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\n",
      "Ringwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\n",
      "Grains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\n",

      "It's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n",
      "\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\n",
      "For four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\n",
      "Cotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\n",
      "He's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\n",
      "He has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\n",
      "Cotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\n",
      "I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n",
      "\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\n",
      "He tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n",
      "\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n",
      "\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n",
      "\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\n",
      "Years later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\n",
      "Eight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\n",
      "In 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\n",
      "Clermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n",
      "\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n",
      "\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n",
      "\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n",
      "\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n",
      "\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n",
      "\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\n",
      "In Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\n",
      "Media playback is not supported on this device\n",
      "Scotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n",
      "\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n",
      "\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n",
      "\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n",
      "\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\n",
      "Media playback is not supported on this device\n",
      "On the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n",
      "\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n",
      "\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\n",
      "Beyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n",
      "\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\n",
      "Five more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\n",
      "When the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\n",
      "He would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\n",
      "Will he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n",
      "\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\n",
      "Cotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n",
      "\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n",
      "\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n",
      "\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n",
      "\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\n",
