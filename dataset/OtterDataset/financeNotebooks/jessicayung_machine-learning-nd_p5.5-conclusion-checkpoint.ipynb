    "\n",
    "In this project, we predicted BP's stock price. Initially we used a linear regression only on BP stock prices from the past 7 days, which produced impressive results, with 7-day predictions having a root mean squared percentage error of 5.4%.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Difficult Aspects of the Project\n",
    "1. It was hard **selecting the algorithm** to use for this problem. \n",
    "    - It seemed as though any regression algorithm could work - and there are so many of them! I dealt with this by (1) first implementing an SVM regression to get the code to implement the algorithm down on the page so things would feel more concrete. Then I (2) chose the simplest algorithm that seemed to fit the problem and tried that.\n",
    "    - I was also conflicted as to whether or not I should use reinforcement learning. On the one hand there are profits that can act as rewards, but on the other hand trading would not impact the environment.\n",
    "2. **Putting different features together** in a dataframe took effort. \n",
    "    - Pandas `.iloc` kept throwing errors at me. \n",
    "    - Different stocks or indices had data for different dates (e.g. some had data for 1984-04-20, some didn't). I had to find these differences and decide what to do with missing data. \n",
    "3. There were **many possible features**. \n",
    "    - The project just got longer and longer and I hadn't even looked through half of the features I wanted to investigate or tried different algorithms. I decided to test out only a few features in this exploratory study and leave the rest for another study."

That is a beautiful characteristic of this problem - than many things (even things which are beyond the scope of financial figures and stock prices, such as Wikipedia page views) can be used as features or proxies for stock prices."
