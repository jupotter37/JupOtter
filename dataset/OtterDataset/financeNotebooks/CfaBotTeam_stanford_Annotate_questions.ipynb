       "\"\\nWithin this section we will focus on determining the difference between marginal benefit and marginal cost, as well as how to calculate the efficient quantity. \\n\\nConsumer Choice\\nEconomic analysis generally assigns the following properties to consumers:\\n\\n\\nConsumers make rational decisions. If two products are of equal benefit to a consumer, then he or she will choose the cheaper product. If two products are the same price, the consumer will choose the one that provides the higher benefit. \\n\\n\\n\\nLimited income enforces choice. Consumers have to make choices as to what goods will be purchased or not purchased. Purchasing one item means that less funds are available to purchase other items. \\n\\n\\n\\nSubstitution of goods. Consumers can achieve satisfaction, which is generally referred to as utility, with many choices. The satisfaction and cost of a cheeseburger can be evaluated in comparison to other goods - such as hot dogs. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. This law refers to marginal utility, which describes the increase in satisfaction from consuming one additional unit of the good. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that as each additional unit of a good is consumed, the amount of marginal (incremental) utility will decrease.\\n\\nEconomists believe that consumers make decisions at the margin; i.e. should one more unit of the good be obtained or not? The consumer will compare the additional (marginal) utility to be achieved by consuming one more unit of the good, to the additional (marginal) utility that must be given up (buying power) in order to obtain the good. At any particular price, the consumer will continue to buy units of the good as long as the marginal benefit, as expressed by maximum willingness to pay, exceeds the price. The marginal benefit indicates, in dollar terms, what the consumer is willing to pay to acquire one more unit of the good; it can also be related to the height of an individual's demand curve. Another implication of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is that the height of the demand curve will fall as more units of the good are consumed.\\n\\nAnother implication of marginal utility theory is that for consumers to maximize utility, the following relationship holds:\\n\\nMUa =  MUb =  MUc = and so on...\\nPa Pb Pc\\n\\nMU refers to marginal utility of the good, P represents the price of the good, and the subscripts indicate a particular good. The last unit of each good purchased will provide the same marginal utility per dollar spent on that good.\\n\\nThe term marginal cost refers to the opportunity cost associated with producing one more additional unit of a good. Opportunity cost is a critical concept to economics - it refers to the value of the highest value alternative opportunity. For example, in examining the marginal cost of producing one more bushel of wheat, that number could be expressed as the dollar value of corn or other goods that could be produced in lieu of more wheat. \\n\\nMarginal benefit refers to what people are willing to give up in order to obtain one more unit of a good, while marginal cost refers to the value of what is given up in order to produce that additional unit. Additional units of a good should be produced as long as marginal benefit exceeds marginal cost. It would be inefficient to produce goods when the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost. Therefore an efficient level of product is achieved when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost.\\n\\nConsumer Surplus and Marginal Benefit\\r\\nConsumer surplus represents the difference between what a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price paid. If a consumer is willing to pay $5.00 for a gallon of gasoline, and the actual price is $3.00, then there is a consumer surplus of $2.00 with the purchase of that gallon of gasoline. The value to the consumer, or marginal benefit, is $5.00. Value is calculated by getting the maximum price that consumers are willing to pay.\\n\\nWe expect consumers to continue purchasing units of a good as long as the marginal benefit exceeds the price paid; i.e., as long as there is a consumer surplus to be achieved. \\n\\n\\n    \""

       "\"BREAKING DOWN 'Accounting Theory': While accounting procedures are formulaic in nature, accounting theory is more qualitative in that it is a guide for effective accounting and financial reporting. The most important aspect of accounting theory is usefulness, which, in the corporate finance world, means that all financial statements should provide important information that can be used to make informed business decisions. This also means that accounting theory is intentionally flexible so that it can provide effective financial information, even when the legal environment changes.\""

For a positively skewed, unimodal distribution, the mode is less than the median, which is less than the mean. The mean is affected by outliers; in a positively skewed distribution, there are large, positive outliers which will tend to âpullâ the mean upward, or more positive. An example of a positively skewed distribution is that of housing prices. Suppose that you live in a neighborhood with 100 homes; 99 of them sell for $100,000, and one sells for $1,000,000. The median and the mode will be $100,000, but the mean will be $109,000. Hence, the mean has been \"pulledâ upward (to the right) by the existence of one home (outlier) in the neighborhood. For a negatively skewed, unimodal distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. In this case, there are large, negative outliers that tend to âpullâ the mean downward (to the left). '"

      "Calculation and Application: Investors require compensation for risk and opportunity cost. The risk-free rate is a theoretical interest rate that would be paid by an investment with zero risk, and long-term yields on U.S. treasuries have traditionally been used as a proxy for the risk-free rate because of the low default risk. Treasuries have historically had relatively low yields as a result of this assumed reliability. Equity market returns are based on expected returns on a broad benchmark index such as the Standard & Poor's 500 index of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Real equity returns fluctuate with operational performance of the underlying business, and the market pricing for these securities reflects this fact. Historical return rates have fluctuated as the economy matures and endures cycles, but conventional knowledge has generally estimated long-term potential of approximately 8% annually. As of 2016, some economists are calling for a reduction in this assumed rate, though opinions on the topic diverge. Investors demand a premium on their equity investment return relative to lower risk alternatives because their capital is more jeopardized, which leads to the equity risk premium.\n",

       "\"While plant size is fixed in the short run, in the long run, firms can choose their most profitable scale of operations. Because the long-run average total cost (LRATC) curve is drawn for many different plant sizes or scales of operation, each point along the curve represents the minimum ATC for a given plant size or scale of operations. In Figure 7, we show a firm's LRATC curve along with short-run average total cost (SRATC) curves for many different plant sizes, with SRATC +1 representing a larger scale of operations than SRATC, We draw the LRATC curve as U-shaped. Average total costs first decrease with larger scale and eventually increase. The lowest point on the LRATC corresponds to the scale or plant size at which the average total cost of production is at a minimum. This scale is sometimes called the minimum efficient scale. Under perfect competition, firms must operate at minimum efficient scale in long-run equilibrium, and LRATC will equal the market price. Recall that under perfect competition, firms earn zero economic profit in long-run equilibrium. Firms that have chosen a different scale of operations with \""

Common shareholders have a residual claim (after the claims of debtholders and preferred stockholders) on firm assets if the firm is liquidated and govern the corporation through voting rights. Firms are under no obligation to pay dividends on common equity; the firm determines what dividend will be paid periodically. Common stockholders are able to vote for the board of directors, on merger decisions, and on the selection of auditors. If they are unable to attend the annual meeting, shareholders can vote by proxy (having someone else vote as they direct them, on their behalf). In a statutory voting system, each share held is assigned one vote in the election of each member of the board of directors. Under cumulative voting, shareholders can allocate their votes to one or more candidates as they choose. For example, consider a situation where a shareholder has 100 shares and three directors will be elected. Under statutory voting, the shareholder can vote 100 shares for his director choice in each election. Under cumulative voting, the shareholder has 300 votes, which can be cast for a single candidate or spread across multiple candidates. The three receiving the greatest number of votes are elected. Cumulative voting makes it possible for a minority shareholder to have more proportional representation on the board. The way the math works, a holder of 30% of the firm's shares could choose three of ten directors with cumulative voting but could elect no directors under statutory voting. \""

In some analyses, the model does hold in real world situations, but most studies have disproved the model for projecting returns. Although the model is not completely valid, that is not to say there is no utility associated with using the CAPM. For instance, the CAPM is often used to estimate a company's weighted average cost of capital.\""

      "BREAKING DOWN 'Commodity Futures Contract': Commodities future contracts can be used by speculators to make directional price bets on raw materials.Â Trading in commodity futures contracts can be very risky for the inexperienced. One cause of this risk is the high amount of leverage involved in holding futures contracts. For example, for an initial margin of about $3,700, an investor can enter into a futures contract for 1,000 barrels of oil valued at $45,000 (with oil priced at $45 per barrel). Given this large amount of leverage, a very small move in the price of a commodity could result in large gains or losses compared to the initial margin. Unlike options, futures are the obligation of the purchase or sale of the underlying asset. Simply not closing an existing position could result in an inexperienced investor taking delivery of a large quantity of an unwanted commodity. Speculation using short positions in futures can lead to unlimited losses.\n",
