      "Rivian reported its Q2 earnings, revealing revenue of $1.12 billion, beating expectations, and an adjusted loss of $1.08 per share, better than anticipated. The company confirmed the production of 13,992 vehicles in Q2, with 12,640 successful deliveries. Despite the positive earnings, the stock did not see a significant boost, with analysts remaining cautious about its near-term performance.\n",

      "[2023-09-29..2023-10-09, -20.63% vs market]\n",
      "Rivian's stock declined following a $1.5 billion convertible debt offering and concerns about management missteps. Analysts lowered their price targets for the stock, citing worries about the timing of the debt offering and its impact on investors. Some analysts believe that the selling of Rivian's stock has been overdone and that the dilution from the debt conversion may not be significant. Rivian is expected to exceed production targets in 2023, but this hasn't helped to alleviate concerns.\n",

      "[2024-02-20..2024-02-26, -34.36% vs market]\n",
      "Truist Securities downgraded Rivian from Buy to Hold and reduced the price target from $26 to $11 as the company prepares to shut down its manufacturing facility for several weeks in Q2. The EV maker's weak production guidance for 2024, anticipating 57,000 vehicles compared to estimates of 81,000, contributed to the stock's decline. Rivian also reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and announced a 10% reduction in its salaried workforce, leading to increased uncertainty and a downward trend in the stock.\n",

      "[2024-11-12..2024-12-16, Market-wide analysis]\n",
      "Rivian announced a lucrative joint venture with Volkswagen, strengthening its market position. This development was part of a broader trend of optimism in the Electric Vehicle sector.\n",
