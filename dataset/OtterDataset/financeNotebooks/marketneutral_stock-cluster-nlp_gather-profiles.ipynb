    "We need a corpus of these profiles for a large set of tickers. Ironically, the \"hardest\" part of this post for me was finding a source of tickers as a base universe. I need this universe off-platform becuase I obtain the profile data off-platform. We get spoiled using the `Q1500US`, etc. on Quantopian which gives a valid tradeable universe; good luck trying to find this outside of Quantopian (unless you buy very expensive index composition data from a major index provider). This is hard because freely available financial data (e.g., Yahoo) exists to satistfy analysis that starts with a question like \"Given AAPL, MSFT, and FB, what...?\". For proper *quantitiative* analysis, this is completely backwards. We don't know *yet* what stocks we care to look at; we need a large valid universe of tickers as a pool to analyze. We need to get this universe cross-sectionally as of a specific date. The best I could find is the [Quandl WIKI PRICES](https://www.quandl.com/product/WIKIP/documentation/about) EOD price database. It's not clear what the complete criteria are for inclusion in this dataset, but it *looks* to me to be an attempt to replicate the Russell 3000. Quandl indicated to me that volume is the primary criterion. This data is free; you need a Quandl API key which you can obtain when you register a free account."
