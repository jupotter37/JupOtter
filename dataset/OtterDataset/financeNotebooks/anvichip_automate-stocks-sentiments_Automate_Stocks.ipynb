              "{'GME': ['By Douglas Gillison and Chris Prentice (Reuters) -Wall Street\\'s top regulator on Wednesday adopted rules tightening the time-frame for stock trades in an effort to tamp down the kind of risk seen in 2021\\'s GameStop fiasco, when retail investors suffered heavy losses. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also proposed changing rules protecting client assets held by investment managers, a move that could hinder cryptocurrency platforms from serving a key marketplace role. In a 3-2 vote, the SEC opted to shorten the time between when a securities order is placed and when a trade concludes -something officials say can lessen the kind of \"systemic risk\" spotlighted in early 2021 when the share price of the consumer electronics retailer GameStop Corp plummeted amid intense market volatility. Trade groups have broadly welcomed the commission\\'s proposal to cut the so-called settlement cycle to a single business day from two, six years after an earlier SEC rule shortened the period from three days. But some have complained the commission isn\\'t leaving enough time for them to adjust before the rule takes effect in May 2024. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda voted against the rule for this reason. The longer a trade remains unsettled, the more likely a buyer or seller may default — by refusing to pay or to hand over shares sold. Clearing houses can require trading platforms to offset such risks with margin deposits, costs that can skyrocket during volatility and market stress. High margin deposits caused trading platforms such as Robinhood Markets to block purchases of GameStop\\'s shares in early 2021. The price then plummeted. A shorter settlement cycle should see fewer defaults, helping cut margin costs and reducing the chances of such a scenario recurring, according to the SEC. SEC TAKES AIM AT CRYPTO \\'CUSTODIANS\\' In a 4-1 vote, the commission proposed new requirements for investment advisers, who can only maintain custody of client funds or securities if they meet requirements to protect the assets. The SEC\\'s draft proposal would expand these requirements to any client assets, including real estate, loan participations and digital assets not currently',\n",

Before kickstarting his illustrious career at Merrill Lynch, Farrell studied at the prestigious Columbia business school under Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Graham and Dodd are widely hailed as the “godfathers of modern value investing” and are best known for their best-selling book “Security Analysis,” which was first published in 1934. In fact, Graham and Dodd are so synonymous with value investing that Warren Buffett (also a student of Graham at Columbia) attributes much of his success to the classic work and teachings of the two value investing legends. A Wall Street Pioneer While Mr. Farrell was educated under the value investing umbrella, he found his niche and success on Wall Street at the intersection of technical analysis, sentiment, and market psychology. Though this type of analysis was considered unconventional and even frowned upon at the onset of his career, by the end of Farrell’s nearly five-decade run on Wall Street, it had become mainstream. Farrell became so respected in market circles that his daily newsletter was read by several of the world’s sharpest money managers, including the likes of multi-billionaire George Soros. There is little Mr. Farrell hasn’t seen or experienced throughout his career. Below are Farrell’s 10 Rules: 1.\\xa0\\xa0 Markets tend to revert to the mean over time.

The week also featured the year’s first big blow to a dip-buying strategy that by one measure has been as strong as any year since 1928. And warnings are blaring from bonds, whose bullish thrust had given cover to equity faithful convinced they’d weathered the worst the Federal Reserve had to give. Signs of disenchantment were also visible a week earlier among hedge funds, whose trimming of positions was the biggest in two years, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. data. The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% in the past five days for the worst week since mid-December. While one bad stretch doesn’t prove anything, it highlights the riskiness of a runup that has inflated equity prices by $5 trillion at a time when central bankers say their inflation-fighting campaign may have years to go and data on earnings and the economy continue to crater. Buying stocks now means taking a flier on valuations that are high by most historical standards and betting against a pundit class that is united as it ever has been in the view that stocks are due for a reckoning. “The first half of the year is likely to show the impact of rate hikes that began all the way back in early 2022, that are finally feeding through the economy,” said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “We would not have a lot of confidence that this rally that we’ve seen in early 2023 is sustainable until we see the impact of rate',\n",
              "  'Beta: A Volatility Measuring Tool In the context of Wall Street, beta is a gauge of a stock’s movement or volatility compared to the general market – typically the S&P 500 Index. Beta measures the magnitude to which a stock fluctuates versus the fluctuations of the major market indices. How does it work? A beta of 1.0 means that a stock hypothetically has the same magnitude of movement as the overall market. A beta higher than 1.0 means the stock is more volatile than the market. For example, a beta of 1.20 would suggest that the underlying equity moves about 20% more than the S&P 500 Index. Examples of high beta stocks include Credo Tech CRDO and GameStop Corp GME – which regularly see moves of 10% or more in each direction. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Generally, low beta stocks can be optimal for investors because they provide less wild swings, and ultimately less risk – all else being equal. On the contrary, some degree of beta is needed within a portfolio to achieve higher returns. Remember, no risk, no returns. Another example of a high beta stock would be Tesla TSLA. Tesla has a beta of 1.74, meaning it tends to move 74% more than the market. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research As an investor, it is best to find the mix that works for you best. There is no “one size fits all” solution, and often the best portfolios have a mix between both high and low beta stocks.

              "  \"By Nell Mackenzie LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds betting against stocks globally abandoned those trades last week at the fastest pace since 2015, surpassing the speed of their exodus from the meme stock frenzy two years ago, according to a Goldman Sachs research note. The latest short squeeze, implying that stock prices rose so much that bearish bets become too expensive to hold, saw hedge funds caught out by a sharp rally in equities on Feb. 2 after the U.S. Federal Reserve slowed the pace of interest rate hikes and markets anticipated that rates would peak soon. According to the Goldman note, seen by Reuters, the speed at which hedge funds exited bearish positions surpassed that seen in January 2021 when retail traders worked in concert to push shortsellers out of stocks such as videogame retailer Gamestop and movie theatre operator AMC Entertainment Holdings. The 2021 buying frenzy started on social media site Reddit, and at-home traders used retail trading platforms such as Robinhood to lift the price of heavily shorted stocks such as Gamestop. This forced many shortsellers out of positions and in some cases, funds restructured and returned money to their investors. Last week's short-squeeze followed a post-Fed rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged 3.25% on Thursday - its biggest one-day jump in over two months - led by over 20% surges in orthodontic company Align Technology and Facebook parent company Meta Platforms. That came just a day before a sharp selloff on Friday when stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data sparked a selloff in world stocks. World stocks were last down 0.7% with Friday's strong U.S. jobs report renewing concerns that the Fed may have to remain aggressive in its monetary tightening to tame inflation. The largest short positions held by hedge funds were in industrials and information technology companies, the Goldman note said. It added that hedge funds also exited many long positions in Asian developing markets and Chinese equities. Meanwhile, after stuttering recoveries during a volatile two years, AMC and GME are now trading above their price levels of Jan. 15, 2021 just before the meme stock frenzy\",\n",

According to Rick Rieder, BlackRock\\'s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, the size of the market opportunity for AI and generally sound fundamentals of many of the companies innovating stand in contrast to the themes that drove up meme stocks — namely, increased leverage and the low-interest rate environment. \"This, I think, is something a bit different,\" Rieder told Yahoo Finance Live (video above), adding: \"it\\'s a pretty big evolution of where commerce is going to go.\" On Tuesday, Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled a new version of its Bing search engine that runs on a beefed-up version of OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT natural language AI tech. \"It\\'s a new day in search,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said. \"It\\'s a new paradigm for search.\" Microsoft\\'s AI hype sent shares soaring 12% year to date, despite a soft fourth quarter and mixed outlook at the hands of sluggish global economic growth. C3.ai (AI) unveiled a new set of tools in late January to support generative AI for enterprise applications. Its stock has exploded 129% this year. The excitement has spilled over into more speculative AI names such as SoundHound (SOUN) and BigBear.ai (BBAI), as Yahoo Finance\\'s Julie Hyman reported. \"The question is: In some places is [the buying] overdone because people all flow into the area at once?\" Rieder said. \"I don\\'t think this one is akin to what happened last year [in meme stocks]. That was clear speculation and overzealousness.\" The only AI play being left out of the frenzy is the fundamentally strong Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Yahoo Finance\\'s Dan Howley reported that Alphabet released a host of new AI-powered features for its Search, Maps, and Lens apps on Wednesday. Yet, Google stock fell more than 7% as of afternoon trading as investors saw Alphabet as suddenly behind Microsoft in the race to add AI to search. \"Microsoft looks well',\n",

Unprofitable, highly speculative, and heavily shorted stocks rose due to hype and speculative juices, not fundamental or news-driven reasons. Bed Bath & Beyond seemed to be the driving force.

Traditionally the word “recall” conveys bringing one’s car to a mechanic for work. For instance, last month, under pressure from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Tesla “recalled” more than 360,000 vehicles equipped with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software because of apparent crash risks. But with the fix requiring merely software update, Musk agreed with a Twitter user who wrote: “Seems like there should be terminology introduced to differentiate between recalls and software updates. Because you know, one requires something to be recalled and the other doesn’t.” Musk replied: “Definitely. The word ‘recall’ for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong.” He made a similar statement in September last year, tweeting: “The terminology is outdated & inaccurate.” That was after a “recall” of 1.1 million Tesla vehicles to ensure they fully complied with the NHTSA’s safety requirements regarding power windows. “This is a tiny over-the-air software update,” Musk added. From the beginning, Tesla designed its vehicles with the advantage of over-the-air fixes and updates in mind. Last year, the consulting firm Deloitte published a study on software-defined vehicles, calling Tesla “the quintessential leader” of the trend. “The software-defined vehicle’s transformation will be an inexorable trend driving the development of the automotive industry over the next five to 10 years,” it added. But this time around, actual bolts might be rattling around, and for safety reasons they need to be secured—physically.

While Mexico welcomed the investment, Tesla said it \"did not need any sort of fiscal stimulus\" beyond the benefits allowed under Mexico\\'s free trade agreements to build the plant, according to Ramirez.

Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) ranked second with $228.7 billion in clean revenue, followed by Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE.DE) ($89 billion), Verizon Communications (VZ) ($80 billion), and Tesla (TSLA) ($53 billion). “The spread of the great transition that we\\'re in the middle of is spreading out even further globally — that every country in the world will soon have major companies making major money employing major numbers of people as part of this global transformation,” As You Sow CEO Andrew Behar told Yahoo Finance. What began in 2016 as a list of companies leading in clean energy has since expanded to encompass revenue that meets a range of sustainability certifications from electric vehicles to sustainable loans. The list excludes companies with exposure to controversial business practices such as investments in fossil fuels, weapons, and prisons or otherwise \"having a record of systemically obstructing climate policy.\" \"These are the companies that are leading the way by putting sustainability at the heart of their products, services, business models and investments, helping to move the world onto a more sustainable trajectory,\" the report stated.

              "  'Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped Friday after the automaker reported strong China sales. Tesla’s wholesale shipments for February from its China factory rose 32% from a year ago to 74,402 vehicles, according to China’s Passenger Car Association (CPCA). That also figure represents a 13% jump month over month from January. Shares of the EV maker were up nearly 3.6% Friday. The increase in February shipments is not surprising given that CPCA said February sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery electric and hybrid sales, rose by 30% overall. And it noted last month that January would be a “weak” month for overall sales in the region due to the Chinese New Year. Nevertheless, stronger sales in February for Tesla is a positive development as competition rises in the important Chinese EV market, where Tesla is getting an increasing amount of its global sales. \"Tesla’s continued growth in China should come as no surprise,\" Chandan Kumar, head of products at index provider Indxx, said. \"As a logical result of this Tesla, despite what many Americans may think, only gets roughly 31% of its total sales from the US, with the rest essentially all from China and Europe.\" Recent price cuts in January of the Chinese-made Model 3 and the Model Y — which were cut by 13.5% and 10%, respectively — are clearly giving Tesla a boost in the region, despite competitors like BYD outselling them in February. BYD’s new energy vehicle sales jumped by over 100% to 193,655.

Tesla stock is still down more than 50% from its November 2021 high of roughly $410 per share, but Vanda Research’s head of data Giacomo Pierantoni told the Wall Street Journal's Jack Pitcher that record “retail inflows” are helping boost the company’s stock price. The huge jump in Tesla stock purchases coincides with increasing retail investor optimism about the future of the U.S. stock market overall. A new Charles Schwab Trader Sentiment Survey found that bullishness among investors on Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade nearly doubled this quarter after declining throughout 2022. In the fourth quarter of last year, just 18% of U.S. investors were bullish on stocks, with 68% saying they were bearish. Now, 35% are bullish and just 48% are bearish. And young investors—who are more likely to purchase high-risk, high-reward stocks like Tesla—have shifted their views even more dramatically, with 40% saying they are now bullish compared to just 15% in the fourth quarter. Tesla investors are known for their loyalty, and that was put on display ahead of the company’s annual Investor\",\n",
              "  'The electric vehicle market is exploding worldwide. By 2030, the International Energy Agency predicts, EVs will represent 60% of all vehicle sales globally. And in the U.S., despite total vehicle sales dropping 8% year over year in 2022, sales of EVs jumped 65%, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. Although countries like China have grabbed headlines in the EV race, the biggest beneficiary of all that expansion might be Mexico.

Mexico has the world’s 10th-largest store of lithium, which is a key component used in EV batteries that is commonly referred to as the industry’s “white gold.” And the country’s current auto manufacturing strength, coupled with an increase in nearshoring—where manufacturers rework supply chains closer to home—after pandemic-era supply-chain mishaps, is likely to make it an EV powerhouse in the future, Czerwonko and Soni said. But the pair were also careful to warn that Mexico’s EV success is not guaranteed, and that it “faces a long road ahead” owing to one key factor: a lack of energy infrastructure necessary to go all in on EV manufacturing. Mexico is already the fourth-largest exporter and seventh-largest producer of cars globally, and hosts a number of big-name automakers, including Toyota, Kia, Volkswagen, and Nissan. Ford even produces its Mustang Mach-E EV at the Cuautitlán Stamping and Assembly Plant in Cuautitlán Izcalli, about 20 miles outside Mexico City. Multiple automakers have also recently announced moves into Mexico to produce EVs. General Motors said last year it will build the 2024 Blazer EV and Equinox EV at its factory in'],\n",
              " 'BTC': ['Silvergate Capital is expressing doubts about its ability to say in business. The holding company that provides financial services to crypto firms issued a going concern warning. Cryptocurrencies fell on the news and two cryptocurrency exchanges dropped Silvergate as their banking partner. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both down more than 3% in the past 24 hours. Silvergate said it is in the process of reevaluating its businesses and strategies in light of current business and regulatory challenges. As a result, the company is delaying its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The bank said it would be unable to meet an extended March 16 SEC deadline and is in the process of selling additional debt securities to pay the bills in 2023. \"The Registrant requires additional time to perform analysis, record journal entries related to subsequent events and to complete management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting,\" Silvergate said in a regulatory filing. FTX CO-FOUNDER NISHAD SINGH PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD CHARGES The crypto bank reported a $1 billion loss for the fourth quarter as investors raced to withdraw deposits in the wake of FTX\\'s bankruptcy, suggesting the firm\\'s troubles highlight the fragility of confidence in digital assets. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP Silvergate sold additional debt securities in January and February 2023 and expects to record further losses. \"These additional losses will negatively impact the regulatory capital ratios of the company and the company\\'s wholly owned subsidiary, Silvergate Bank, and could result in the company and the bank being less than well-capitalized,\" the filing said. Silvergate, one of the most influential banks in the digital asset industry, has drawn the ire of lawmakers in the United States over its dealings with FTX and Alameda.

Secure your seat today Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, sold 650 bitcoins out of 683 it mined in February. The company said it sold the bitcoin to help pay for operating expenses and for general corporate purposes, according to a statement. Marathon sold 1,500 bitcoins in January, which marked the first time it had unloaded any of its holdings. Even with the February sales, said company Chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, Marathon increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings from 8,090 bitcoins as of Jan. 31, 2023, to 8,260, valued at $191.2 million as of Feb. 28. The move to sell brings Marathon's strategy in line with some of its peers, including Riot Platforms (RIOT), which started selling some of its mined bitcoin last year. Prior to January, Marathon was among few remaining miners who continued to hold onto its mined bitcoin, even though the company in May 2022 indicated it could become a seller at some point. Turning to operations, Marathon said it had installed computing power of 14 exahash per second (EH/s) at the end of February, up from 11 EH/s a month earlier, and plans to reach 23 EH/s near the middle of 2023. The company ended the month with $219.7 million in unrestricted cash on hand, according to the statement. Earlier this week, the miner cancelled its earnings report and said that it will need to restate portions of its audited 2021 results and currently unaudited quarterly reports from 2022 after an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) flagged technical accounting matters. Riot Platforms on Thursday also said it will delay its 10-K filings with the SEC due to due to issues raised by its accounting firm about the company's impairment calculations related to its bitcoin assets. Marathon's shares were little changed in after-hours trading on Thursday, remaining higher by more than 80% in 2023. Bitcoin is down about 1% over the last 24 hours and higher by 42% year to date.

In line with Bitcoin, the total market capitalization for crypto assets fell 4.6% from $1.06 trillion to $1.02 trillion between 8:18 p.m. to 9:05 p.m. New York time. Bitcoin hasn’t plunged so fast and sharp since the price fell by 4% $20,538 to $19,704 on the morning of Tuesday, November 8 as FTT the token for crypto exchange FTX faced massive withdrawals. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is changing hands at $22,381, down 4.3% for the last 24 hours and 6.4% over the past week. Over the past two days, the crypto market is coming to grips with the potential failure of crypto industry-serving bank, Silvergate. “Fortunately, Silvergate is not FTX. Silvergate is more of a fiat on/off-ramp for U.S. Dollars, rather than a key source of liquidity and volume for the entire crypto ecosystem,” said Michael Safai a co-founder and partner of crypto proprietary trading firm Dexterity Capital. The La Jolla, Calif. headquartered Silvergate said in a Wednesday late notice it would further delay its annual report due to greater losses than it showed in January preliminary results in addition to “certain regulatory and other inquiries and investigations that are pending with respect to the Company” and its \"ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the issuance of these financial statements,\" according to the filing.

Further exacerbating Silvergate’s business challenges, Coinbase, Paxos, Galaxy Digital, Gemini, BitStamp, Crypto.com, Cboe Digital, GSR and Circle each issued statements saying they have cut ties with what was once considered a crucial banking partner for the sector. Stablecoin issuer Circle added, its “in the process of unwinding certain services with them.” Separately, Binance US and Kraken would not comment on their exposure to Silvergate. “There is some dismay around the Silvergate news, but it\\'s not clear it',\n",

After briefly falling below the $1 trillion mark in early February prompted by concerns of a crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has begun to trade in green once again as it has surged by 8.57% overnight to $1.12 trillion, an indication that the downward trend was a precursor to the next bull cycle. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) account for more than 60% of cryptocurrency’s performance, it is imperative that it receives the support of much newer currencies, and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) has come forward as a formidable force bearing the potential of becoming the next big cryptocurrency. Launched in August 2022, Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is a new ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum Network with KYC certification from CoinSniper and its smart contract fully audited by Solidity Finance. A cat-based meme token, Big Eyes Coin is owned by its community with the ultimate goal of shifting wealth into the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Since its launch, Big Eyes Coin has been making heads turn among the crypto community. Tipped by several crypto experts to become the next big meme token, Big Eyes Coin has already become the most successful presale in recent times and has raised $27.5 million in presale tokens. The presale is currently in its 11th stage and tokens are selling at exponential speed towards reaching the $50 million presale target and four more stages left to go before it goes live on the market. Big Eyes Coin has been accepted by investors with overwhelming admiration having recently received a humongous deposit of $250,000, a timely investment given the bonus code Big Eyes Coin is currently having before the launch date.
