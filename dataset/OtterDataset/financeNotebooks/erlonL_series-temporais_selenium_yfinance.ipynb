       "  'Friday’s market close marked the end of a “triple witching” session where $5.1 trillion in stock index futures, stock index options, and stock options expire simultaneously. September’s triple witching comes the same week as the Federal Reserve kicks off its rate-cutting cycle and a rebalancing of the S&P 500 (^GSPC).&nbsp; eToro US investment and options analyst Bret Kenwell joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss the options playbook after the big day for options traders. “Today was one of the four big expiration dates of the year when it comes to the options market, and you saw that action leading up to today\\'s session with so much back and forth,\" Kenwell tells Yahoo Finance. “We had a late day pop in stocks, and a lot of that plays into the expiration, but I think what\\'s really interesting is when you look at the seasonality in September, it tends to be pretty bad for US stocks, and when you really dial into that seasonality, you see a lot of it comes in the so-called back half of mid-month…so that leaves the door open at least to see some choppiness, some profit taking, or some outright seasonal weakness kind of going into the end of the quarter.” Kenwell says he’s expecting strength in the tech sector after “tech has sort of fallen by the wayside amid all this, you know, breadth expansion...suddenly it\\'s gone from the favorite stocks, the leadership group to being, I think it\\'s the fourth or fifth best performer of the year.” Kenwell says there were “a lot of put sales into some of the Magnificent Seven names or a lot of the semiconductor leaders” during downturns earlier in the month. He adds “I don\\'t know that that\\'s necessarily the best way for a retail investor to play. It\\'s probably a more reasonable way to play at this point would be by either buying calls or if they wanted to reduce that cost and limit their upside a bit. Call spread would be a great way to get into it.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

Now you combine that with a strong corporate sector, a strong household sector, good corporate earnings, this is a market that can continue to work,\" Temple tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that the election could be a risk moving forward, explaining that the combination of the winning presidential candidate and whichever party secures control of Congress has the potential to change the United States\\' economic trajectory. He also points to the growing deficit as a longer-term concern: \"You can\\'t continue to run a 6% of GDP [Gross Domestic Product] deficit and expect not to have some consequences down the road.\" With the third quarter earnings season on deck, Temple expects to see a broadening of corporate profit out of Big Tech and into the rest of the S&P 500 (^GSPC). \"When you look, for example, at the second quarter earnings season that we wrapped up about a month ago, the big six tech stocks had earnings gains of over 40%. The rest of the market only delivered about 5% earnings growth year-on-year. By the fourth quarter of this year, the consensus is that\\'s going to narrow down to a 21% earnings growth for the big six tech stocks and 9 to 10% for the rest of the market.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened in negative territory, just one morning after the market rallied on the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate cut cycle and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched new record highs. John Hancock investment management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland explains, “It\\'s six straight days of gains leading markets higher [and] riskier assets are really celebrating this idea that the Fed can stave off a hard landing, prevent a contraction from happening, do it proactively before we see more weakness here in the labor market.\" As mega-cap tech stocks gain and September\\'s interest rate cut sent markets higher, Raymond James Investment Management chief market strategist Matt Orton still likes the Big Tech sector: “There\\'s plenty of reasons that clients still want to own the mega-cap technology names. Especially the high-quality ones that are generating $50 [billion], $60 [billion], $70 billion of free cash flow per year. But what I\\'ve been encouraging clients really for the past three months or so is that we have an opportunity to build better balance in our portfolios.” Shares of Nike (NKE) are rallying after the company announced that CEO John Donahoe will be stepping down next month after a rocky five years at the company. Nike veteran Elliott Hill will come out of retirement to fill the role of CEO and president effective October 14. Barclays consumer discretionary analyst Adrienne Yih believes that Hill will prioritize relationships with wholesale retail partners as he steps into the role: \"It\\'s the base for kind of the brand strength going forward. And even though it\\'s margin dilutive, when you\\'re a $50 billion global footprint brand, you need both channels to be working in your favor.\" She argues that Hill is the right person for the job, explaining that he\\'s well-liked at the company, and before his retirement, his positions at Nike focused on the global marketplace. Apple\\'s (AAPL) iPhone 16 lineup is here and consumers are already coming in droves to get their hands on the new device. Yahoo Finance anchor Josh Lipton reports live from the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City where the new iPhones are already being sold, an occasion marked by CEO Tim Cook opening the doors to customers. Investors can brace for more volatility in Friday\\'s trading session as more than $5 trillion in options are set to expire.

Stovall also says that September and October tend to be the worst months for markets during election years but \"traditionally, we get that end of year pop after the uncertainty around the election itself has run its course.\" Stovall reminds investors that the market has been anticipating this latest rate cut for some time, so Wall Street has already been piling into large-cap stocks, tech in particular. He says there are opportunities now to get discounts on small and mid cap stocks. Watch the video above to hear Stovall explain that despite Thursday\\'s record close for the S&P 500, there is still room for the index to go higher.

       "  'Raymond James Investment Management chief market strategist Matt Orton joins Brad Smith and Seana Smith on Morning Brief’s Strategy Session to discuss how to play artificial intelligence (AI) stocks beyond the Big Tech names. As mega-cap tech stocks gain and September\\'s interest rate cut sends the market higher (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC), Orton says he still likes the Big Tech sector. “There\\'s plenty of reasons that clients still want to own the mega-cap technology names. Especially the high-quality ones that are generating $50 [billion], $60 [billion], $70 billion of free cash flow per year. But what I\\'ve been encouraging clients really for the past three months or so is that we have an opportunity to build better balance in our portfolios.” “Now that we\\'re finally starting to get rate cuts, I think we\\'re starting to see more of a clear path to get to that soft landing. That should support a lot more cyclical parts of the market, too, that maybe haven\\'t done as well as technology,\" he says about the Federal Reserve\\'s rate cut move. Orton explains that there are stocks and sectors he sees benefiting from the AI boom without being directly tied to developing the tech the way Big Tech companies are, what he calls the “AI 2.0 bucket.\" “Take the industrial space, for example. You look at electric equipment companies. We know we need more power in this country. We also know we need to cool data centers down as you continue to get more of them. So companies that are producing cooling solutions and liquid cooling, those names look very attractive.” Orton says he tells clients to “play offense with defense” as while there are concerns around geopolitical conflict, defense companies are benefiting from governments\\' increased spending. “You\\'re finally seeing that translate into increased earnings and free cash flow across a number of defense companies.” “There\\'s an opportunity in that part of the market and in totally non-related to artificial intelligence,” that “aren\\'t just tech or semiconductors,” Orton tells Yahoo Finance.

       "  \"As the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) reacts to the Federal Reserve’s first rate cut in four years, John Hancock investment management co-chief investment strategist Emily Roland joins Brad Smith and Seana Smith on Morning Brief to take a closer look at navigating the market amid changing sentiment. “It's six straight days of gains leading markets higher [and] riskier assets are really celebrating this idea that the Fed can stave off a hard landing, prevent a contraction from happening, do it proactively before we see more weakness here in the labor market,” Roland tells Yahoo Finance. The strategist says there are three key signs that a soft landing can be achieved. “The first one is that you need to see no real further cracks in the labor market.” Secondly, Roland is watching credit market conditions. “The final thing is the fed actually has to deliver on what the bond market is pricing in.” Roland indicates the bond market has priced in another 50 basis points cut this year, and another 100 points cut in 2025, which is consistent with the Fed’s dot plot. “You're seeing the riskiest parts of the market, the most cyclical areas, small caps really being a poster child for that really taking off amidst this dovish turn from the Fed, but at the end of the day, there's not a lot of fundamental support for it.” Roland believes a lot of the upside is already priced into small caps. “When you look at the outperformance of small caps, they're up 8% [to] 9% quarter to date. While the S&P 500 is up about 3%. You're seeing some profit taking in large-cap names and a rotation into small caps. We really see that as a sentiment-driven rally.” “Of [small caps’] 8% return this quarter, it's been entirely driven by multiple expansion, not earnings growth. In fact, in the second quarter, the S&P 500 saw double-digit positive earnings growth. Small cap equities saw 15% negative year-over-year earnings growth for the second quarter,” Roland says, adding that analysts expect this “muted earnings growth” to persist in the third quarter. Believing the upside is already priced into small caps, Roland says “we continue to overweight the quality factor. So these are companies with great balance sheets, tons of cash, good free cash flow, the ability to maintain margins in an environment where margins pressure is happening and playing out right now. So the poster child for high quality is going to be megacap tech.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.
