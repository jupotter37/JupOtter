        "Computational complexity is a branch of computer science that studies the amount of resources (such as time and space) required to solve computational problems. Specifically, computational complexity theory seeks to classify problems according to their difficulty, and to understand the inherent limits of computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In computational complexity theory, problems are typically classified into different complexity classes based on the amount of resources required to solve them. For example, the class P contains problems that can be solved in polynomial time, and the class NP contains problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept of computational complexity is important because it helps us understand which problems are tractable (solvable efficiently) and which problems are intractable (solvable only inefficiently). For example, some problems may require exponentially more time or space to solve as the size of the input increases, making them impractical to solve for large input sizes. Understanding the complexity of a problem is essential for developing efficient algorithms and for determining the practical limits of computing."

        "\n",

        "* Checking if a graph is bipartite: Given an undirected graph, the problem is to determine if it can be partitioned into two sets of vertices such that no two vertices in the same set are adjacent.

In contrast, many interesting problems in NP are believed to be intractable for large inputs, meaning that their solution time grows exponentially with the size of the input. However, it's important to note that not all interesting problems are known to be in either P or NP."

        "In addition to P and NP, there are several other complexity classes that are important in computational complexity theory. Here are some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "* NP-hard: A problem is NP-hard if every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time. This means that NP-hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. The canonical example of an NP-hard problem is the decision version of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).\n",
        "\n",
        "* NP-complete: A problem is NP-complete if it is in NP and is also NP-hard. This means that NP-complete problems are the hardest problems in NP. The canonical example of an NP-complete problem is the decision version of the traveling salesman problem (TSP).\n",
        "\n",
        "* PSPACE: PSPACE stands for \"polynomial space\". This is the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial space by a deterministic Turing machine. PSPACE includes many interesting problems, such as the quantified Boolean formula problem and the game of Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "* EXPTIME: EXPTIME stands for \"exponential time\". This is the class of decision problems that can be solved in exponential time by a deterministic Turing machine. EXPTIME includes many problems that are intractable for practical input sizes, such as the decision version of the general satisfiability problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  BPP: BPP stands for \"bounded error probabilistic polynomial time\". This is the class of decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time with a randomized algorithm that makes at most a certain probability of error (e.g., less than 1/3). BPP includes many important randomized algorithms, such as the Miller-Rabin primality test and the Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating the value of pi.\n",

For example, to prove that a problem is in P, one needs to provide an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time, and to prove that a problem is in NP, one needs to provide a polynomial-time verifier for the problem.\n",
