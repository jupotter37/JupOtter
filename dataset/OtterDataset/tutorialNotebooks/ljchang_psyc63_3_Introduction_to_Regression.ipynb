    "## Confidence in our Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's examine the output. To learn more about Statsmodels and how to interpret the output, DataRobot has some decent posts on [simple linear regression](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/ordinary-least-squares-in-python/) and [multiple linear regression](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/multiple-regression-using-statsmodels/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Is linear regression a high bias/low variance model, or a low bias/high variance model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** High bias/low variance. Under repeated sampling, the line will stay roughly in the same place (low variance), but the average of those models won't do a great job capturing the true relationship (high bias). Note that low variance is a useful characteristic when you don't have a lot of training data!\n",
    "\n",
    "A closely related concept is **confidence intervals**. Statsmodels calculates 95% confidence intervals for our model coefficients, which are interpreted as follows: If the population from which this sample was drawn was **sampled 100 times**, approximately **95 of those confidence intervals** would contain the \"true\" coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing and p-values\n",
    "\n",
    "Closely related to confidence intervals is **hypothesis testing**. Generally speaking, you start with a **null hypothesis** and an **alternative hypothesis** (that is opposite the null). Then, you check whether the data supports **rejecting the null hypothesis** or **failing to reject the null hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that \"failing to reject\" the null is not the same as \"accepting\" the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis may indeed be true, except that you just don't have enough data to show that.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As it relates to model coefficients, here is the conventional hypothesis test:\n",
    "- **null hypothesis:** There is no relationship between gender and salary (and thus $\\beta_1$ equals zero)\n",
    "- **alternative hypothesis:** There is a relationship between TV ads and Sales (and thus $\\beta_1$ is not equal to zero)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we test this hypothesis? Intuitively, we reject the null (and thus believe the alternative) if the 95% confidence interval **does not include zero**. Conversely, the **p-value** represents the probability that the coefficient is actually zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Model Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goodness of how well the model fits the data can be described using the AIC or BIC which are information criterions that penalize for the number of free parameters in the model.  A common way to evaluate the overall fit of a linear model is **$R^2$** value. $R^2$ is the **proportion of variance explained**, meaning the proportion of variance in the observed data that is explained by the model, or the reduction in error over the **null model**. (The null model just predicts the mean of the observed response, and thus it has an intercept and no slope.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$ is between 0 and 1, and higher is better because it means that more variance is explained by the model. Here's an example of what R-squared \"looks like\":\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model above, we see that $R^2$=0.09, which means that gender does not do a great job at predicting the overall salary."
