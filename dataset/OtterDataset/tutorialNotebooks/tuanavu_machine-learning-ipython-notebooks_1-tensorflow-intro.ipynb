    "- What is a tensor? Up to this point in the machine learning series, we've been working mainly with vectors (numpy arrays), and a tensor can be a vector. Most simply, a tensor is an array-like object, and, as you've seen, an array can hold your matrix, your vector, and really even a scalar.\n",
    "- We have data (X), weights (w), and thresholds (t). Are all of these tensors? X will be the dataset (an array), so that's a tensor. The weights are also an array of weight values, so they're tensors too. Thresholds? Same as weights. Thus, our neural network is indeed a function of X,w, and t, or f(Xwt), so we are all set and can certainly use TensorFlow.\n",
    "- TensorFlow works by first defining and describing our model in abstract, and then, when we are ready, we make it a reality in the session. The description of the model is what is known as your \"Computation Graph\" in TensorFlow terms."
