    "Now that we have a basic handle on overfitting (and underfitting), we can start thinking about ways to minimize the problem. In a sense, each of the remaining sections in this tutorial focuses on a different kind of solution. In this section, we'll talk about model validation. While model validation doesn't *directly* prevent overfitting, it plays an important indirect role. If we don't have a good way to recognize overfitting when it happens, we're not going to be in a great position to mitigate it.\n",
