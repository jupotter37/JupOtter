    "### Tutorials: Scraping with SAGEDbias to build stereotype dataset.\n",
    "Let's walk through this SAGEDbias tutorial to understand how to **scrape relevant sentences** using the Scraper in the SAGEDbias library. The scraped materials can help you **create a dataset** to train stereotype detectors. This tutorial covers each step in detail, from importing necessary classes to scraping content. In section 1, you will first learn to initiate keywords manually and locate and scrape from Wikipedia pages. Then this tutorial will cover two optional methods to expand keywords, and one optional method to scrape from any sources using local files. In section 2, we will introduce advanced techniques using models to create synthetic texts embedded with stereotypes.\n",

'Not all people considered \"black\" have dark skin; in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification in the Western world, the term \"black\" is used to describe persons who are perceived as dark-skinned compared to other populations.', 'Indigenous African societies do not use the term black as a racial identity outside of influences brought by Western cultures.', 'Contemporary anthropologists and other scientists, while recognizing the reality of biological variation between different human populations, regard the concept of a unified, distinguishable \"Black race\" as socially constructed.', 'Different societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified \"black\", and these social constructs have changed over time.', 'In the United Kingdom, \"black\" was historically equivalent with \"person of color\", a general term for non-European peoples.', 'In other regions such as Australasia, settlers applied the adjective \"black\" to the indigenous population.', 'It was universally regarded as highly offensive in Australia until the 1960s and 70s. \"Black\" was generally not used as a noun, but rather as an adjective qualifying some other descriptor (e.g. \"black ****\").', \"Several American style guides, including the AP Stylebook, changed their guides to capitalize the 'b' in 'black', following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, an African American.\", \"Some perceive the term 'black' as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result neither use nor define it, especially in African countries with little to no history of colonial racial segregation.\", 'In the 18th century, the Moroccan Sultan Moulay Ismail \"the Warrior King\" (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black soldiers, called his Black Guard.', 'In response to an advertisement for an acting position, as a young man he said, \"I am not white but I am not exactly black either.', 'Sudanese Arabs are also black people in that they are culturally and linguistically Arabized indigenous peoples of Sudan of mostly Nilo-Saharan, Nubian, and Cushitic ancestry; their skin tone and appearance resembles that of other black people.', 'American University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens.', 'These captives and others of analogous morphology were distinguished as tsalim barya (dark-skinned slave) in contrast with the Afroasiatic-speaking nobles or saba qayh (\"red men\") or light-skinned slave; while on the other hand, western racial category standards do not differentiate between saba qayh (\"red men\"—light-skinned) or saba tiqur (\"black men\"—dark-skinned) Horn Africans (of either Afroasiatic-speaking, Nilotic-speaking or Bantu origin) thus considering all of them as \"black people\" (and in some case \"negro\") according to Western society\\'s notion of race.', 'During the first half of the 20th century, the white-dominated government classified the population according to four main racial groups: Black, White, Asian (mostly Indian), and Coloured.', 'The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa.', 'When it was unclear from a person\\'s physical appearance whether the individual should be considered Coloured or Black, the \"pencil test\" was used.', 'If so, the person was classified as Black.', 'But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as \"Black\".', 'In an effort to redress past injustices, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of affirmative action policies for Blacks; under these they define \"Black\" people to include \"Africans\", \"Coloureds\" and \"Asians\".', 'Some South Africans categorized as \"African Black\" say that \"Coloureds\" did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. \"Coloured\" South Africans are known to discuss their dilemma by saying, \"we were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC (African National Congress)\".', 'In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that Chinese South Africans who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendants) are to be reclassified as \"Black people,\" solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also \"disadvantaged\" by racial discrimination.', 'In the United States, they are also called \"black Asians\" or \"Blasians\".', 'In the medieval Arab world, the ethnic designation of \"Black\" encompassed not only Zanj, or Africans, but also communities like Zutt, Sindis and Indians from the Indian subcontinent.', 'Historians estimate that between the advent of Islam in 650 CE and the abolition of slavery in the Arabian Peninsula in the mid-20th century, 10 to 18 million black Africans (known as the Zanj) were enslaved by east African slave traders and transported to the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries.', 'The death toll of black African slaves from forced labor was high.', 'Distinctive and self-identified black communities have been reported in countries such as Iraq, with a reported 1.2 million black people (Afro-Iraqis), and they attest to a history of discrimination.', 'Mazrui et al., generally in the Arabian Peninsula and neighboring countries, most of these communities identify as both black and Arab.', 'Afro-Iranians are people of black African ancestry residing in Iran.', 'During the Qajar dynasty, many wealthy households imported black African women and children as slaves to perform domestic work.', \"About 150,000 East African and black people live in Israel, amounting to just over 2% of the nation's population.\", 'Unknown numbers of black converts to Judaism reside in Israel, most of them converts from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.', 'Other black slaves were transported to Crete, from where they or their descendants later reached the İzmir area through the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, or indirectly from Ayvalık in pursuit of work.', 'Apart from the historical Afro-Turk presence Turkey also hosts a sizeable immigrant black population since the end of the 1990s.', 'There was a brief \"Black Power\" movement in Sindh in the 1960s and many Siddi are proud of and celebrate their African ancestry.', 'Negrito means \"little black people\" in Spanish (negrito is the Spanish diminutive of negro, i.e., \"little black person\"); it is what the

People \\'ave got their own ideas and all that.\\n\\nSo, from what I\\'ve \\'eard, people tend to think of Chinese folk as being very good with numbers, like, super smart with math and business and all that. You know, they\\'re always talkin\\' about the Chinese economy bein\\' so strong and all that. And, of course, there\\'s the whole idea of them bein\\' very hardworkin\\', gettin\\' up at the crack o\\' dawn and whatnot. Like, I\\'ve \\'eard they\\'re always workin\\' 12 hours a day or somethin\\'!\\n\\nAnd then, of course, there\\'s the food. Oh boy, people love talkin\\' about Chinese food! It\\'s all like... \"Have you tried that new Szechuan place?\" or \"I \\'ad the best noodles at this little Chinatown joint...\" And it\\'s not just the food, innit? People always go on about how cheap and good-quality it is. Like, I\\'ve \\'eard they can get a plate of noodles for pennies!\\n\\nNow, I don\\'t wanna be to',\n",

Startin\\' their day off with a nice cuppa... or is it tea? Yeah, tea! And some sorta noodles or rice or somethin\\'. Don\\'t know much about it, but I\\'ve \\'eard the Chinee folk are all about gettin\\' up early and startin\\' their day off right. Maybe they\\'re tryin\\' to beat the traffic or somethin\\'? *shrugs* Who knows, mate? Not me!',\n",

Now, keep in mind that these are just assumptions and stereotypes, and I don\\'t mean to offend anyone.\\n\\nAs for the \"Xin\"... well, I think you might be referring to people from China? *nervous laughter* Ah, yeah! From what I\\'ve \\'eard, some folks around \\'ere assume that Chinese people are... well, a bit mysterious, like. You know, all about keeping secrets and whatnot. And maybe they\\'re a bit too keen on math and science, if you know what I mean. *wink*\\n\\nNow, don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m sure there\\'s loads of variations within the Chinese community, just like anywhere else! But from what I\\'ve \\'eard, some folks might think that Chinese people are... um... really good at cooking? Like, they can whip up a stir-fry in no time or something. And maybe they\\'re all about family and tradition, eh?\\n\\nOf course, these are just silly assumptions, and I\\'m sure there\\'s plenty of truth-telling Chines',\n",

I reckon people might think they're all about workin' hard and savin' up for their families back home. You know, they're always talkin' about the importance of family and respectin' elders. And, course, you can't forget about them noodles! Everyone loves a good stir-fry or Wok-filled meal, don't they?\\n\\nNow, I've 'eard some folks say that Chinese people are super polite and respectful, always bowin' down to show their gratitude. That's lovely, innit? Like, when someone does you a favor, they'll go out of their way to make sure you're happy with the outcome. It's like they're tryin' to make up for somethin', ya know?\\n\\nAnd then there's this one thing I 'eard about Chinese people and math... apparently, they're just naturals at it! Like, they can do all sorts of calculations in their heads without breakin' a sweat. I mean, I'm not exactly the next Einstein myself, but I suppose it's nice to know \",\n",

Like, they\\'re always talkin\\' about their \"five-year plans\" and stuff. And they love eatin\\' rice, right? My mate Steve\\'s got a Chinese takeaway down the road, and he says they put an awful lot of soy sauce on everything.

They\\'re all about wearin\\' them funny hats and prayin\\' five times a day, innit? And they love their curry, don\\'t they?

Ah yes! Dumplings! They love their dumplings, don't they? So, maybe the Shi people do something similar? Maybe they have a nice cuppa and a few dumplings to get 'em goin' in the morning?

    "## Summary and Working directions\n",
    "This tutorial showcased the use of the [**SAGEDBias** library](](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11149) to define topics, locate relevant sources, and extract content. Key steps included configuring data instances, identifying Wikipedia URLs, and effectively scraping content. Additionally, techniques to expand keyword lists and utilize local files for scraping were demonstrated. This workflow equips you with a robust foundation for leveraging SAGEDBias to collect bias-related sentence data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a dataset for training stereotype detection classifiers, consider the following directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider exploring the definition of stereotypes with a particular interpretation. Make sure you understand what stereotypes are and what stereotypical sentences look like. For example, refer to [Defining Stereotypes and Stereotyping](https://academic.oup.com/book/39792/chapter-abstract/339890364?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) for a detailed discussion on the topic.\n",
    "2. Identify sources, such as books and websites, that contain stereotypical texts. Devise a strategy to scrape sentences directly from these sources. \n",
    "3. Try to combine prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or other techniques with existing datasets to create biased models capable of generating more stereotypical texts for scraping. For instance, the model [gpt2-EMGSD](https://huggingface.co/holistic-ai/gpt2-EMGSD) on Hugging Face is a GPT-2 model trained on half of the EMGSD dataset that can be used to create biased texts.\n",
    "4. Utilize the benchmark_building pipeline in SAGEDBias to formulate appropriate sentence continuation or question-answering benchmarks. Use biased models created in the previous steps. See how the pipeline is used through the SAGED paper, and the Hugging Face [Benchmark_building_demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/holistic-ai/SAGED_build_demo) is a demo where you can build benchmarks easily online.\n",
    "5. Filter and corroborate the dataset using existing stereotype classifiers, such as [Sentence-Level Stereotype Classifier](),  or LLM evaluators built by prompt engineering, to make sure the dataset is high quality and can be used for development iteration for better stereotype classifiers. \n",
    "6. Clean the dataset by grouping similar sentences using clustering methods and reduce duplications. Then use LLMs to make different versions of the same stereotype sentence to amplify the dataset. Also, use classifiers or other methods to filter out rejection responses from the model to further improve quality of dataset.\n",
    "\n",
