        "\n",
        "The purpose of this guide is to illustrate the specific architecture choices implemented in Llama 3, which you will find are very similar to prior versions. Check out the YouTube video where i walk through this colab notebook and explain everything step-by-step\n",
        "\n",
        "[![ERROR DISPLAYING IMAGE, CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/lZj8F6EspVU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZj8F6EspVU)\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook guide is designed for beginners; if you already feel confident coding a transformer in pytorch on your own then i recommend instead skimming through the model.py file in the [github repo](https://github.com/evintunador/minLlama3). By beginner, i mean someone who understands matrix/tensor multiplication, general deep learning concepts like what a loss function is, and is capable of looking up pytorch documentation on any given function that they don't recognize, but maybe isn't well versed on transformers specifically. For an even better beginner's guide that uses an outdated architecture, check out [Andrej Karpathy's video on how to build GPT2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=5014s) and then come back here to learn about the more up-to-date methods that Llama 3 utilizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, check out the original open-source release of Llama 3 [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you enjoy this guide, then check out my analogous ones for [Google's Gemma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW7ZxaC3OtA) and [XAI's Grok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9Rdc848EBs).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** It's very easy to convince yourself that you understand something after watching a youtube video about it, but chances are you don't actually understand unless you can code it from scratch on your own. I highly recommend you mess around with this notebook and try to build your own minLlama from scratch\n",
        "\n",
        "# What this guide does NOT include\n",
        "The focus here is on architecture rather than optimization techniques, distributed training/inference, quantization, etc. As such, there are many parts of [the original Llama repo](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3) that will not be included:\n",
        "- the 15 trillion tokens of high quality data that Llama 3 was trained on (we'll be using TinyShakespeare instead)\n",
        "- the original tokenizer--we'll be using a very simple one based on our datset and not going over how it works. Check out [Andrej Karpathy's great video on tokenizers](https://youtu.be/zduSFxRajkE?si=Q2uq_nilHhOegbRi) for a better explanation\n",
        "- the specifics of their training setup that I could not ascertain from their open-sourced inference code (for example: parameter initialization distributions, location of dropout, whether they used regular or chunked attention during training, etc.)\n",
        "- this guide is focused on training rather than inference; we'll do a quick greedy sampling at the end but for real sampling with temperature and whatnot as well as for kv caching during the run check out the code in section 2\n",
        "- other stuff i'm prolly forgetting\n",

        "Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) is a method [originally proposed in 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) that quickly became the defacto standard for enabling transformers to understand positional information (by default the attention mechanism is blind to the ordering of tokens). The method utilizes trigonometry to \"rotate\" the entries in two matrices before they are multiplied together. A small amount of rotation indicates that two tokens are close together, while a large amount of rotation corresponds to being far apart. I'm going to skim over this topic so for a better conceptual explanation, I recommend checking out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQPOtyITy54).\n",

It's nothing interesting though, just a linear layer. Notably they chose to use a separate linear layer rather than re-using the embedding layer as is relatively common"
