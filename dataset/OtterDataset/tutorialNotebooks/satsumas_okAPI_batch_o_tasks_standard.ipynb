    "# How can I make, validate, and run a batch task?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Batching allows you to run identical analyses on different data, by entering multiple input files and grouping them with specified metadata criteria. For instance, you can group input files by File, Sample, Library, Platform unit, or File segment.  By using Batch Input, you can process multiple datasets with a single workflow containing the same parameter settings without having to set up the workflow multiple times. Batching creates one parent task containing multiple child tasks: one for each group of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about [performing a batch analysis](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/perform-batch-analysis) from our Knowledge Center\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "This tutorial introduces you to performing an analysis where you batch by file using the API with the `sevenbridges-python` bindings library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost\n",
    "This will burn through some processing credits (**about \\$0.48** per file). Note that when you signed up for the Seven Bridges Platform, your account was automatically credited with \\$100 in free funds (your Pilot Funds) to use for data analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want to use your credits, you can [create a DRAFT task](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-task) without running it just see how batching works. To do this, just comment out the following line in step 5 below: \n",
