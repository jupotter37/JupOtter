    "# Sudoku as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudoku is a popular number-placement puzzle that originated in France in the end of the 19th century.  Modern Sudoku was likely invented by Howard Garns from Connersville, Indiana and was first published in 1979 under the name *Number Place*. The objective of the puzzle is to place numbers 1-9 on a 9$\\times$9 grid, such that each number occurs only once in every row, every column, and every of the nine 3$\\times$3 sub-grids that compose the main grid.\n",
    "Sudoku puzzles are grids that have been partially occupied with numbers. The task is then to occupy the remaining fields in such a way that the constraints on rows, columns, and sub-grids are satisfied.\n",
    "For more information about Sudoku refer to its Wikipedia page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has two parts. In the first part, you will write the boolean constraints in mathematical notation for solving a Sudoku puzzle. In the second part, you will write code and invoke the Z3 solver to solve the Sudoku instance and answer various questions about the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1 (Constraints)\n",
    "In text, define and write constraints over **boolean** variables corresponding to each number being in each cell. For example, you may use $X_{i,j}^k$ as the variable that is true if and only if the number $k$ is in row $i$ and column $j$ (the variable is true if $k$ is in cell $(i, j)$ and false otherwise). Now write the following boolean constaints over these variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write the boolean formula for the constraints that the number 5 can occur at most once in the first row. **(1 point)**\n",
