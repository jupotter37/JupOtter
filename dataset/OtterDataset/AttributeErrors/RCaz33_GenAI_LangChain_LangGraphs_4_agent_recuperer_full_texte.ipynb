It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 and future\\r\\ngenerations.

The Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\""

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 and future\\r\\ngenerations.

The Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\""

Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!”\\n\\n“I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!” thought Alice.\\n\\nAll this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said, “You’re travelling the wrong way,” and shut up the window and went away.\\n\\n“So young a child,” said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper), “ought to know which way she’s going, even if she doesn’t know her own name!”\\n\\nA Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, “She ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if she doesn’t know her alphabet!”')]}"

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='heard of such a thing!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“—but there’s one great advantage in it, that one’s memory works both\\r\\nways.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure _mine_ only works one way,” Alice remarked. “I can’t remember\\r\\nthings before they happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,” the Queen\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of things do _you_ remember best?” Alice ventured to ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, things that happened the week after next,” the Queen replied in a\\r\\ncareless tone. “For instance, now,” she went on, sticking a large piece\\r\\nof plaster on her finger as she spoke, “there’s the King’s Messenger.\\r\\nHe’s in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn’t even begin\\r\\ntill next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Suppose he never commits the crime?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would be all the better, wouldn’t it?” the Queen said, as she\\r\\nbound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice felt there was no denying _that_. “Of course it would be all the\\r\\nbetter,” she said: “but it wouldn’t be all the better his being\\r\\npunished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re wrong _there_, at any rate,” said the Queen: “were _you_ ever\\r\\npunished?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only for faults,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you were all the better for it, I know!” the Queen said\\r\\ntriumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but then I _had_ done the things I was punished for,” said Alice:\\r\\n“that makes all the difference.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if you _hadn’t_ done them,” the Queen said, “that would have been\\r\\nbetter still; better, and better, and better!” Her voice went higher\\r\\nwith each “better,” till it got quite to a squeak at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was just beginning to say “There’s a mistake somewhere—,” when\\r\\nthe Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence\\r\\nunfinished. “Oh, oh, oh!” shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as\\r\\nif she wanted to shake it off. “My finger’s bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that\\r\\nAlice had to hold both her hands over her ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _is_ the matter?” she said, as soon as there was a chance of\\r\\nmaking herself heard. “Have you pricked your finger?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t pricked it _yet_,” the Queen said, “but I soon shall—oh, oh,\\r\\noh!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When do you expect to do it?” Alice asked, feeling very much inclined\\r\\nto laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I fasten my shawl again,” the poor Queen groaned out: “the brooch\\r\\nwill come undone directly. Oh, oh!” As she said the words the brooch\\r\\nflew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take care!” cried Alice. “You’re holding it all crooked!” And she\\r\\ncaught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the\\r\\nQueen had pricked her finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That accounts for the bleeding, you see,” she said to Alice with a\\r\\nsmile. “Now you understand the way things happen here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why don’t you scream now?” Alice asked, holding her hands ready to\\r\\nput over her ears again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,” said the Queen. “What would\\r\\nbe the good of having it all over again?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time it was getting light. “The crow must have flown away, I\\r\\nthink,” said Alice: “I’m so glad it’s gone. I thought it was the night\\r\\ncoming on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish _I_ could manage to be glad!” the Queen said. “Only I never can\\r\\nremember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and\\r\\nbeing glad whenever you like!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only it is so _very_ lonely here!” Alice said in a melancholy voice;\\r\\nand at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down\\r\\nher cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t go on like that!” cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands\\r\\nin despair. “Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long\\r\\nway you’ve come to-day. Consider what o’clock it is. Consider anything,\\r\\nonly don’t cry!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.\\r\\n“Can _you_ keep from crying by considering things?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the way it’s done,” the Queen said with great decision: “nobody\\r\\ncan do two things at once, you know. Let’s consider your age to begin\\r\\nwith—how old are you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m seven and a half exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You needn’t say ‘exactually,’” the Queen remarked: “I can believe it\\r\\nwithout that. Now I’ll give _you_ something to believe. I’m just one\\r\\nhundred and one, five months and a day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t believe _that_!” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you?” the Queen said in a pitying tone. “Try again: draw a long\\r\\nbreath, and shut your eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice laughed. “There’s no use trying,” she said: “one _can’t_ believe\\r\\nimpossible things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I daresay you haven’t had much practice,” said the Queen. “When I was\\r\\nyour age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve\\r\\nbelieved as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes\\r\\nthe shawl again!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew\\r\\nthe Queen’s shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms\\r\\nagain, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in\\r\\ncatching it for herself. “I’ve got it!” she cried in a triumphant tone.\\r\\n“Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I hope your finger is better now?” Alice said very politely, as\\r\\nshe crossed the little brook after the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, much better!” cried the Queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she\\r\\nwent on. “Much be-etter! Be-etter! Be-e-e-etter! Be-e-ehh!” The last\\r\\nword ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that Alice quite started.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up\\r\\nin wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn’t make out\\r\\nwhat had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really—was it\\r\\nreally a _sheep_ that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub\\r\\nas she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little\\r\\ndark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her\\r\\nwas an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and\\r\\nthen leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it you want to buy?” the Sheep said at last, looking up for a\\r\\nmoment from her knitting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t _quite_ know yet,” Alice said, very gently. “I should like to\\r\\nlook all round me first, if I might.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,” said\\r\\nthe Sheep: “but you can’t look _all_ round you—unless you’ve got eyes\\r\\nat the back of your head.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these, as it happened, Alice had _not_ got: so she contented\\r\\nherself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things—but the\\r\\noddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf,\\r\\nto make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={}, page_content='herself, “I wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of flying\\r\\ninto candles—because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Crawling at your feet,” said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in\\r\\nsome alarm), “you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin\\r\\nslices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump\\r\\nof sugar.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what does _it_ live on?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Weak tea with cream in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA new difficulty came into Alice’s head. “Supposing it couldn’t find\\r\\nany?” she suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it would die, of course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that must happen very often,” Alice remarked thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It always happens,” said the Gnat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat\\r\\namused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it\\r\\nsettled again and remarked, “I suppose you don’t want to lose your\\r\\nname?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed,” Alice said, a little anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet I don’t know,” the Gnat went on in a careless tone: “only\\r\\nthink how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without\\r\\nit! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons,\\r\\nshe would call out ‘come here—,’ and there she would have to leave off,\\r\\nbecause there wouldn’t be any name for her to call, and of course you\\r\\nwouldn’t have to go, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would never do, I’m sure,” said Alice: “the governess would never\\r\\nthink of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn’t remember my\\r\\nname, she’d call me ‘Miss!’ as the servants do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if she said ‘Miss,’ and didn’t say anything more,” the Gnat\\r\\nremarked, “of course you’d miss your lessons. That’s a joke. I wish\\r\\n_you_ had made it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you wish _I_ had made it?” Alice asked. “It’s a very bad one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling\\r\\ndown its cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shouldn’t make jokes,” Alice said, “if it makes you so unhappy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the\\r\\npoor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice\\r\\nlooked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as\\r\\nshe was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and\\r\\nwalked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of\\r\\nit: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a _little_\\r\\ntimid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her\\r\\nmind to go on: “for I certainly won’t go _back_,” she thought to\\r\\nherself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This must be the wood,” she said thoughtfully to herself, “where\\r\\nthings have no names. I wonder what’ll become of _my_ name when I go\\r\\nin? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all—because they’d have to give me\\r\\nanother, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the\\r\\nfun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name!\\r\\nThat’s just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose\\r\\ndogs—‘_answers to the name of “Dash:” had on a brass collar_’—just\\r\\nfancy calling everything you met ‘Alice,’ till one of them answered!\\r\\nOnly they wouldn’t answer at all, if they were wise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked\\r\\nvery cool and shady. “Well, at any rate it’s a great comfort,” she said\\r\\nas she stepped under the trees, “after being so hot, to get into\\r\\nthe—into _what_?” she went on, rather surprised at not being able to\\r\\nthink of the word. “I mean to get under the—under the—under _this_, you\\r\\nknow!” putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. “What _does_ it call\\r\\nitself, I wonder? I do believe it’s got no name—why, to be sure it\\r\\nhasn’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.\\r\\n“Then it really _has_ happened, after all! And now, who am I? I _will_\\r\\nremember, if I can! I’m determined to do it!” But being determined\\r\\ndidn’t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of\\r\\npuzzling, was, “L, I _know_ it begins with L!”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large\\r\\ngentle eyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened. “Here then! Here then!”\\r\\nAlice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it\\r\\nonly started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you call yourself?” the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet\\r\\nvoice it had!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I knew!” thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly,\\r\\n“Nothing, just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think again,” it said: “that won’t do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice thought, but nothing came of it. “Please, would you tell me what\\r\\n_you_ call yourself?” she said timidly. “I think that might help a\\r\\nlittle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you, if you’ll move a little further on,” the Fawn said. “I\\r\\ncan’t remember here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped\\r\\nlovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into\\r\\nanother open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,\\r\\nand shook itself free from Alice’s arms. “I’m a Fawn!” it cried out in\\r\\na voice of delight, “and, dear me! you’re a human child!” A sudden look\\r\\nof alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it\\r\\nhad darted away at full speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at\\r\\nhaving lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. “However, I\\r\\nknow my name now.” she said, “that’s _some_ comfort. Alice—Alice—I\\r\\nwon’t forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to\\r\\nfollow, I wonder?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one\\r\\nroad through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.\\r\\n“I’ll settle it,” Alice said to herself, “when the road divides and\\r\\nthey point different ways.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way,\\r\\nbut wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts\\r\\npointing the same way, one marked “TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE” and the other\\r\\n“TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do believe,” said Alice at last, “that they live in the same house!\\r\\nI wonder I never thought of that before—But I can’t stay there long.\\r\\nI’ll just call and say ‘how d’you do?’ and ask them the way out of the\\r\\nwood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!” So\\r\\nshe wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a\\r\\nsharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she\\r\\ncould not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered\\r\\nherself, feeling sure that they must be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\nTweedledum And Tweedledee\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s\\r\\nneck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them\\r\\nhad “DUM” embroidered on his collar, and the other “DEE.” “I suppose\\r\\nthey’ve each got ‘TWEEDLE’ round at the back of the collar,” she said\\r\\nto herself.')]"
