    "# Week 3:  Acumulators and numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Announcements\n",
    "\n",
    "Some general reminders and points on things for this week:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will often put in extra requirements into the homework text in moodle, and these will be graded requirements. \n",
    "* Even a narrative only answer may still need you to run and deal with code, even if you aren't required to submit any code.\n",
    "* Please read all the hints for each problem that I've given in the homework problems, and reference back to them as you have questions.  There are some where I have given you example outlines for your code solution.\n",
    "* Please start to test your programs that take in inputs.  I've given you some reminders to test your code with many inputs, but I won't have that there the entire semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week's chapter really focuses on numbers, both generating numbers, manipulating their contents, and converting them to suit your needs.  The only math we'll be doing is addition and division.  Nothing more.  Try to focus on understanding the code within the chapter and largely ignore the math that it's trying to talk about.  Along with numbers, the chapter introduces very important pattern that will be in many of your programs:  accumulators and counters.  This is where I'll be focusing my lecture on.  You will still be strongly needing the book with other content.   Any math that you need to know for your homework is explained in the hints area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you are thinking of accumulators and counters, keep them separate in your head.  They're going to look really similar in the code, but their purpose and usage will be very different!  You can have multiple of both inside you program, but commonly you'll have an accumulator to collect up many values, and then a counter to keep track of how many things you have counter.  There is an argument to be made that counters are a special type of accumulator, but I prefer to think of them as siblings rather than parent/child.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be talking about thinking through the application of many of these tools.  Not just how to generate the numbers that you want but how to think through solving problems with numbers and integrating those solutions into larger needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these homework problems, you need to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What kind of for loop do you need?\n",
    "    * Are you repeating a certain number of times, and also don't care about the numbers generated by range()? (this would be a repetition loop)\n",
    "    * Do you need to generate a series of numbers and collect those? (this would be an unpacking loop over range.\n",
    "    * These two will not look much different, but will have one huge difference:  repetition loops will ignore the `i` value generated by that iconic pattern.  Unpacking loops to go over a sequence of numbers WILL use that number, and you'll need to fiddle with the arguments in `range()` to make it generate the numbers that you want.\n",
    "2. Do you need an accumulator (summing up a series of values) or counter (just counting how many times something happens)?\n",
    "3. Which value are you adding up for your accumulator?  Some of these problems have user input that's going into your accumulator.  Some of them will add up your iterable variable value (the thing produced by range in your for loop, if you're doing an unpacking loop with range being your sequence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also pay attention to two key points in this lecture or note them in the patterns as you read them later:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where you put your accumulator or counter base is super important.  The bases need to come before the for loop taking the action of accumulating or counting.  Having your base inside that for loop means you'll erase all your results, and having it after you are trying to count will give you errors about the variable not existing.\n",
    "2.  Where you put your print statements is also vitally important.  You aren't risking erasing your data here, but you are risking making strange outputs that are hiding what is going on.  Your print statements should be outside of your for loop (so after it, and indented to the left.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongly consider using PythonTutor.com to develop your programs in, so you can see how all the values are changing."

    "# The two patterns:  accumulators vs counters\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll note that the words much and many aren't specific here.  So when you are thinking about these questions, think about the complete question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, counting questions can be tricky here.  A counter literally has the name in there, but you may still want to use an accumulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question that you need to ask is:  what am I summing here?  Are you counting a series of uniform values?  Or are you counting up a series of different values?  The variability of the values is a big distinction here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have a class of 24 students.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can count the number of students.**  Each person here counts as \"1\".  This is a uniform value across all entities.  This is the core of a counter pattern.  Inside the loop you'll see that the incrementing value is often hard coded. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We can sum up the total age.** Each person has some age, which may repeat but is variable across everyone in here.  This value must be accessed each time through, and that value is added up to create a final value representing the total number of years old all the students are in this room.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use them together.  If I know a total sum of a property for a set of entities, and the total number of entities, what does that sound like to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we calculate the mean or average value.  So if we've got a loop counting these two things together, we can calculate some summary statistics about it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can you think of some examples of things you might want to count up versus things you might want to sum up? \n",
    "\n",
    "So that's what we can do and how we will be mixing these up together.  Let's take a step back and look at some code for making these things happen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Minimal counter\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal counter will be the easiest to see this mechanism in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting up by a set number\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we want to count how many times a loop executes.  This isn't a trick or anything fancy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our steps to a for loop?  We need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. determine your pattern\n",
    "2. identify your sequence\n",
    "3. give your iterable a good name\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering questions 1 and 2 here often go in circles.  Pick a pattern, think about how it'll work with the sequences available to you, and either rethink or continue forward.  As you build up more experience, you'll know what you need faster and begin to have a set of patterns that you are the most comfortable with.  As you are getting started, take note of the patterns that make the most sense to you and latch onto those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with an range loop, because what we need is to make a for loop that can execute some number of times so that we can count how many times that is.  True, we can run a counter in every type of for loop out there, but let's go with a range loop to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Review a base range loop\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block of code will print \"hello\" five times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to start with this base, and change it so that we are counting how many times this runs.  We know it will be 5 times, but out end goal will be to have a variable holding this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are 4 steps to a counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the 4 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish you base variable at the initial state (usually 0)\n",
    "2. Start a for loop for whatever you're repeating\n",
    "3. Do your stuff, whatever you need to do in that loop\n",
    "4. Update your counter, usually by 1.  This is commonly the last thing in your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "counter = 0 # 1: your counter variable at the initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "for something in sequence: # 2: loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # 3: do all the things\n",
    "    counter = 1 + counter # 4: update the counter, replace 1 and/or the operator with whatever you need\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "My nitpick about the Zelle formula is that it leaves out the `do stuff` item that goes between your for loop and incrementing up your counter variable.  You are often having to do more than just update your counter variable, and many times you need that value in the process.  This means that you'll need to increment up your counter as the last thing you do in your loop. There will be exceptions to this, but they are rare.  More generally, all your incrementers should be at the end of your for loop, and the internal order doesn't always matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example is counting up by 1, but you can always change what that number is or what the operator is.  For example, if you were counting up by 10, you would have 10 in step 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worked example of a counter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: have a base\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's start adapting things.  We need to start with a base.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: have a for loop in there\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to add in our for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    print(\"hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "You see that I haven't changed up the for loop's content, we'll get to that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: do stuff to get the count that you need in that for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often with counters you won't need to do anything here, because you're just brute force counting by a certain number each time.  But this is when you'd address any decision structures or data extraction methods to get out the value that you need to count by.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    # you'd do stuff here\n",
    "    # or maybe you have more counters do do\n",
    "    # either way, all the fun stuff not counter related goes right after the for loop starts\n",
    "    print(\"hello\") # and likely print it out here instead of \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4:  increment up your counter\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've got all our pieces in order and we've done our business, we can finally update our counter.  This is the last step because this is ofter the last thing your for loop.  One of the most common problems that I see is when the increment is put at the beginning of the for loop or in the middle of the action, and everything gets weird.  Almost always it will need to be the last line of code within your for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in range(5):\n",
    "    count = count + 1 #here's the update\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(base)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note our use of `base = base + 1` here.  We are updating a variable that already exists (this is why we define a base), and since we want to reuse it and have the value retained even when the for loop resets, we need to a) keep that base on the outside of our for loop and b) reuse the variable name.  So that repetition of the base variable name is purposeful and absolutely necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if we didn't include the `print()` there at the end?  (nothing would have printed out)\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if the `print(base)` was indented inside the for loop? (we would see a print out for it each time).  Would we see count with the base value of 0?  Would we see count with the final value of 5?  Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Minimal Accumulator:  summing variable/non-uniform values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Think like snow measurement, we say that there is an \"accumulation of 3 inches\".  You don't know how big the individual time moments are (like if it snowed heavily at once or if it was a slow trickle), but you do know the end total of how much snow ended up there.  You can also measure the amount incrementally over time, but once something is added in you can't know how big that individual piece is.\n",
    "\n",
    "An accumulator is highlighted by the incremental value going in being variable in size.  Think of this like a running total where you are only keeping track of the current value, and once an individual value is added in, that value is lost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## There are 5 steps to an accumulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the 5 steps (they should look very familiar to you with the counter steps)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish you accumulator base at the initial state (usually 0)\n",
    "2. Start a for loop for whatever you're repeating\n",
    "3. Do your stuff, whatever you need to do in that loop\n",
    "4. Determine your value to accumulate\n",
    "5. Update your base variable by whatever your incremental value is.  This is commonly the last thing in your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference pattern is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "total_something = 0 # 1: your counter variable at the initial state\n",
    "\n",
    "for something in sequence: # 2: loop over something!\n",
    "    do stuff # 3: do all the things\n",
    "    value_you_want = ?? # 4: determine the value you want to add to your accumulator\n",
    "    total_something = value + total_something # 5: update the counter, replace 1 and/or the operator with whatever you need\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Worked example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's sum up all the numbers produced in a range loop.  Yes, this is as silly example, but it keeps the clutter away so you can see the inner workings better.\n",

    "Write a program that prints out just the first line of each stanza in the raven, but these lines should be collected into a single string (a common need when writing results out to a file).\n",

    "2. Exploit the known structure of the poem and do a little math about where each stanza should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's start with the second option and see if this exploit will do the trick for us.  Hopefully it will and we can avoid some complication about the true meaning of a stanza.\n",

    "## First question:  what is the granularity of our question?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, are we concerned about characters, words, lines, larger chunks, entire files, etc?  Answering this question will help you slim down your choices of which patterns, functions, and tools will be helpful. This is also how you should internally organize these things in your head.\n",

This means that we would need to figure out how to define a stanza from a technical perspective.  Which we can, but isn't entirely necessary.  We'll explore how to do this in later weeks.\n",
    "\n",
