So in recent, in recent, for my whole semester I have been assigned the role of a leader. I have been leading my group since the start of the first semester as as I researched earlier regarding this degree so I guided everyone in my class to what to do and I got it my group I told them the skills to learn I told I guided them how to get good at programming so this is how I demonstrated my leadership skills and apart from that why should I think you should have me because I'm currently the best fit for you I have worked with numerous organizations and I have experience but what separates me from other candidates is that I have expertise in both machine learning and development so a person for example if I have to integrate in model in my web I would I would know because I can do that easily because I have expertise in both web and web application with that my final year project that was a specific role was based on both it was a full stack website but I had few models of ML that included speech recognition\n"

I have been leading my group since the start of the first semester as as we researched earlier regarding this degree so I guided everyone in my class to what to do and I got it my group I told them the skills to learn I told I guided them how to get good at programming so this is how I demonstrated my leadership skills and apart from that why should I think you should have me because I'm currently the best fit for you I have worked with numerous organizations and I have experience but what separates me from other candidates is that I have expertise in both machine learning and development so a person for example if I have to integrate in model in my web I would I would know because I can do that easily because I have expertise in both web and web application with that my final year project that was a specific role was based on both it was a full stack website but I had few models of ML that included speech recognition\n",
