    "# Notes for Instructors\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is designed to be done with small groups of students who are inexperienced in programming in general, but have some ideas about statistics.  If the students have got some experience with programming, then it should be possible to do with a far larger student to teacher ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1a\n",
    "This is a basic introductory question, which will introduce students to the idea of using Python to program.  Note that we are using Python 3 rather than Python 2, the main difference to be aware of, is that `print \"Hello!\"` will not work, but instead will need to use `print(\"Hello!\")` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the exercise should take the longest, since it requires explaining quite a lot of syntax, and some of the ideas behind programming in Python.  For students who are already experienced at programming, there is a harder alternative which they may find more interesting.\n",
    " \n",
    "### \"Magic\" functions\n",
    "At the top, we have two functions `get_data()` and `get_arrival_time()`.  The way that a function is defined in Python is by using the word `def` followed by the name of the function.  The students do not need to understand how the functcions work, they can be considered to be \"magic\".  What they do, is they open files which contain the data, and return the data in a structure which makes it easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare to a black box mathematical function like `f(x) = 2x`.  The input in the case of the mathematical function is a number, which would then provide the output.  So `f(2) = 4`.  Functions in programming are an extension of this, in that they can accept many different sorts of inputs, such as text, dates etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of other parts of programming described below can also be considered to be \"magic\".  Everything in programming is simply an abstraction away from a series of `0`s and `1`s.  There are many different ways of doing this, just like we do for solving mathematical problems or communicating with people.  Python is a \"high level\" programming language, it uses a lower level language (C) and abstracts away a lot of things such as accesing memory, implements some useful data structures for us, and makes strings a lot less painful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Within the two functions, you will see comments in two different formats.  Firstly, comments like this: `\"\"\"This is a comment\"\"\"` and comments which are prepended by `#`.  In Python, the convention is to use `\"\"\"` comments called docstrings for defining the function behaviour, and lines prepended by `#` can be used for explaining bits of code.  Students can look at the docstring in the functions to get information about how to call the function, and the values that it returns:\n"

A simple example is below, which prints the value of the variable:"

    "#### Types of Variable\n",
    "In that example, we see three types of variable: An integer variable `x`, a string which is being passed as a parameter to the print function, and a float `y`.  A string is any combination of numbers or letters, and is surrounded by either `\"\"` or `''`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `%d`, we are able to output the value of an integer.  There are different values which we can use for different types of variables.  `%s` is used for a string, and `%f` is used for a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "A float is another simple type, it is just a number which is not an integer, for example `y = 4.3`.  These are less accurate than integers, but we will need to use them in this exercise, because the data are not whole numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other type of variable we need to know about is booleans, which have two values: `True` and `False`.  We use these to test to see whether a condition is true, usually to decide whether to execute a certain bit of code.  That is the control flow of a program, we can use an `if` test.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If that is `False`, we can do another test with a different condition using `elif`.  This is optional, and most of the time we won't use this.  We `else` if there are no other options we want to test for, and run the code instead."
