    "## Syntax of Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, anonymous function (lambda function) is a function that is defined without a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "While normal functions are defined using the **def** keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the **lambda** keyword. Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> S = lambda a, b: a + b\n",
    ">>> S(5, 7)\n",
    "    12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> double = lambda x: x * 2\n",
    ">>> double(5)\n",
    "    10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above program, **lambda x: x * 2** is the `lambda function`. Here **x** is the argument and **x * 2** is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has no name. It returns a function object which is assigned to the identifier **double**. We can now call it as a normal function. The statement\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "double = lambda x: x * 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is nearly the same as\n",

    "## Use of Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we generally use it as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes in other functions as [arguments](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function-argument)). Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like `filter()`, `map()` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use with filter()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **filter()** function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items for which the function evaluats to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example use of filter() function to filter out only even numbers from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> def is_odd(x):\n",
    ">>>     return x % 2 == 0\n",

    "```\n",

    "* Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks.\n",
    "* If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make sure you have terminated the string properly. An unterminated string may cause an invalid token error at the end of your program, or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not produce an error message at all!\n",
