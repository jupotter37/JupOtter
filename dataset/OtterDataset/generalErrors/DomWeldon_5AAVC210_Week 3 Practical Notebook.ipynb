    "# Week 3: Complex Types, Exceptions and Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to week 3! Building on the material from last week, you're now all programmers, and you should be able to comfortably and confidently write simple programs in python to tackle interesting problems. Let's recap over some of the different things we can do now in our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assign values to variables and perform arithmetical operations on them.\n",
    "* Print out values.\n",
    "* Take values from the user and cast them to different types.\n",
    "* Use the following types: `int`, `str`, `float`, `None` and `bool`; and determine the type of an object using `type()`.\n",
    "* Define a function.\n",
    "* Conditionally execute code depending on comparisons between different variables, and use boolean logic to compare more than two things at once.\n",
    "* Repeat some code as many times as we like, or until some condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, so far our programs have been rather limited in terms of what they've been, for want of a better word, 'about.' We've taken values from a user, but we've only ever taken one value at a time, and whilst we've been able to make comparisons about variables, our variables have been quite limited and specific (`egg_count`, `ham_count`, etc.). This week, we're going to increase the scope and complexity of what our programs can achieve by starting to use complex types (i.e., types which consist of more than one thing - more on this later), and start to make the structure of our programs more powerful by handling errors, and using iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Week's Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this week, you should be able to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand how Python treats names, and have an insight into the 'Zen of Python'\n",
    "* Use the complex types `tuple`, `dict` and `list`, understand their use cases, and the distinctions between them.\n",
    "* Write programs which iteratre over tuples, dictionaries and lists.\n",
    "* Know the difference between a key and an index, and understand the distinction between a `KeyError` and an `IndexError`.\n",
    "* Use the `try` / `except` structure to catch errors and understand why this is useful.\n",
    "* Use standard methods on simple and complex types, especially string methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is structured such that we cover a lot of material in the first four weeks of the course, allowing more time to cover more advanced material which will be important for your final 50% assessment.

    "When we assign a variable, like `a = 10`, rather than just \"storing\" a value, what we're really saying to python, and so what python is saying to our computer, is *\"remember the integer `10` and put it into my code anywhere I write `a`\"*. The computer remembers this value in its *memory*, or RAM. This memory is just a very large collection of \"switches\" which can be either on (to store a 1), or off (to store a 0). In the very early days of computing these switches were [very large physical valves and relays](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Harwell-dekatron-witch-computer-under-resotoration-2010-03-13.jpg) or other magnetic devices, whereas nowadays they are tiny transistors or capacitators. \n",

A typical computer may have about 8GB of memory, whilst higher performance computers can have significantly more. A computer will store an integer in a piece of memory either 32-bits or 64-bits long (if you've ever wondered what we mean by a '64-bit computer', this is it). That means that in order to store our integer when we assign `a = 10`, the computer needs to find 64 bits in its memory and store the number there, and then, whenever it sees `a` in a bit of code, remember where (amongst the billions of bits) in its memory it stored that value and then go back to it. The way python does this is to assign a **name** to a **location in its memory** and then use this name as a pointer to this bit of memory elsewhere in the code.\n",
