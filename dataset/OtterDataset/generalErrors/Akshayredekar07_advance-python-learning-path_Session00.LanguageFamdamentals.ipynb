    "### Identifiers in Python (Key Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A name in a Python program, used as a class, function, module, or variable name (e.g., `a = 10`).\n",
    "- **Rules for Defining Identifiers:**\n",
    "  1. Allowed characters:  \n",
    "     - Alphabets (lowercase or uppercase), digits (0-9), and underscore (`_`).  \n",
    "     - Using symbols like `$` causes a syntax error.  \n",
    "     - Examples:  \n",
    "       - Valid: `cash = 10`  \n",
    "       - Invalid: `ca$h = 20`  \n",
    "  2. Must not start with a digit.  \n",
    "     - Examples:  \n",
    "       - Invalid: `123total`  \n",
    "       - Valid: `total123`  \n",
    "  3. Case-sensitive.  \n",
    "     - Examples:  \n",
    "       - `total = 10`, `TOTAL = 999`.  \n",
    "       - `print(total)` outputs `10`.  \n",
    "       - `print(TOTAL)` outputs `999`.  \n",
    "  4. Identifiers starting with `_`:  \n",
    "     - Single `_`: Indicates private identifiers.  \n",
    "     - Double `__`: Strongly private identifiers.  \n",
    "     - Double underscores at both ends: Language-defined special names (e.g., `__add__`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Additional Rules:**\n",
    "  - Reserved words cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., `def = 10` is invalid).  \n",
    "  - No length limit for identifiers, but overly lengthy names are discouraged.  \n",
    "  - The `$` symbol is not allowed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples of Valid and Invalid Identifiers:**  \n",
    "  1. `123total` → ❌  \n",
    "  2. `total123` → ✅  \n",
    "  3. `java2share` → ✅  \n",

    "  6. `def` → ❌ (reserved word)  \n",
    "  7. `if` → ❌ (reserved word)  \n",

    "### String Data Type (`str`)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `str` data type is used to represent strings, which are sequences of characters. These characters can include letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, etc. Strings are enclosed in **single quotes (' ')** or **double quotes (\" \")**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s1 = 'durga'\n",
    "s2 = \"durga\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both of these are valid string assignments. There's no difference in behavior between single and double quotes. However, you might choose one over the other to avoid conflicts when using quotes inside the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-line Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings enclosed by **single** or **double quotes** cannot span multiple lines. For multi-line strings, Python provides **triple quotes** (either single `'''` or double `\"\"\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s1 = '''durga soft'''\n",
    "s2 = \"\"\"durga soft\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can use triple quotes to define a string that spans multiple lines, making it easier to handle longer text blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example with embedded quotes:\n",
    "You can also use triple quotes to include **single quotes** or **double quotes** in the string without escaping them.\n",

    "### Slicing of Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "**String slicing** allows you to extract parts of a string. Python uses the **slice operator** (`[ ]`) for this purpose, and the string follows a **zero-based index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing:\n",
    "- Positive indices count from left to right (starting at `0`).\n",
    "- Negative indices count from right to left (starting at `-1`).\n",
    "\n",

    "print(s[1])  # 'u'  (Second character)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to access an index that's out of range, Python will raise an `IndexError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(s[40])  # IndexError: string index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slicing Syntax: `[start:end]`\n",
    "- **Start** is the index where slicing begins (inclusive).\n",
    "- **End** is the index where slicing ends (exclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit **start** or **end**, Python will assume defaults:\n",
    "- If you omit **start**, it will default to `0` (beginning of the string).\n",
    "- If you omit **end**, it will default to the string's length (the entire string).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(s[1:40])  # 'urga' (Index from 1 to end of string)\n",
    "print(s[1:])    # 'urga' (From index 1 to the end)\n",
    "print(s[:4])    # 'durg' (From start to index 3)\n",
    "print(s[:])     # 'durga' (Whole string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### String Operations:\n",
    "- **Repeating a string** using `*`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(s * 3)  # 'durgadurgadurga'\n",

    "### Fundamental Data Types vs Immutability \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Immutability**:\n",
    "   - All fundamental data types in Python (e.g., `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) are **immutable**.\n",
    "   - This means the value of an object cannot be modified once it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Python uses a memory optimization technique to reuse existing objects with the same value.\n",
    "   - This improves memory utilization and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why Immutability?**:\n",
    "   - Immutability prevents unwanted side effects when multiple references point to the same object.\n",
    "   - Modifying one reference would affect the others, which could lead to unintended behavior.\n",
    "   - Immutability ensures that the value of an object cannot be changed once it is created, avoiding this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Example Demonstrations**:\n",
    "   - **Creating same values**: Python reuses the same object for the same value (`a = 10` and `b = 10` refer to the same object).\n",
    "   - **Complex Number**: Complex numbers are immutable but not reused (each `a = 10 + 5j` and `b = 10 + 5j` creates a new object).\n",
    "   - **Boolean values**: Python reuses the same objects for `True` and `False` (`a = True` and `b = True` refer to the same object).\n",
    "   - **String literals**: Strings are immutable and often reused due to this property (`a = 'durga'` and `b = 'durga'` refer to the same object).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Key Takeaway**:\n",
    "   - Immutability ensures that once a fundamental data type is assigned a value, it cannot be altered, preventing unintended side effects from modifying the same object in multiple places.\n",
