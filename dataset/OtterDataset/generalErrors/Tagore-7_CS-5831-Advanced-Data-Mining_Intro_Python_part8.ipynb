For three constructs, if-statements, loops and function invocations, this sequential execution is interrupted.\n",

        "* For *function invocations*, flow-of-control jumps to the first statement in  the called function, the function is executed, and the flow-of-control  jumps back to the next statement after the function call.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's suppose that a program contains complex logic that is appropriately subdivided into functions. The program is running and it currently is executing function D, which was called by function C, which was called by function B, which was called by function A, which was called from the main function. This is illustrated by the following simplistic code example:\n",
        "\n",

However, all that function D can do using normal flow-of-control is to return a value to function C. So function D returns a special value to function C that means \"try something else\". Function C has to recognize this value, quit its processing, and return the special value to function B. And so forth and so on. It would be very helpful if function D could communicate directly with the main function (or functions A and B) without sending a special value through the intermediate calling functions. Well, that is exactly what an *exception* does. An *exception* is a message to any function currently on the executing program's \"run-time-stack\". (The \"run-time-stack\" is what keeps track of the active function calls while a program is executing.)\n",

A ``try: except:`` block is used to say \"hey, I can deal with that message.\" The first ``try: except:`` block that Python finds on its search back up the run-time-stack will be executed. If there is no ``try: except:`` block found, the program \"crashes\" and prints its run-time-stack to the console.\n",
