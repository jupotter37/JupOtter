Python, like any other language has a certain syntax, which we need to stick to in order for Python to understand your code. Whenever we violate this syntactic structure we get a SyntaxError.\n",
    "- **NameError:** NameErrors occur when we try to access the value of a variable/an object that we haven't even defined yet. It's like talking to your family about some fellow student of yours that they don't know. \"Yesterday, I went binge-drinking with Tonya.\" Of course, their response will be \"Who is Tonya?\". Well, Python will ask you the same question when referring to an object that you have never introduced.\n",
    "- **IndexError:** We can cause an IndexError when trying to access an element in an subscriptable object (basically objects that are containers which allow for indexing at all) that does not exist. For example, we would cause an IndexError by asking Python to return the value of the 6th element of a list that is only 3 elements long.\n",
    "- **TypeError:** TypeErrors occur whenever we try to do some operation with a data type that just doesn't fit the operation, like trying to do something with two strings that can only be done with two integers or floats. \n",
    "- **KeyError:** These errors usually occur, when we try to access the value of a key, although the key does not exist in the dictionary.\n",
