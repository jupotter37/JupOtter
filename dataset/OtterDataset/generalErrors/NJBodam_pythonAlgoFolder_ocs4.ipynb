    "in wordlewords.txt, all words are directly after each other, so you have to read repeatedly 5 letter until all words are read.\n",
    "in wordlewordsinLines.txt, each word is in a separate line. So you can read them with a for-loop.\n",
    "First, design the overall workflow of your script and define functions to keep the code readable.\n",
