    "## Identifying special characters\n",
    "The previous categorization only distinguishes between alphabetic characters and numeric characters using the respective string methods `isalpha()` and `isnumeric()`. Unfortunately, checking a string for special characters such as `\"!\"`, `\"?\"` etc... is not implemented as a string method ([source](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)). The solution to this problem is to assume that any character that is neither alphabetic nor numeric must be a special character. In Python you can implement this using an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement. The following code snippet shows how you could check if the password is between 8 and 16 characters long\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if len(password) < 8:\n",
    "    print(\"The password is too short\")\n",
    "elif len(password) > 16:\n",
    "    print(\"The password is too long\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The password has a valid length\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The keyword `elif` is supposed to be a combination of `else` and `if`. It allows you to check a second condition if the first condition was `False`. In general, you can use any number of `elif` statements, even no `elif` statement at all. If you only want to check one condition, you can omit the `elif` statement and just use `if` and `else`. As you (implicitely) learned in an earlier exercise, the `else` statement is also optional. If you don't need to handle the case where the initial condition is `False`, it is perfectly fine to just use the `if` statement.\n",

    "- Iterate over the characters in the password and use an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement to sort the characters into the three categories. There should be no character missing from the three lists this time.\n",
    "- Compute the lengths of the three lists and compare them to the length of the password to confirm that no characters are missing this time.\n",

    "## Interrupting for loops\n",
    "The `for` loops you have used in the exercises so far all had a predefined range. You could therefore know how many times the loop would run before actually executing the code. In some cases it can be useful to interrupt a loop during the iteration if the loop has already served its purpose. In a `for` loop you can do this with the keyword `break`. See the following code snippet that will stop the iteration of the password when a numeric character is found:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for character in password:\n",
    "    if character.isnumeric():\n",
    "        print(\"I found a numeric character in the password.\")\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "Instead of interrupting the `for` loop, you could have also stored all numeric characters in a list (as you have done in earlier exercises). Computing the length of the list will then tell you if there are numeric characters in the password. While the result of the two approaches will be the same, the interrupted `for` loop can be a lot more efficient. You don't have to keep an additional list of characters and you don't have to finish the iteration if you have already found a numeric character. For a single password this will not make a noticeable difference but if you run the code on millions of passwords, this will definitely have an impact on the runtime (and the required resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if a password contains at least two special characters with a list comprehension or the regular (uninterrupted) `for` loop.\n",
    "- Write an interrupted `for` loop to check the same requirement. You can use an integer variable to keep track of the number of special characters.\n",
    "- Use the function `enumerate()` to keep track of the number of iterations of the interrupted `for` loop. Check that the loop really stops as early as you would expect it to."

    "## EXTRA: Making a password more secure\n",
    "This exercise is a follow-up to the first \"EXTRA\" exercise about improving the password policy. Make sure to solve this one before starting this exercise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The password policy in this exercise uses mixed requirements from the earlier two password policies. If you want to make this exercise easier/more difficult, you can slightly modify the requirements to your liking. E.g. you can add the maximum allowed length of 16 or you can drop the numeric character requirement.\n",
    "1. The length of the password must be at least 8 characters\n",
    "2. The password must contain lower-case characters and upper-case characters\n",
    "3. The password must contain at least one numeric character\n",
    "\n",
    "If a password is not considered to be secure enough, it would be convenient to have an algorithm that automatically modifies the password to meet the security requirements. Just appending `\"aA1\"` to every password to meet the latter two requirements would be too easy to crack. The modification(s) should therefore depend on the original password. You can do this with the string methods that are built into Python. For a list of available methods see https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp or just find a list online.  \n",
    "Since strings cannot be modified in place in Python (they are immutable) the best approach is to work with a list of the individual characters. You can then replace/modify the characters by assigning a new/modified character to the corresponding index in the list. After the modification(s) you can turn the list of characters into a string again with the method `\"\".join()`. See the following code snippet as an illustration. In the password `\"hello\"` the character `\"e\"` is manually replaced by the character `\"3\"` to fulfill the numeric requirement:\n",

Nevertheless, it's a good exercise on working with strings.\n",

    "- If there is no lower/upper-case character, replace the first suitable character with its upper/lower-case counterpart.\n",
    "- If there is no numeric character, replace the first suitable character (lower-case or upper-case) by its [leet-speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet#Table_of_leet-speak_substitutes_for_normal_letters) counterpart. The most common options are `E->3, S->5, B->8, I->1, A->4`.\n",

    "To test your password modification you can try the cases from the table below. Copy the initial password from the table and check if your modified password looks the same. Some of the impossible modifications assume that only the \"most common\" numeric replacements from the exercise are used. If you included more replacments, the modification might be possible anyway.  \n",
