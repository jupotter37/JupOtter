    "# Data Visualization I: Intro to Plotting Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll discuss what plotting capabilities are available with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We'll combine a cherry-picking of features that will allow you to create common plots with elegance, but relative ease. Here is a summary of points we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A review of qualitative data viz best practices\n",
    "* The anatomy of a plot and the building blocks of data visualizations\n",
    "* Styling with Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief review of the key points about data visualization & storytelling from the \"Data Science Foundations\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualizations serve to quickly explain features and conclusions about data to your stakeholders.\n",
    "* As such, they should be *simple*, *uncluttered*, and *clearly labeled*. Less is more.\n",
    "* Visual considerations include position, color, order, & size.\n",
    "* The best visualizations tell a story about the data by illustrating key points supporting your thesis and conclusions.\n",
    "* Most importantly, *consider your audience* when crafting your story.\n",
    "* The chart type you select should accurately represent the variables you are pulling from data in a way that is clearly readable for your audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro to Plotting Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with where the different libraries fit in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matplotlib is the foundational data viz library in Python. Plotting functionality in other libraries is built on top of Matplotlib. Matplotlib is vastly flexible, but also quite complex. \n",
    "* Pandas plotting capabilities are limited to the basics. Pandas provides a way to plot using your Series or DataFrame object as a base. (We'll explain that shortly). Any bells and whistles require you to incorporate Matplotlib.\n",
    "* Seaborn specializes in statistical visualizations. It simplifies the creation of a collection of statistical plots, but it lacks some of the customization options that Matplotlib provides.\n"

    "* The **Figure** encompasses the axes as well as all its accompanying parts, i.e. the title, the legend, axis labels, etc.\n",
    "* If you have a grid/matrix of graphs in a single figure, we call each cell in the grid a **Subplot**. \n",
    "* When you create a subplot, it automatically creates an **Axes** object. This is where the data actually gets graphed.\n",
    "* Spines refer to the outlines of the axes (bottom (x-axis), left (y-axis), top, and right)\n",
    "* **Ticks** are the periodic marks on the x and y axes.\n",
    "* You should also include a **Title** and **Labels** for the x and y axes. \n",
    "* A **Legend** (not pictured above) is used to define  different colors or shapes on a single graph as different categories or segments of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Matplotlib, many of the above objects must be created manually BEFORE plotting the data. With Pandas and Seaborn, often the figure, axes, and even the labels are created implicitly when you plot the data. \n",
