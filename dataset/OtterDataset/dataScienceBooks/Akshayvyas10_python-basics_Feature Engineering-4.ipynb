    "Data encoding is a process of converting categorical data into a numerical format that can be understood by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "This is essential because most machine learning algorithms are designed to work with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of data encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding: Each category is represented by a binary vector where only one element is 1, and the rest are 0.\n",
    "Label encoding: Each category is assigned a unique numerical label.\n",
    "Ordinal encoding: Categories are assigned numerical values based on their order or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why data encoding is useful in data science:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility with algorithms: Most machine learning algorithms require numerical data.\n",
    "Improved model performance: Proper data encoding can help models learn patterns and relationships more effectively.\n",
    "Handling categorical variables: Categorical variables, which cannot be directly processed by many algorithms, can be transformed into a suitable format using encoding.\n",
    "Avoiding bias: Encoding techniques can help prevent bias in models by ensuring that categorical variables are treated fairly.\n",

    "Consider a dataset with a categorical feature \"Color\" with possible values: \"Red\", \"Green\", and \"Blue\".\n",
