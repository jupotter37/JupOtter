Portland's newest bridge, the *Tilikum Crossing,* opened in 2015, and is highly multimodal,  allowing travel for pedestrians, bikes, electric scooters, trains, streetcars, and buses (but the modality of travel by personal car is missing). Bike lanes were not an afterthought, but rather an integral part of the bridge  design. One therefore expects to see a good amount of bike traffic on Tilikum.  \n",
