Regular expressions can be found in all modern programming languages and many text editing software tools. For paedological and practical purposes, we'll be using Python. But remember that most of what you learn in this workshop will carry across to any environment in which regular expressions are available."

    "Regular expressions are of both theoretical and practical interest in computer science. For the theoretical side, see the [Wikipedia page on regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) and [on regular langauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). For our purposes, a regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. We can use regular expressions to find particular patterns in text data. The text data could be an English sentence, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, Python source code, or anything you like. Once we've found a particular pattern, we can optionally replace it with some other text. **In this way, regular expressions are really just advanced \"find and replace\" techniques.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tasks you can achieve easily and quickly with regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extract all words within parentheses in a text file\n",
    "* Find all products on a webpage that cost over \\$250\n",
    "* Replace swear words with family-friendly alternatives\n",
    "* Extract all the dates and times in a document\n",
    "* Locate all the phone numbers in a series of emails\n",
    "* Find all words regardless of whether they are singular or plural, or past, present or future tense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are some situations in your work where regular expressions would be useful?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we use regular expressions when we know have a large corpus of text data, and we know the data we want to extract follows specific rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(.*)`\n",
    "* `family|ies`\n",
    "* `fu+c?k`\n",
    "* `n|a|b`\n",
    "* `one`\n",
    "* `$\\d+`\n",
    "* `after.$`\n",
    "* `the (\\w)er .*, the (\\w)er .*`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of regular expressions as a tiny, highly specialized programming language. This \"tiny, highly specialized programming language\" is available in Python, R, C, Excel, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, vim, emacs, notepad++, etc. To use regular expressions, we have to learn their syntax, just like you did when you learnt Python or R syntax. In fact, **learning to use regular expressions is 95% learning the syntax.** You can learn the whole syntax for regular expressions in a few hours, although becoming proficient will probably take a few hours of practice. The awesome thing about regular expressions is that their syntax is almost entirely identical across different programming languages. All the patterns we wrote above match the same patterns regardless of where you're using them. In this workshop, we'll be using Python. **But bear in mind, the regular expression syntax we learn today isn't unique to Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about regular expressions is that they define a set of strings. For example, it might be the set of all possible URLs, or the set of all possible social security numbers. In a sense, you can think of the regular expression like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\\d{3}-\\d{2}-\\d{4}` = `{123-45-6789, 123-45-6780, 123-45-6781, ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are useful because they are a concise way of representing the set of strings you care about. We can use the regular expression above to search for any strings in our data that are in that set. Another way to say that is that we search for strings in our data that **match the regular expression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One last note on terminology. Regular expressions are also called regexes, regex patterns or REs."
