    "Before we dive into the data, let's consider briefly what logistic regression is, and its utility in health data science...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic regression** is a form of *generalised linear modelling*. It uses a number of parameters ($X_i$) to determine a discrete outcome, $Y$ e.g. disease vs no disease, side effect vs no side effect, treatment vs no treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest logistic model relates one covariate (X) to one outcome (Y) which is either present or absent. Logistic regression then calculates the probability of the outcome Y given a certain value X. This can be written simply as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Y = \\beta0 + \\beta1X $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where $ \\beta0 $ and $ \\beta1 $ are coefficients which influence the outcome Y\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Link Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **link function** is the function used to link the probability with the above model. For a logistic regression, the link funcition is also called the **logit function**, which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ logit(\\pi) = log(\\pi / 1-\\pi) $\n",
    "\n",
    "From this link function, we can therefore transform $logit(\\pi)$ to find $\\pi$, the probability, with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "If: $ logit(\\pi) = L $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\pi = exp(L)/(1 + exp(L)) $\n",
    "\n",
    "We will return to how the link function is applied to Logistic Regression later in this notebook."

    "A common way to represent a *significant* relationship is the p-value. The p-value represents the probability of observing the outcome given the null hypothesis, which is that there is no association between $X$ and $Y$. We typically say that, if the probability of observing our data, given the null hypothesis, is less than 0.05, that this gives us sufficient evidence to reject this hypothesis.\n",

Given the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in odds of LOS >100 days for severity of illness, P>|z| which represent p-values give us strong evidence to reject this null hypothesis.
