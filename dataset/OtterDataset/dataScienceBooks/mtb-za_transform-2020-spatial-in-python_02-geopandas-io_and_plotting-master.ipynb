    "# Intro to Geopandas plotting vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "DATE: 12 June 2020, 08:00 - 11:00 UTC\n",
    "\n",
    "AUDIENCE: Intermediate\n",

    "INSTRUCTOR: Martin Bentley, Digital Geoscientist, [Agile](https://agilescientific.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the data that we want to deal with is simply numeric. Much of it will need to be located in space as well. Luckily, there are numerous tools to handle this sort of data. For this notebook, we will focus on vector data. This is data consisting of points, lines and polygons, not gridded data. The tutorials by Leo Uieda and Joe Kington deal more with raster data and should be a good complement to this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of common spatial tasks that are often done in GIS software, such as adding buffers to data, or manipulating and creating geometries. This notebook is focused more on the basics of using existing data and plotting it, but not making many changes specific to spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be reasonably comfortable with `pandas` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, this is aimed at relative beginners to working with spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Note on Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapefiles are a common file format used when sharing and storing georeferenced data. A single shapefile has a number of components that are required for it to work correctly.\n",
    "These are mandatory:\n",
    "- `<name>.shp` the feature geometry.\n",
    "- `<name>.shx` is the shape index.\n",
    "- `<name>.dbx` contains the attributes in columns, for each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of additional files that may also be present, of which these are the most common (in the author's experience).\n",
    "- `<name>.prj` is the projection of the data.\n",
    "- `<name>.sbx` and `<name>.sbn` are a spatial index.\n",
    "- `<name>.shp.xml` is a metadata file.\n",
    "\n",
    "While shapefiles are very common on desktop systems, they tend not to be used present data on the web, although they are often offered as a download option."

    "\n",
    "Pandas gives us access to a data structure called a DataFrame, which is very well suited for the sort of data that is usually in spreadsheets, with rows and columns. Geopandas is an expansion of that, to allow for the data to be geographically located in a sensible way. It does this by adding a `geometry` column, a , and adding some methods for some spatially useful tests, while still allowing the usual `DataFrame` methods from pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will use `cartopy` to handle projections. `mapclassify` is optional, but allows easy binning of our data."
