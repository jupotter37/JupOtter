    "Data science is a fast-growing field. To catch up, data scientists have to keep learning, e.g., by reading/writing blog posts. Most data scientists have the habit of reading blog posts. However, very few data scientists have the habit of writing blog posts. There are many advantages to write blog posts. First, it can train your communication skills.  Second, it can help you gain a deep understanding of what you write. Third, it may make you become more well known in the data science community. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given these advantages, we created this [SFU Big Data Publication](https://medium.com/sfu-big-data) on Medium. We hope that through this exercise, you will get familiar with how to write an excellent blog post, and form the habit of writing blog posts regularly.  \n",

    "* What can I do to make my blog post more easy to understand? \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first question, here are some tricks: (1) come up with an attractive blog title (see [this page](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/a-simple-formula-for-writing-kick-ass-titles-ht#sm.0000072w4nzrqmfn2vwd6y30afmyo) for some tips); (2) pay great attention to the first paragraph of your blog post (See [this page](https://problogger.com/10-tips-for-opening-your-next-blog-post/) for some tips); (2) add a couple of attractive images but make sure they are related to your blog post. \n",

    "For the second question, here are some tricks: (1) avoid using jargon (if you have to, please first explain them in simple words); (2) use examples and figures to illustrate complicate stuff; (3) leverage the power of analogies. \n",
