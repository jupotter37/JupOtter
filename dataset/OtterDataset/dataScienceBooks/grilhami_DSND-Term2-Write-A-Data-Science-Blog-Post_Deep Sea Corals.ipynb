    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "While many people has considered the space as the \"final frontier\", I considered the ocean as the \"forgotten frontier\" that we have yet to explore here on earth. I mean we have more people who have been to the moon than to the Mariana Trench - the deepest part of the oceans. There is so much we don't know about the ocean. Although the surface area of the Pacific Ocean is wider than the moon, according to the NOAA, more than 80% of the world's vast underwater oceans are still unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing all of that, I think it only make sense for use to get to know more about our own ocean. Why is it so important? I thinkg it's better to let the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explain to you in this page; but for me personally it's about the technological aspect. There are so many things we've invented thanks to the scientists and engineers who helped sent people to the moon. For example, the portable computer, wireless headphones, LEDs, and much more. If we could develop such wonderful stuff from space exploration, imagine what we could discovered from exploring the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use the NOAA deep-sea coral dataset to....wait for it...build a coastal research resort. The long-term goal of the research resort is to provide a suitable location for Mariana Trench realted missions; but for the short-term goal, we want to provide suitable location and facilities for deep-sea coral research. Why Mariana Trench? And whar does it have to do with corals? Well I think it would be better for you you to read my medium blog about this project. It will come out soon, so make sure you stay tune.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset contains information about deep sea corals and sponges collected by NOAA and NOAA’s partners. Amongst the data are geo locations of deep sea corals and sponges and the whole thing is tailored to the occurrences of azooxanthellates - a subset of all corals and all sponge species (i.e. they don't have symbiotic relationships with certain microbes). Additionally, these records only consists of observations deeper than 50 meters to truly focus on the deep sea corals and sponges.\n",

    "Column descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CatalogNumber: Unique record identifier assigned by the Deep-Sea Coral Research and Technology Program.\n",
    "- DataProvider: The institution, publication, or individual who ultimately deserves credit for acquiring or aggregating the data and making it available.\n",
    "- ScientificName: Taxonomic identification of the sample as a Latin binomial.\n",
    "- VernacularNameCategory: Common (vernacular) name category of the organism.\n",
    "- TaxonRank: Identifies the level in the taxonomic hierarchy of the ScientificName term.\n",
    "- ObservationDate: Time as hh:mm:ss when the sample/observation occurred (UTC).\n",
    "- Latitude (degrees North): Latitude in decimal degrees where the sample or observation was collected.\n",
    "- Longitude (degrees East): Longitude in decimal degrees where the sample or observation was collected.\n",
    "- DepthInMeters: Best single depth value for sample as a positive value in meters.\n",
    "- DepthMethod: Method by which best singular depth in meters (DepthInMeters) was determined. \"Averaged\" when start and stop depths were averaged. \"Assigned\" when depth was derived from bathymetry at the location. \"Reported\" when depth was reported based on instrumentation or described in literature.\n",
    "- Locality: A specific named place or named feature of origin for the specimen or observation (e.g., Dixon Entrance, Diaphus Bank, or Sur Ridge). Multiple locality names can be separated by a semicolon, arranged in a list from largest to smallest area (e.g., Gulf of Mexico; West Florida Shelf, Pulley Ridge).\n",
    "- IdentificationQualifier: Taxonomic identification method and level of expertise. Examples: “genetic ID”; “morphological ID from sample by taxonomic expert”; “ID by expert from image”; “ID by non-expert from video”; etc.\n",
    "- SamplingEquipment: Method of data collection. Examples: ROV, submersible, towed camera, SCUBA, etc.\n",
    "- RecordType: Denotes the origin and type of record. published literature (\"literature\"); a collected specimen (\"specimen\"); observation from a still image (\"still image\"); observation from video (\"video observation\"); notation without a specimen or image (\"notation\"); or observation from trawl surveys, longline surveys, and/or observer records (\"catch record\").\n",

    "Okay, there some stuff we need to talk about here.\n",

    "First of all, it seems that ROVs have actually been the prefered choice of observing deep-sea corals over the year. However, I'm interested to know why is there a sudden spike in the use of ROVs in the year 2000, which followed by downturn the year after that. This is alsi the case for submersibles in 2005 and 2006. Could there be a trend here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we can see that uses of trawls are actually quite steady here. It seems there are times when certain corals are just to deep for ROVs or submersible to reach.\n",

    "Third, I'm suprised that AUVs are rarely used. It sort of make sense since over 80% of the ocean are unmapped. Maybe this is one of the engineering challenges that needs to be further explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, looks like towed cameras have only recently used after 2010. But we also have a spike here on 2014, where it is much more preferable to used towed cameras instead of ROVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow that was really interesting. We ended up with more questions than answers, but we got what we need. Looks like we will need to support ROVs, submersibles, towed cameras, and some trawls. I think I'm going to include AUVs here because I think there are potential for them to be developed. Maybe as we gain more scientists and engineers in our research resort, we can find a way to make AUVs more mainstream. If we have autonomous vehicles on land and air, why not in the ocean too right?\n",

For the equipments, we want to support four types: ROVs, submersibles, towed cameras, trawls, and AUVs. Finally for our partners, we wanto invite the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, and the Southwest Fisheries Science Center."
