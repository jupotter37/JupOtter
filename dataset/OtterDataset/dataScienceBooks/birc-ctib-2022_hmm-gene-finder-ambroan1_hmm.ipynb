    "# A hidden Markov model gene-finder\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise below, you will implement and experiment with an example of how to apply a HMM for identifying coding regions(genes) in genetic material. We consider only procaryotes, which have a particular simple gene format. A gene is a sequence of triplets, codons, that encode proteins. We saw this in the first project. Now, we assume that we have a genomic sequence, and our goal is to recognise which part of the genome encodes genes, and which do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genes can be found on both strands of a genome, so as we scan along the genome sequence, we might encounter them in the direction we are scanning, or we might encounter them in the reverse order, seeing them backwards, so to speak. In either case, we recon that gene coding sequences likely have a different nucleotide composition, and we will exploit this in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build a hidden Markov model, where the hidden states are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-coding: we are not in a coding sequence\n",
    "- Coding: We are inside a gene that is coded in the direction we are reading\n",
    "- Reverse coding: We are inside a gene that is encoded on the other strand than then one we are scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two different models. A 3-state HMM that encodes only the three states we just listed, and a 7-state HMM that adds a little more structure. It models that genes come as codons, so when we are inside a gene, we should always a number of nucleotides divisible by three, and if the nucleotide composition is different for different codon positions, it can model that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can draw the two models like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gene-finder models](figures/gene-finder-models.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both have coding states (C), non-coding states (N), and reverse-coding states (R), but the second has three of each of C and R. The numbers in square brackets in the states are just that, numbers. Specifically numbers from zero up to the number of states minus one. Representing states like that is convinient if we are to use states to index into vectors and matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another purpose to this project, beyond learning how to implement and apply hidden Markov models. We will do the project in a so-called [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter is one of many ways of combining documentation and code, a technique known as literate programming although it is rarely used in programming but quite frequently in data science. The text you are reading now is, in fact, written in a Jupyter Notebook that contains both the project description and the template code you need to get started. The file is named `hmm.ipynb`, and you should edit that file to fill out the missing details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** DO NOT EDIT `README.md`. When you commit to GitHub, `README.md` will be overwritten by a file extracted from `hmm.ipynb`. The only file you should edit in this project is `hmm.ipynb` (or any additional files you create for testing the code you write in `hmm.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can edit Jupyter Notebooks in several different ways. If you follow the link above to [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) you can get a browser interface. If you are using VSCode as your editor, you can install an extension and edit Jupyter files natively. (That is what I am doing). Your first exercise is to figure out how to edit `hmm.ipynb`. When you have managed that, proceed to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you commit the notebook to GitHub it is evaluated from scratch, and the result becomes the new README.md. If you are evaluating cells out of order, your state might be different from one where you evaluate the notebook from the beginning, so be careful to check that the clean evaluation is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we have two bacterial genomes that someone has painstakingly annotated with genes (and I have then fracked up the good work to make the data look the way our models assume it will rather than the mess that God created).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two genomes, found in `data/genome1.fa` and `data/genome2.fa`, are stored in [FASTA files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format), and I have provided a function you can used to load them.

    "\n",
    "HMMs are used for more than making predictions about (or *decoding*) hidden states--I myself used a decade on just estimating parameters, but the situtation was slightly more complicated than the one in the previous section--it is a common usage. Given a hidden Markov model with estimated parameters, can we extract a likely sequence of hidden states from the observed states?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, can we use an HMM to make a function `decode(x, theta) -> z` that gives us the hidden sequence when all we have is the observed sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might then ask where we get `theta` from, if we don't have `z`. After all, we needed `z` above to estimate the parameters. Well, sometimes we have `z` for *some* data. We might have `z` for the first genome but we want to predict the hidden states from the second genome. In other cases, we don't have any hidden sequences at all, and then we need other methods for estimating `theta`. Such methods exist, but they are beyond this class. If you want to learn about it, then maybe it is a good topic for a PIB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, in this section we will use the Viterbi algorithm to implement this `decode(x, theta)` function.\n",
    "\n",

    "You have already seen the Viterbi algorithm at the lecture. It is a dynamic programming algorithm with the base case\n",
    "\n",
    "`V[i,0] = pi[i] * E[i,x[0]]`\n",

    "\n",
    "Our first task is to compute this table.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our current knowledge of floating point numbers, we should easily recognise that computing `V` will give is very small numbers--we are multiplying increasingly small floats--so it won't work for long sequences. The solution we used before was to move to log-space, and for the Viterbi algorithm that will work as well. Generally, you can move products to log-space by changing multiplication to addition, but you cannot move a sum to log-space. Here, we have products, which is then fine, and we have a `max`. Can we move `max` to log-space? We can if what we really care about is which index has the maximum value, rather than the actual value itself. Since log is a monotone function, `argmax f(i) = argmax log(f(i))`, so we are fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate the recursion above into one that works in log-space. The parameters `(pi,T,E)` also have to move to log-space, but you saw code earlier for doing that.\n",

It might even be impossible (have probability zero) to go from state `s` to state `t` at all; it just happens that there is a likely path that ends in `s` at position `i` and *another* likely path that ends in state `t` at position `i+1`.\n",
