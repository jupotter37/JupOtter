    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publicly available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\\\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performance would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\\\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\\\$50,000 and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\\\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\\\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classification), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "**Please note** that the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, machine learning models differ in popularity among practitioners in the field. KDNuggets, a specialized website holds a yearly survey where they ask for the algorithms used in real-world applications [(KDNuggets)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/top-data-science-machine-learning-methods-2018-2019.html) In the most recent survey in 2018/2019, ca. 65\\% of the 833 participants self-identified their affiliation as industry or self-employed. The top 3 methods were regression, decision tree/rules and clustering; ensemble methods/random forests were also pretty high-ranking. Therefore, I've chosen logistic regression, decision trees and ensemble methods as ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the dependent variable \"income\" in the data set is pretty skewed; the two classes are unbalanced, which poses a problem for all supervised learning models offered here. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression:\n",
    "* Real-world application in the industry:\n",
    " * \"Logistic regression is used in various fields, including machine learning, most medical fields, and social sciences. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd et al. using logistic regression. [...] Logistic regression may be used to predict the risk of developing a given disease (e.g. diabetes; coronary heart disease), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.). Another example might be to predict whether an Indian voter will vote BJP or Trinamool Congress or Left Front or Congress, based on age, income, sex, race, state of residence, votes in previous elections, etc. The technique can also be used in engineering, especially for predicting the probability of failure of a given process, system or product. It is also used in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's propensity to purchase a product or halt a subscription, etc. In economics it can be used to predict the likelihood of a person's choosing to be in the labor force, and a business application would be to predict the likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage.\" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)\n",
    "\n",
    " * An especially relevant example of a logistic regression use case is the prediction of clicks on Facebook ads [SemanticScholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Practical-Lessons-from-Predicting-Clicks-on-Ads-at-He-Pan/daf9ed5dc6c6bad5367d7fd8561527da30e9b8dd). Ad click rates are important for pricing the ads, and Facebook uses such an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strengths of the model; conditions for good performance:\n",
    " * logistic regression can handle classification tasks as the dependent variable can be binary (or even multi-class) and categorical, which is well-suited for our use-case (i.e. deciding whether the donor makes more or less than \\$50000).\n",
    " * the independent variables can be categorial or continuous.\n",
    " * log-linear models offer a well-defined goodness-of-fit (pseudo-R²) evaluation metric and a statistical test of the significance of individual coefficients, so it is easy to assess the appropriateness of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weaknesses of the model; conditions for poor performance\n",
    " * A linear model does not take into account interactions among the independent variables and cannot deal with multi-collinearity. [Backhaus](http://www.multivariate.de/logistische-regression.html)\n",
    " * It is sensitive to outliers, so we have to do an exploratory data analysis first to identify those outliers.\n",
    " * It requires normalization.\n",
    " * It requires regularization when large number of independent variables are available.\n",
    " * It exhibits high bias and a low probability of overfitting (which can be a weakness or a strength, depending on the complexity of the use-case)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    " * We can follow the [Scikit-learn algorithm cheat sheet](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/) to identify good candidates for the problem. We are trying to predict multi-class categorial variables, we have labeled data, so we definitely need a classification algorithm.\n",
    " * Logistic regression is flexible enough to handle the different data types in our data set, so we can use all variables.\n",
    " * We have >600K samples, so this linear algorithm is well suited.\n",
    " * As we don't have many independent variables, regularization is not an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "* Real-world application in the industry: Decision Tree learning is widely used for all kinds of supervised learning tasks. [Decision Tree Applications for Data Modelling (Artificial Intelligence)](http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/) lists some examples\n",
    " * Customer Relationship Management: the identification of power shoppers. \n",
    " * Fraudulent Financial Statement Detection: the detection of tax evasion\n",
    " * Engineering: the identification of drivers of energy consumption in households\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strengths of the model; conditions for good performance [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/tree.html) \n",
    " * Decision trees can directly deal with variables of different scales (categorical, ordinal, interval)\n",
    " * It is a very intuitive algorithm that produces an easily visualizable tree structure or business rules. The output of the model is explainable.\n",
    " * fast prediction.\n",
    " * Non-statistical approach that makes no assumptions of the training data or prediction residuals; e.g., no distributional, independence, or constant variance assumptions\n",
    " * Requires little data preparation, e.g. no normalization of independent variables and no dummy variables for encoding categorial variables required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weaknesses of the model; conditions for poor performance (mainly taken from [Machine learning in science and industry](https://www.slideshare.net/arogozhnikov/machine-learning-in-science-and-industry-day-2) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/tree.html))\n",
    " * Decision tree learning requires extensive tuning as it introduces a number of hyperparameters.\n",
    " * It is prone to overfitting\n",
    " * Decision tree learning uses greedy optimization, and as such will only deliver a heuristic solution, but probably not the optimal decision tree. Building the optimal decision tree is an NP-complete problem and thus not feasible for large data sets.\n",
    " * Decision trees suffer from data-induced instability, i.e. little variation in training data produce different classification rules. This is especially annoying when retraining a previously trained model with fresh data.\n",
    " * Determining feature importances is not really well-defined.\n",
    " * Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data\n",
    " * Decision trees are suitable for classification tasks like this one.\n",
    " * Decision Trees are flexible enough to handle the different data types in our data set, so we can use all variables.\n",
    " * We need to take care of balancing the data set when using decision trees.\n",
    " * As decision trees are fast, they should work well with our 600K records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble Methods (Boosting)\n",
    "Boosting as an ensemble method work by collecting simple models (weak learners), that are combined to give a prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-world application in the industry:\n",
    " * Optical Character Recognition [Freund and Schapire](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yfreund/papers/IntroToBoosting.pdf)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Strengths of the model; conditions for good performance: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost)\n",
    " * The AdaBoost training process selects only those features known to improve the predictive power of the model, reducing dimensionality and potentially improving execution time as irrelevant features need not be computed.\n",
    " * It is an incremental learner, and thus overfitting can be controlled by the number of weak learners. \n",
    " * Boosting can be applied to any classification algorithm, so it is very flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weaknesses of the model; conditions for poor performance:[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost)\n",
    " * It possibly has a large number of hyperparameters for the base estimators.\n",
    " * AdaBoost is sensitive to noisy data and outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    " * Boosting is suitable for binary classification tasks like this one, if we choose the right base classificator.\n",
    " * Weak learners can be efficiently trained even on larger datasets like ours. AdaBoost is computationally simple.\n",
    " * If we use Decision Tree classifiers as the weak learner, we can process all types of independent variables.\n",

For AdaBoost, we see the desired behaviour in a learning curve: the larger the training set size, the more the training error increases and the testing error decreases. For the  100% training data situation, the testing error and the training error are pretty close, i.e. the F-scores are pretty close (0.712 / 0.725). We don't see the same situation for the DecisionTreeClassifier - the learning curves don't converge, the tree seems to have too high of a variance, thus overfitting. The LogisticRegression classifier also shows error convergence, but it does not score as high as AdaBoost.\n"

    "We start out with a data set, that is split into a training and a test set. The AdaBoost model is trained as follows:\n",
    "\"The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights $w_1, w_2, ..., w_N$ to each of the training samples. Initially, those weights are all set to $w_i = \\frac{1}{N}$, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence\" [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost) In the end, we have a sequence of weak learners, and each outputs a prediction for the input data. Each weak learned is now judged on how accurate it works. As an example, if it always gives correct predictions, this weak learner t receives a strong positive weight $\\alpha_t$. A trained AdaBoost model consist of the sequence of weak learners and the weights $\\alpha_{1...n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model has been successfully trained and tested, it can be deployed into production. There, we would expect a new data record with the same structure are the training data. This new data record is then fed into the trained model to make a prediction. Each weak learner receives the input record, makes its prediction and then an overall score is calculated based on the weighted sum of the predictions of the weak learners. Then a sign function is applied to the score and if it is greater than 0 then the positive class is predicted otherwise the negative class [Schapire](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/talks/nips-tutorial.pdf)\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "I am very surprised by the extracted feature importance; those map only partially to the 5 features that I had in mind. I had \"age\" at the second place which is correct, and I guessed \"education\" to be on place 5 which is at least partially correct, as \"education-num\" is on the 5th place in the visualization. So I suppose, my reasons for the importance of age and education are at least partially confirmed by the chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I was totally off regarding \"occupation\", \"sex\" and \"race\". I obviously underestimated the effect of capital gains, i.e. income generated by capital investments. \"capital-loss\" points in the same direction. You could venture a guess that really rich people derive their income not only from a highly-paid job, but from their successful financial investments (maybe available to them by inherited wealth). This assumption is supported by the fact that \"hours-per-week\" is a less important predictor than the capital-related one. It also makes a lot of sense that \"hours-per-week\" is a predictor of high income, as salaried employees are  supposed to work longer the more they earn.\n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

I would have to analyze the financial and reputation effect of the increased error rate on the amount of donations and on other business metrics (i.e. donor retention). Hardware is cheap and gridsearching AdaBoost is easily parallelizable, so I think I could come up with a business case to keep all features and buy some cheap compute power instead. Also, I don't see any real-time requirement in this use case; socio-economic factors in the census data do not change very rapidly.\n",
