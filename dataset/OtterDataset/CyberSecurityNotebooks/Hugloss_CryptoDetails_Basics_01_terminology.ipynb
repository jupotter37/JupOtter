    "# Cryptography\n",
    "Cryptography is a technique used to secure the communication between two parties from a third. The term cryptography is derived from two ancient greek terms, “kryptos” which means “hidden” and “graphein” which means “to write”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cryptography Key Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secret\n",
    "The data which we are trying to protect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key\n",
    "A piece of data used for encrypting and decrypting the secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function\n",
    "The process or function used to encrypt the secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cipher\n",
    "The encrypted secret data, the digital secret, the output of the mathematical function or a cryptographic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "This is the process from plain text (ordinary text) to cipher text (random sequence of bits).\n",
    "Decryption\n",
    "Encryption is the reverse process of converting ciphertext into plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Key Cryptography\n",
    "This encryption method uses a pair of keys: an encryption key, and a decryption key, named public key and private key, respectively. The key pair generated by this algorithm consists of a private key and a unique public key that is generated using the same algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n",
    "A new approach to protecting digital secrets that prove knowledge of a secret without revealing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash Functions\n",
    "This type of encryption doesn’t make use of keys. It uses a cipher to generate a hash value of a fixed length. The function converts plain text (no matter the size) into a hash of fixed size. It is nearly impossible for the contents of plain text to be recovered from the cipher text. Think of it like trying to recreate a human from a fingerprint, a fingerprint uniquely represents a human no matter the size of the human and you can’t reverse engineer a fingerprint to recreate the human.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merkle Trees\n",
    "A data storage technique that compresses or packs data for storing blockchains with a tamper-free component built in. Merkle trees are built upon hashing principles in that each hash becomes a part of the next hash to build a tamper resistant data storage model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Key Cryptography\n",
    "Public key cryptography uses a pair of a public key and a private key to perform different tasks. Public keys are widely distributed, while private keys are kept secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a person's public key, it is possible to encrypt a message so that only the person with the private key can decrypt and read it. Using a private key, a digital signature can be created so that anyone with the corresponding public key can verify that the message was created by the owner of the private key and was not modified since.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs authenticate parties without the need to widely transmit private information online. A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method that allows a party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions can take anything as input and create an output with a fixed size. This makes it possible to condense anything into a piece of data of a fixed size and is how messages are condensed for digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s easy to calculate a hash, but hard to determine a hash input from the output. The best option is to keep trying inputs until one produces the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs that differ by a single bit produce hashes that differ by half of their bits on average. This prevents someone from finding a desired hash input using a “hill climbing”.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is infeasible to find two inputs that produce the same output when hashed. Since a hash can take any input and produce a fixed output, it makes sense that multiple different inputs will create the same output. A good hash function will make it so that you have to try a large number of inputs before finding two that produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Merkle Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A special type of data storage structure based on hash functions is called a Merkle tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is structured as a binary tree; the leaves contain the values to be stored and each internal node is the hash of its two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides efficient lookups and protection against forgery since verifying a transaction is included in the tree. Can be accomplished by sending only the transaction, the hash contained in each node between the transaction leaf node and the root, and the hash values used to create each hash sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking up a transaction in a Merkle tree with three levels includes sending two transactions (the desired one and the other child of its parent) and three hashes (the transaction’s parent, the root, and the root’s other child).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethereum vs. Hyperledger Fabric\n",
    "The use of public keys for identity management is a logical choice since knowledge of a public key is necessary for verification of digital signatures. Both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric use digital signatures on transactions and blocks to verify the identity of the creator and that the signed data has not been modified since signing. Public key cryptography is used in the blockchain as a method for managing users’ identities without revealing real world identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ethereum, users are identified by an address that is directly related to the user's public key. This provides identity verification while preserving anonymity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hyperledger Fabric, users are identified via X.509 certificates. These certificates provide several pieces of information about the user, but one of these is also the user's public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions are at the core of all blockchain technology. One of the primary uses for hash functions is chaining blocks together. In both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, blocks include the hash of the previous block to tie the blockchain into a cohesive whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs are to increase the privacy of users. Currently, Ethereum is working on a layer 2 solution, where a second layer blockchain would store large amounts of data and only prove the batch of information is valid to layer 1 (mainnet). Hyperledger Fabric has a pluggable cryptographic library that supports ZKP techniques for enhanced privacy measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merkle trees are a data structure that allows authenticated storage with efficient data retrieval. Both Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric are smart contract platforms that use a particular type of Merkle tree called the Patricia tree to store the current state of their virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Cyber Security vs Blockchain Cyber Security\n",
    "One of the primary differences between cybersecurity in a traditional computing environment and on the blockchain is the environment itself and what it is and isn't designed to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Cyber Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional computing environment is a company network fully or, at least mostly, under the control of the company's computer security staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many organizations are making the shift to cloud-based environments, they still have a high degree of control over the security and configuration of their rented systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional networks are highly centralized, and the focus of cybersecurity on these systems is primarily perimeter-focused. All systems and authorized users on the network are trusted or semi-trusted, so the focus is on preventing attackers from entering from outside the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blockchain Cyber Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Blockchains are designed to be decentralized, distributed systems running on untrusted hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "While security in traditional environments is designed to provide security by putting all data in one place and building walls around it, security in blockchain is based on ensuring that data is protected from modification by copying data to as many locations as possible to make modification of all copies infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional infrastructure focuses on confidentiality and integrity, while blockchain is designed to provide integrity and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different Types of Blockchains\n",
    "A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "A private blockchain network requires an invitation, and must be validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules. Private blockchains are usually set up as permissioned networks, placing restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network, and only in certain transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we try to understand the main difference between a public and private blockchain, it is important to understand the terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public Blockchains\n",
    "A public blockchain is open to anyone to join. Public blockchains are decentralized where no one has control over the network. These immutable and censorship resistant networks are ideal for participants who don't trust each other, but still interact in a network and take part in consensus. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of public, permissionless blockchains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permissionless Blockchains\n",
    "Public blockchains are permissionless. Anyone effectively can join the blockchain network. No one is prohibited from joining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Private Blockchains\n",
    "Private blockchains define a user's rights on the network prior to admittance. Restrictions are placed on activities such as who can write to the ledger and what transaction they can participate in. Hyperledger and Corda blockchains are examples of private permissioned blockchains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Permissioned Blockchains\n",
    "In a permissioned blockchain, participation is permissioned by an organization or a consortium of organizations. This empowered entity defines who can participate in certain transactions and consensus on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public Blockchain Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ledger is distributed\n",
    "The database is not centralized like in a client-server approach, and all nodes in the blockchain participate in the transaction validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutable\n",
    "When something is written to the blockchain, it cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open Consensus Model\n",
    "No restriction placed on who can operate a node in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open read and write\n",
    "Anyone can participate by submitting transactions to the blockchain, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin; transactions can be viewed on the blockchain explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low barrier to entry\n",
    "Transactions on a public network can be accomplished with an Internet connection and a cell phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secure due to mining (51% rule)\n",
    "With Bitcoin, obtaining a majority of network power could potentially enable massive double spending, and the ability to prevent transaction confirmations, among other potentially nefarious acts. This has never been accomplished as the computing power needed to stage such an attack would be too costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private Blockchain Benefits\n",
    "### Ledger is distributed/immutable\n",
    "The database is not centralized like in a client-server approach, and all nodes in the blockchain participate in the transaction validation. When something is written to the blockchain, it cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compliance support\n",
    "As an enterprise, you likely would have compliance requirements to adhere to, and having control of your infrastructure would enable this requirement more seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faster transactions\n",
    "When you distribute the nodes locally, but also have much less nodes to participate in the ledger, the performance is faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consensus more efficient/more options\n",
    "More options for consensus models. Enterprise or private blockchains have less nodes and usually have a different consensus algorithm, such as BFT vs. POW, which we will discuss in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better scalability\n",
    "Being able to add nodes and services on demand can provide a great advantage to the enterprise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enterprise permissioned\n",
    "The enterprise controls the resources and access to the blockchain, hence private and/or permissioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Blockchain Anonymity Techniques\n",
    "The following are only some of the mechanisms developed and implemented in various blockchains:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-knowledge proofs\n",
    "Zero-knowledge proofs use cryptographic algorithms to allow a user to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret. A prover proves knowledge of a secret without revealing it. New technology referred to as SNARK (Succinct Non-interactive - ARgument of Knowledge) are fine tuning privacy issues on blockchains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stealth addresses\n",
    "Stealth addresses involve using one-time addresses to perform transactions on a blockchain. A stealth address is just a one-time address that makes it impossible to link a transaction to a known account. This prevents the data mining attacks on privacy that we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ring signatures\n",
    "We mentioned previously that transactions are digitally signed. With ring signatures, all that can be determined from a transaction is that a member of a group signed it, but not the particular member.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CoinJoin\n",
    "The ability to see who is performing transactions with whom is dangerous to user privacy and anonymity. Protocols like CoinJoin mix several transactions together so that it is difficult to pair senders with recipients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidential transactions\n",
    "Confidential transactions take advantage of homomorphic encryption, which makes it possible to perform mathematical operations on encrypted data. This means that the data contained in a transaction can be hidden from the public, while still allowing the network to verify that the transaction is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Establishing Trust in Blockchains\n",
    "The users base this trust on the fact that:\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has not been tampered with.\n",
    "The blockchain is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)\n",
    "\"Web 1.0 used centralized identity; Web 2.0 graduated to federated identity; now Web 3.0 is using decentralized digital identity, a model known as \"self-sovereign identity\" or \"SSI\" because now individuals control their own portable digital identity credentials in their own digital wallets—just like we prove our identity with physical credentials from our physical wallets every day. The digital signatures on these credentials use blockchain technology for decentralized public key management. Finally we can have a trust layer for the Internet that doesn't require everyone to rely on centralized authorities\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "### Self-sovereign identity (SSI)\n",
    "SSI is relatively new, having only emerged onto the Internet stage in 2016. At one level, SSI is a set of principles about how identity and personal data control should work across digital networks. At another level, SSI is a set of technologies which build upon core concepts in identity management, distributed computing, blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifiable credentials\n",
    "The essence of decentralized identity is transitioning physical identity credentials (birth certificate, driver licenses, passports, college degrees, medical records, etc.) to a digital twin that the individual can possess in a digital wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verifier\n",
    "A verifier is the person, organization or computer program granting verification of an assertion. They request proof that a claim or statement about a credential is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issuers\n",
    "Issuers are the source of credentials—every credential has an issuer. Most issuers are organizations such as government agencies (passports), financial institutions (credit cards), universities (degrees), corporations (employment credentials), NGOs (membership cards), or churches (awards).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Holders/Provers\n",
    "Providers request verifiable credentials from issuers, hold them in the holder’s digital wallet (below), and present proofs of claims from one or more credentials when requested by verifiers (and approved by the holder). Although we most commonly think of individuals as holders/provers, holders/provers can also be organizations using enterprise wallets, or things in the sense of the Internet of Things (IoT). The trust triangle represents the Trust over IP version of how the new relationship will operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decentralized identifiers\n",
    "According to the WC3, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, decentralized digital identity credentials. These new identifiers are designed to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority. WC3 is working on ways to standardize the format for DIDs."
