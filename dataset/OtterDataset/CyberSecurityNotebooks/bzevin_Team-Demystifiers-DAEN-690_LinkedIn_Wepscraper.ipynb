      "   I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Science and Technology at George Mason University and a member of the Center for Secure Information Systems.  I am instructor of AIT courses \"Cyber Security Fundamentals\", \"Applied Machine Learning\" and \"Applied Biometric Technologies\". From February 2015 to July 2017 I was an Adjunct Professor and a Post-doctoral Researcher in Pattern Recognition and Biometrics at the University of North Carolina Charlotte UNC-C, Department of Computer Science, member of the Video and Image Analysis lab (VIAlab) at UNC-C.From February 2011 to January 2015 I was a post-doctoral Associate Researcher at Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University and at the Center for Identification Technology (CiTeR-NSF). From February 2011 to December 2012 I was a member of the i-probe lab supervised by Dr. Arun Ross. I received a five-year degree (Bachelor and M.Sc.) in computer engineering, in March 2006, and a PhD in Computer and Automation Engineering, in December 2010, both at the University of Naples Federico II (Italy) supervised by Prof. Carlo Sansone. My research involves fingerprint liveness detection, multi-biometrics, age / gender estimation from fingerprints, interoperability enhancement between fingerprint sensors, adaptive signal processing strategies for enhancing DNA profiles from degraded DNA samples and fingerprint de-identification for privacy enhancement.

      "   I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA, USA.  My research leverages microscale transport phenomena to enable new solutions to fundamental problems including clean energy generation and storage, water desalination and remediation, and targeted drug delivery.  One major research focus is the capabilities and applications of active colloids, which are micrometer-size particles (50 times smaller than the width of a human hair) that can propel themselves through liquids, like tiny submarines.  These particles show promise for microscale manufacturing, oil/water separation, and even cancer treatment.Outside of research, I have conducted outreach activities in Washington, D.C., local science museums, and lectured at both general and technical levels in the United States and internationally.When I'm not in the office or the lab, you can find me playing jazz on my upright bass, competing in a triathlon, or hiking in Shenandoah National Park.I am an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA, USA.
