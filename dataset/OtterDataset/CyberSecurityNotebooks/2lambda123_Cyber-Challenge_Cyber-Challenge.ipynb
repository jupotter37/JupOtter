    "\n",
    "Especially in today's world, cyber security is crucial to ensuring the protection of computer systems and the information contained within them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many aspects to cyber security, one way to protect information is by the use of <b>cryptography</b>, which is the encrypting and decrypting of messages. Cryptography can be utilized for confidentiality,  authentification, security and many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <i><u>KEY</u></i> terms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main terms to note when talking about cryptography: <b>Plain Text, Cipher Text, and Key. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In order to <u>encrypt</u> a message, you use a <b>Key</b> to transform the <b>Plain Text</b> into <b>Cipher Text</b>. \n",
    "+ To <u>decrypt</u> the message, the <b>Key</b> will then be used to transform the <b>Cipher Text</b> back into <b>Plain Text</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### History & Classical Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "The earliest known use of encryption methods were circa 1900 BCE with the use of hieroglyphs. In third century BCE, the Greeks and Spartans used a cryptographic device to send and receive secret messages called a Scytale, which used a cylindrical device and leather to wrap and \"jumble\" plain text into cipher text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auguste Kerckhoffs was a Dutch cryptographer in the 19th century who stated 6 design principles for ciphers:\n",
    "+ Must be indecipherable\n",
    "+ Should not require secrecy; a.k.a not a problem when in enemy hands\n",
    "+ Easily communicable and easy to remember the key without notes\n",
    "+ Applicable to telegraphs (could say computers in today's world)\n",
    "+ Portable and not require several persons\n",
    "+ Easy to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Within classic cryptography, there are various kinds of ciphers including <b>substitution ciphers</b>, where text is <i>interchanged</i> with other text, and <b>transposition ciphers</b>, where the text is <i>rearranged</i> into a different order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher is a simple example of a substitution cipher. Named after Julius Caesar, this particular cipher is used to encrypt  messages by replacing letters with another letter that is a particular distance away from the original character in the alphabet. For instance, Caesar used a shift of 3, which means, the letter A would be replaced with the letter D, the letter B would be replaced by E, and so on. Check out his mapping below:\n",

    "#### What is Base64?\n",
    "Base64 allows binary data to be represented in a way that looks and acts as plain text for email transmission over the Internet. It facilitates reliablility of data to be stored in databases, sent in emails, or used in text-based format such as XML. Base64 is basically used for representing data in an ASCII string format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does Base64 work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Base64 encoding is executed as follows:\n",
    " 1. The text to be encoded is converted into its respective decimal values, that is, into their ASCII equivalent. \n",
    " 2. The decimal values are converted into their binary equivalents.\n",
    " 3. All the binary equivalents are concatenated, obtaining a large set of binary numbers.\n",
    " 4. The large set of binary numbers is divided into equal sections, with each section containing only 6 bits.\n",
    " 5. The equal sets of 6 bits are converted into their decimal equivalents.\n",
    " 6. The decimal equivalents are converted into their Base64 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Base64 decoding is executed as follows:\n",
    " 1. Each character in the string is changed to its Base64 decimal value.\n",
    " 2. The decimal values are converted into their binary equivalents.\n",
    " 3. The first two bits of the binary numbers are truncated from each of the binary numbers obtained, and the sets of 6 bits are combined, forming one large string of binary digits\n",
    " 4. The large string of binary digits is split into groups of 8 bits.\n",
    " 5. The 8-bit binary numbers are converted into their decimal equivalents.\n",
    " 6. The decimal values obtained are converted into their ASCII equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hexa-what?\n",
    "You may have heard the term <i>hexadecimal</i> before, but what does it mean? Hexadecimal refers to the base-16 number system and is commonly used in the transmission of data for its readability as opposed to the lengthy binary formats such as base-2. You might be familiar with hexadecimal color representations:\n",

    "#### How are we going to implement this? Easy, with Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "For our benefit, python already includes a library, <i>base64</i> that contains all of the code we need to encode or decode using base64 and <i>binascii</i> that will help us \"hexlify\". Let's try some examples. Run the cell below to encode to base64."
