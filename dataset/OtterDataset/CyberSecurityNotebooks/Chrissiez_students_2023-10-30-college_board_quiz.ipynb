    "\n",
    "## 24. Compression By Replacing TH and IS with characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte pair encoding is a data encoding technique. The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters that appear in the string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a corresponding character that does not appear in the string. The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the \"THIS_IS_THE_BEST_WISH\" can be encoded as \"%#_#_%E_BEST_W#H\" by replacing all instances of \"TH\" with \"%\" and replacing all instances of\"IS\" with \"#\".\n",

    "C. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because an encoded string can be restored to its original version.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Byte pair encoding is an example of a lossless transformation because it can be used to transmit messages securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correct Answer: C\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is lossless because an encoded string can be restored to its original version\n",
    "\n",
    "My Answer: B\n",
