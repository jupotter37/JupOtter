    "\n",
    "- From Mathematics we know that functions perform some operation and return one value.\n",
    "    - This value may consist of sub-values, dimensions, etc. For example there may many functions of the form,<br><br>\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "F:\\mathbb{R^n}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R^m}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    - The _range_ of the function may be multi-dimensional/composite, but a function maps to _exactly one_ element for any given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python functions \"encapsulate\" the performance of some particular operation, so it can be used by others (for example, the sqrt() function).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why use functions?\n",
    "    - Support divide-and-conquer strategy for complex functions.\n",
    "    - Decomposition strategy for solving complex problems with many simpler, reusable functions and algorithms.\n",
    "    - Abstraction of an operation. Hides complexity from caller.\n",
    "    - Reuse. Once written, use again.\n",
    "    - Sharing. If tested, others can use.\n",
    "    - Security. Well tested, then secure for reuse.\n",
    "    - Simplify code. More readable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Comments on initial reviews of HW2\n",
    "    - I defined HW2 as a set of tasks. Many of the tasks map to one or more general purpose, reusable functions.\n",
    "    - Some/many of you implemented your solution as one relatively large, monolithic sequence of statements. Others implemented functions that perform multiple, independent tasks.\n",
    "    - We will not take off points in HW2. The solution we publish will demonstrate use of functions and decomposition. I have gone over the concept in class.\n",
    "    - HW3 will require better design with reusable functions and decomposition.\n",
    "    - Some terms:\n",
    "        - A [_divide and conquer algorithm_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm) works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.\n",
    "        - [_Decomposition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)) in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand, program, and maintain.\n",
    "        - In software engineering, a [_monolithic application_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) describes a software application which is designed without modularity. Modularity is desirable, in general, as it supports reuse of parts of the application logic and also facilitates maintenance by allowing repair or replacement of parts of the application without requiring wholesale replacement.\n",
    "    - E1006 is about __computing,__ not just Python programming.\n",
    "        - The course is a requirement $\\Rightarrow$ some students know Python and programming and are \"phoning it in.\" \n",
    "        - Many students in my advanced classes write some of the crappiest code I have ever seen.\n",
    "        - Some students that can program python skip lectures because they have programmed in Python. This course is about computing and introduction of software engineering.\n",
    "        - This is important. Interviewers and internships take software engineering seriously.\n",
    "        - Poor software engineering and design may negatively affect exam scores.\n",
