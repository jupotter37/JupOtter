    "# RAG Evaluation Test Set Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) framework to generate a **test set** that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline. We then use the Python [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) library to run some requests through this pipeline and we evaluate the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- You will need an OpenAI access key, which requires a paid account you can sign up for at https://platform.openai.com/signup.\n",
    "- After obtaining this key, store it in plain text in your home in directory in the `~/.openai.key` file.\n",
    "- (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."

      "Answer: The mission of the Vector Institute is to develop programming for Black and Indigenous students, postdoctoral fellows, and recent graduates to build research opportunities and expand career pathways in AI for historically underrepresented groups. This mission is aimed at fostering diversity and inclusion in the field of AI. Additionally, the institute provides infrastructure and software engineering expertise to support world-leading research, enabling researchers to push the frontiers of AI innovation. Vector also actively contributes expertise and insights on policy issues related to AI adoption to support the best interests of Ontarians and Canadians. Through initiatives like the Smart Health Initiative, Vector is demonstrating the power of machine learning in improving the quality and efficiency of health services. Additionally, Vector is equipping AI professionals to work safely with sensitive data, further advancing AI-based innovation and deep learning and machine learning practices.\n",
