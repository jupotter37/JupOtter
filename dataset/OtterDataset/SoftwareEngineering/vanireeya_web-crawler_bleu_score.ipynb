            "======= actual_answer   === conventionally , computer engineering focuses on the combination of hardware and systems software (embedded systems , mobile devices) , computer science focuses on programming and theory (formal languages , programming paradigms , etc .) , and software engineering focuses on programming and methodology (analysis , design , testing , maintenance , cost estimation , project management , etc .) . all three programs overlap . for example , all three programs cover programming , methodology , hardware , and systems software , but in different amounts .\n",
