      "EDIT: Clarity There are regulations around FB, as well as civil remedies for violations of their terms, privacy policy, etc. They lay out how they will treat users and are beholden to follow it, lest face civil (and possibly criminal) penalties. As a user, you decide whether those terms are sufficient. If the people with whom you communicate can't be convinced to communicate with you otherwise, then why would you have a right to demand that FB accomodate your preferences? That's a sincere question. And, honestly, we have more choices than ever to communicate with people. Personally, I refuse to upload my life to FB for their monetization. But, much as I dislike some of FB's practices (and its fundamental revenue model), I don't see why people believe they should be able to dictate nuances of their various policies as if Facebook owes them the right to use their service on their terms. If people think that that what FB offers is worth the price, then they are getting exactly what they paid for. If they don't think it's worth it, then they should simply move on. \n",

      "Once you take money from investors, you have both a legal and a moral responsibility to them. It's important to remember that selling equity is really selling something, just like selling a product. You can't sell something, take somebody's money, and then just not deliver. What you are selling to investors, generally, is return on investment. The real problem comes in because founders and VCs have different understandings of \"grow fast\". There will come choices that have different levels of risk. VCs always want you to take the high-risk, high-reward path, because they have a portfolio company and are looking for the few really big winners. You, on the other hand, are trying to build something (team, community, product, etc), and so you will favor slower but safer growth. I guess in theory you could sell VCs on a high-growth approach and then turn around and say, \"Ha ha, fuck you, we're going to keep your money and try to grow modestly.\" But a) VCs are way better at their game than you are, so they're hard to fool, and b) then you're an asshole, which is bad on its own and also has consequences for future relationships (and future funding). Plus, if you're in a VC-fundable space, you'll probably have competitors who are also taking money, and they'll be able to outspend you on future rounds. \n",

      "This has been discussed ad nauseum by insiders to the industry for close to 10 years now. Nobody has yet pulled it all together, not for lack of trying, but because of the one major roadblock that you mentioned -- actually going to look at homes. Everything else can be put online, and most of it already is online in one form another, just not always through a single vendor. I know I'm simply expanding on what you already said, but ... one way or another, you have to go look at a house that you intend to buy. And you don't want the seller there. So you need someone who is trusted by the seller to let you in. If you can put together a service whereby someone other than real estate agents can do that task, then maybe you could gain traction on everything else. But I have not talked to anybody who is interested in the work of automating everything else until the problem of physical access to homes is solved, because there isn't money in paperwork. The money in real estate comes from two sources - commissions and mortgages. And most marketing plans depend on reducing commissions, not just redirecting them to a new recipient. So it makes much more business sense to ignore the paperwork that agents normally do, and focus on the mortgage process than the inspection, title, closing process. After all, that paperwork isn't a pain point for buyers or sellers - they don't do it anyway. The agents do. So the attitude becomes one of, \"Who cares if an online service automates the paperwork, when you still needed that agent to open the door? Let the agent go do the paperwork, and at least do some work to earn their stupid commission.\" \n",

      "On the other hand you are just as likely to get a loan you otherwise wouldn't have because you haven't been seen with questionable folks. In any case that kind of policy is already illegal. And it's not even technically feasible at the moment. Even if it was, it's very unlikely there is a strong correlation between being seen with some random person in a photo, and your likelihood of paying a loan. There is plenty of questionable shit happening right now in the NSA and stuff. I don't see why we need to resort to fearmongering about absurd hypotheticals. \n",

      "I mostly agree with you. The web itself is wholly incorrectly designed, or should I say evolved incorrectly. Instead of generic content that gets modified to individual users preference, we have the inverse, every site has some special functionality/code and therefore needs a web designer. This is not only increasing complexity, but also cost. With generic web, anyone could make a web page, no coding required, and anyone could read it. You can see that there is actual demand for this, as there are emerging solutions out there that try to solve it. Unfortunately they are solving it the only way possible, by using the current web standards of building stuff on top of more stuff. \n",

If someone comes up with some IoT thing so compelling that you have to have it in your pocket/on your wrist when you're anywhere away from home, that could be a big win.

      "In my case this is what matters most: - Watch what you DRINK, not so much what you eat. Drink water or black coffee/cold-brew or tea most of the time, and turn other beverages into rare treats. Soda is perfectly fine once a week but buy the smallest size and sip it without a straw so that you enjoy it a lot more. (I was shocked at how I could barely finish a tiny Coke by sipping it but somehow I could practically chug one 3x the size just by using a straw. Don't use straws; they increase consumption and keep you from even tasting most of the calories that you're consuming.) - Cook most of your meals, multiple meals at once. Yes, this takes time and it'll take awhile to become any good at it but it's worthwhile. Pick a day, spend 1-2 hours cooking your lunches for the rest of the week. You will tend to fill your shopping lists with more raw vegetables and meat that go a long way. This also keeps you from finding excuses to head to the nearest fast-food place at lunch time. - Do not ever skip a meal, no matter what your weight is. Prefer breakfasts high in protein, like eggs and chicken sausage, with few carbs (not too much of cereal or muffins or similar). - Take every excuse to walk. Find someplace to go a few times a week, like a coffee shop, and walk the entire way. Even when I drive somewhere, I'm never afraid to park the car and walk in (no drive-through, no spending 10 minutes to find that \"good\" parking spot; just walk from somewhere a bit further out). Same thing with stairs versus elevators; and if you take an escalator, walk up the escalator instead of riding it. - Make some effort to build muscle to get some \"free\" calorie consumption. You don't need a lot. The biggest muscles in your body are better at working off calories so if you have limited time, start with your legs. A gym isn't strictly required for a lot of good exercises; you just need to read up on a few things to do and be really consistent about doing sets a few times a week. \n",

The moderation tools and admin support on reddit are comparatively underpowered so for a lot of popular sub-reddits it's very easy for the overall quality to plummet when a tiny group of vocal assholes decides they want to squat there. And for most sub-reddits this just starts a spiral of death as good people decide not to waste their time wading through toxic garbage and just find somewhere else to be, while the toxic minority gets stronger and more brazen. Imagine you have several subscriptions to a bunch of different print magazines. Every couple days a new magazine shows up. Stuff like Scientific American, The Economist, Better Homes and Gardens, National Geographic, TV Guide, Rolling Stone, Cat Fancy, etc. All fine and good. Except sometimes, maybe once every quarter per magazine, maybe less often even, there's some really weird stuff in your magazines. There's a 10 page article praising the KKK in your copy of Rolling Stone. Or there's a thing about how the jews did 9/11. Or the ads in Cat Fancy are all relentlessly making fun of fat people. Or there's an insert in the October edition of Scientific American that's actually a personal letter to you that is filled with hate and vitriol and ends with a plea for you to commit suicide. Who would put up with that? They wouldn't. But that's what people have been asked to deal with on sites like reddit, and it's beyond a reasonable level. How much shit is acceptable in your drinking water? Just a tiny bit? How about just 1 hour a year where the tap pours out 50/50 shit & water? Is that acceptable? No, it's not. There's far too much shit in the drinking water at reddit, the fact that the drinking water is not, in fact, mostly shit is not a defense. \n",

      "I started northern-style shaolin Kung Fu at 20 when I was in college. It was a great program. Very disciplined (scratch your nose without turning around first results in push-ups), very thorough. The warm ups and breathing exercises I learned are my gold standard for a full body workout that doesn't require any more equipment than the floor. Nowadays the gym I go to specializes in Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I haven't gotten into BJJ but I really enjoy Thai boxing. Something us hackers can appreciate is that learning the difference in styles between Kung Fu and Muay Thai is like learning different programming languages: you learn to do more things, or learn how to accomplish the same but in different ways. For example, every move in Kung Fu has a discrete set of states and is meant to be highly controlled. Your feet are almost always flat on the ground and you move by sliding them across the floor so you can always be sure you're on stable ground and your weight is appropriately centered. Muay Thai, on the other hand, is always in a state of flow. You rock back and forth between your forward foot and the balls of your back foot so that you're lighter on your feet and more able to react to various attacks. If you ever watch boxers/Thai boxers warming up, you'll notice that jump ropes are a common sight. \n",

      "Compelling to do good things and compelling to prevent bad things are a duality. They're equivalent in their effects, and you can easily transform one to the other. Punishing people for doing wrong is compelling them to receive a punishment deemed good. \"Thou must go to jail.\" \"Personal autonomy. Your body, your choice.\" That's a nice slogan, but it isn't actually realized anywhere. It's always your choice when there's a clear advantage -- that is, when the state doesn't \"know best\" about your body. And it absolutely reserves the right control your body for the greater good. \"Can the state compel everyone to be a vegan unless they can show proof of a medical condition that would make it unworkable?\" They can if there is good evidence to show a vegan diet is strictly superior to all others. So for a more appropriate example, it can compel you to use a seatbelt in an automobile, because there are real social costs to not doing so. It doesn't matter if you want to take a risk, once you go to the hospital, you are utilizing a public resource. And the state has a responsibility to ensure those resources are available and used efficiently, which means preventing unnecessary emergencies.

We're not talking about a life or death situation here, we're talking about a company's profits vs. the will of the people. The population of a country should have the final say in what they want to do with their country, if a government makes a bad decision on their behalf that benefits companies over people that's their mistake.

      "Jacob, you are conflating a couple of things in my comment. So there is \"RPM\" for a web site and there is RPM for a web page . No doubt you run analytics on your site to track who goes to which pages and which pages generate the most advertising revenue. In my experience the \"landing\" page gets a lot of traffic, the \"spokes\" pages (typically branches to a bunch of related content) come next, and then there are the articles, some of which get a lot of traffic and some which get only a few page views a day/week. You also probably track dwell time so that you can recognize people who land on the page, probably from a Search engine result, and then \"bounce\" off because it wasn't what they wanted. Or stay and read. Or the unicorn of the bunch, stay, read, and then read a bunch of other pages. I've also been an author in both the print and web world, my columns on JavaWorld continue to get page views and I continue to get various folks popping over to my poorly maintained web site to grab a copy of the sources. While I'm sure there are probably people who have read my BYTE and Dr. Dobbs articles that is harder to track long term. The point being that I'm pretty familiar with the space and if you're looking for median values for revenue for a given article, its \"large\" and it became small enough to result in folks like Dr. Dobbs dropping out entirely. Web page revenue, which generally represents one article for a journalist, is \"good\" if it has $3 RPMs and that is super great if it is getting a lot of traffic. Number 2, the web is often times \"one and done\" for articles , not web sites but web articles . So if you're a journalist or an author that has a loyal following, folks will come back and read new articles that appear, but they don't generally read the same article again and again.[1] Given that you're running a site, and no doubt you have analytics on that site, how many times does the same person come back to an article? What is the 25th, 50th, and 99th percentiles? If you're 99th percentile breaks 1.15 I'm going to be super impressed. So lets unpack #3, the money shot (no pun intended) Lets start with your writer who was paid $100 to create an article[2]. Setting aside the unreality of someone doing their best work in 4 hours, you have to consider how information gets \"value\" to consumers, there really is only a few ways, it's \"rare\" (which means few alternate sources), it's \"timely\" (which means alternate sources don't have it yet), or it's \"enriched\" (which means the information contributes to a bigger understanding). So how much value is your author creating here? Do they have the inside scoop on a big deal? Or maybe they are the first with the complete picture, or maybe they have been following a topic for years and can put it all in perspective for people just coming into contact with this thing or concept. That is what creates value in the piece. If they are paraphrasing an AP press release? (or any press release for that matter), or adding a bit of irrelevant trivia to a bigger story, or regurgitating something which has been covered by 16 other authors already in different ways, there is very little in the way of \"value\" in that writing. Information can demand a price commensurate with its value. While people complain that the NYTimes is a \"paywall\" they have reached 1M digital subscribers today. Those are people who have paid them money because they expect the value of the information they will get out of the NYTimes will be high relative to the price. So let us look a bit critically at your numbers. \"They would need 30k readers to pay 1/3 of a cent in order to break even just on the cost of the article. That is absolutely insane and impossible for most articles.\" Fred Langa, who was the Editor-in-Chief at BYTE advised me as follows when I wrote for him, \"Chuck, the idea article for us would interest all our readers, but that only rarely happens, you should shoot for being interesting to 1/2 to 3/4ths of the readership.\" Their subscription base was a couple of million readers, so that was targeting 1.5M people. There are over a billion people who use the Web today, a large fraction get most of their information from it. If you're unable to get 30K page views for an article, then I would suggest that either the information it contained was not valuable, or that nobody knew of its existence. The second thing working in your favor today is that the Web never forgets. If you want to read an article of mine in BYTE you have either find a reprint or find some kind soul who has scanned it into the web. But if it was online to begin with (like my Javaworld columns) then people find them again and again and again. Some of those have over 5 million page views. And that is over 20 years. So you write something today, and then it can live forever for pennies a day (a Digital Ocean web server to serve it up is $5/month which can be amortized over all the things you are keeping alive on the web). If you're going to write on the web to make money, make it something worthwhile to a million people. Not three or four thousand. If you are just passionate about something feel free to spend all your time writing about it, that is its own reward and any remuneration is just bonus. [1] The exception for fan fiction is noted. [2] I don't think that would be a particularly good investment in time unless someone was just passionate about what they are writing about. \n",

      "I'd like to see more details on this: > In order to be convicted under the CFAA, the damage had to exceed $5,000. The government claimed that Keys caused $929,977.00 worth of damage. During the trial, the defense tried to cast doubt on the total damages, claiming that the expenditures in response to the hack were not reasonable, and Tribune employees had grossly inflated the hours spent on incident response. In a previous article from VICE, it is mentioned that the defense referred to an email from Keys's ex-boss, which suggested (to some other Tribune exec?) “If you bill a thousand dollars an hour, that will help us get it prosecuted.” [1] Maybe that statement is taken out of context...because I can't believe that the Tribune company would spend less than $5,000 to do an audit of their system after it got so thoroughly compromised...then again, the Tribune company is often considered to be a shitshow even compared to news organizations in general, so it wouldn't be surprised if a news executive had no fucking clue about how much damage an online hack could do. The case itself is evidence of their technological savvy: Exhibit A: The login credentials for a fired web producer were not revoked. Exhibit B: A web producer for a Sacramento TV news website has the same privileges as a front-page web producer at the LA Times...I know the Tribune owns both news sites (as well as many others nationwide), that doesn't mean their web producers should have universal editing privileges. So I could see the damages for the incident being $5,000+ for normal security consulting fees...but $900K+? Again, hard to know if that's really what the Tribune ended up paying because of their disorganization, or if it's number dreamed up by a rabid prosecution.

      "> What general purpose computers (even phones and tablets) do you see going this direction Windows. Microsoft, as usual, is late to the party, but Win10 is clearly a step towards the walled garden model. It's not there yet , but stuff like their built in app store and removing choice form the user betray the direction MS intends to take Windows. Intel CPUs. Why do you think there has been a push for SecureBoot and the new SGX instructions? Hardware support is needed if you want to change WinTel boxen form a General Purpose Computer into a locked down appliance. That hardware support now exists in Skylake and later Intel CPUs. Intel even says on their website that the SGX instructions are about creating \"trusted\" enclaves that software vendors can use that cannot be accessed by someone with physical hardware access. > So when is this slippery slope going to start? It started many years ago. Some of us have been warning about these problems for almost twenty years. When we warned that these technologies were coming, we were laughed at because the threat didn't exist yet. When implementations started to show up, we were ignored because nobody was using those tools yet to lock down systems. Now they are slowly starting to turn on, and you've been given yet another warning. Do you intend to wait until the OS is fully locked down? Or do you want to start to fight for your right to run a General Purpose Computer while you s till have the ability to do so? Today there was even a thread on HN about homebrew having to work around OSX \"System Integrity Protection\". Sure, you can disable SIP by jumping through a few technical hoops most people won't understand. Are you going to fight back against this trend, or are you going to wait until you cannot disable SIP \"for security reasons\"? Just because you've been ignoring these steps doesn't mean they are not happening. > TPM The TPM is only key storage and hashing to check the bootstrap chain-of-trust. The TPM never had any \"locking\" features. Why are you ignoring all the other hardware changes that have happened after the TPM? Active Management Technology (AMT), Software Guard Extensions (SGX), and UEFI SecureBoot have all happened after the TPM. > And what about users who want a phone that is locked down for security purposes? You know what would work a lot better? A hardware switch that had to be flipped to install (sudo) software, and had to be flipped back to boot as normal. > Why shouldn't we be able to choose the phones we want Of course you have that choice. That doesn't mean it's a smart choice. You're pushing the (incorrect) assumption that security is in conflict with the end user being able to control their own property. Locking your car door does not require giving up your ability to modify the car's engine. There are other ways to provide security. More importantly, the concept of freedom means that some people will do stupid things with that freedom, but we respect their right to make those mistakes.

I live by the maxim that \"if you loan money to a friend, be prepared to lose the money or the friend.\" Still, you want to help your friends out, right? Thing is, sometimes those friends (or other folks) have friends who enable them. Maybe it's to go out to the bars at night or buy a new game so they can play together.

I could make more accurate predictions, but there will always be gaps. I always feel uncomfortable having personal conversations over Facebook because I always feel like someone's looking over my shoulder. Or maybe I don't want the communication remembered. Either way, it's a blank spot that can't be confirmed or denied, so it will always be an imperfect, some might say discriminatory measure. I'm reminded of the scene in Gattaca when the protagonist is born and instantly a doctor preforms a DNA test to show all the disadvantages he's statistically likely to experience in life: asthma, ADHD, and so on.

If 70% of your users rate it a +2 on a scale of -5 to +5, and 30% rate it -4, that would seem to meet your scenario, but is that really a good goal, to be barely tolerable to a \"mere\" 30%?

Around here at least, it's weird to bake the assumption of a non-large product into your design philosophy. You don't want to have a large, diverse userbase?

      "I rather like this line of thought: On a tangent, many cities currently limit population and job densities in areas to keep vehicle traffic at a manageable levels. Except that is based on the supposition that, no matter what. people are going to travel by cars, or maybe that being able to own a car and to use it is a basic right. In fact, people have different ways of getting around, and those without cars are even forced to find other ways of getting around. So if you want to limit vehicle trips to avoid congesting the road network, instead of restricting population/job density, why not restrict vehicle density by restricting the number of parking spots available? That way, you can restrict vehicle trips without actually restricting development unduly. At one time, I was pursuing an Environmental Resource Management degree with intent to later get a Master's in Urban Planning. I gave up my car some years ago.

One of the causes of this is odd regulation. 3) People seem to say that pills for psychiatric use are no better than placebo (not true) but that pills for physical health (eg hypertension) are better than placebo (true) but those people should also look at the effect size, which is often similar for both types of meds. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20241/abstrac...
