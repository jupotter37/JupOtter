    "# Chapter 7: Python Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier chapters we have been discussing objects, the functions you can perform on them, and how you can make them. In this chapter we will finally have a look at the source of all those objects and making our own. We will discuss how to make classes, create objects from them and some basic concepts of \"object-oriented\" programming. I would like to note that Python is not a true object-oriented, like C# or Java, so some implementation of the concepts might seem strange if you are somewhat familiar with those languages. I will add explanations of these concepts, as I do think they are important to understand what is going on. This will also make it easier if you ever want to work in more strict object-oriented languages. Nevertheless, classes and objects are an integral part of Python, and they are very useful to learn.\n",

These will limit access to the properties in a conventional way, but it is still possible to access them. The most common access modifiers are:\n",

In this case the property name will change from `my_private_property` to `_MyClass__my_private_property`. This one we can access directly too, but this really shouldn't happen.

This allows for all the collections to behave the same when used in loops, and it makes it so that once a modification to the `Itarable` behaviour needs to be made, we can do so only in that class and all the different collections will immediately work in the new manner.

    "In the previous sections, we have defined classes and instantiated those. However, sometimes you have classes that do not have a specific implementation, but are used to define a common interface for a group of classes. These classes are called abstract classes. In Python, you can define an abstract class by using the `ABC` class from the `abc` module. Furthermore, since Python is not a strict object-oriented language like Java, you can still instantiate an abstract class. However, you cannot instantiate an abstract class that has abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods that are defined in the abstract class but do not have an implementation. Let me demonstrate this by defining `Animal` as an abstract class.

Keep in mind however, that enums are mostly 'syntactic sugar', and you can achieve the same thing with a dictionary or a list. Enums just make it easier to read and write for the developer.

    "## Software Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Design patterns are a way of solving common problems. Throughout the years, many people have found ways of efficiently solving a common problem. These solutions have been formalized in so-called patterns. For example, if we ever only need exactly 1 object of class and no more, for example for managing database connections, we can use the 'Singleton' pattern. By applying this pattern in your code you make sure that there will ever only exist one object of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many patterns for many situations. If you're interested in knowing more you can have a look online, for example at [Refactoring Guru - Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). They provide an overview of the most popular patterns, how to use them and some introductory context on where they are applicable.\n",

    "UML stands for Unified Modelling Language. These are a set of standards which define certain diagrams that are used in the design phase of software. They help show developers and clients how the software will be designed. One of these diagrams is the UML Class Diagram. The reason I want to take a short time to explain this, is because of the website I mentioned with the design patterns. A lot of the patterns have this diagram included to convey how the pattern should be structured. Here is an example:\n",

    "Every class in the diagram is divided into three compartments. The top compartment shows the name of the class. The middle compartment shows the properties of that class and their corresponding data types. The `+` or `-` sign at the start of the property indicates if the property is public or private, correspondingly. The final compartment shows the functions, sometimes their parameters and all the corresponding types. "

    "Finally, I would like to mention the SOLID principle. SOLID is an abbreviation of multiple object-oriented programming principles that help to structure your software in such a way that it will be easy to use and maintain, both for you and for future developers looking at the code. Once again, I will not discuss them here as I feel Python is not the right langauge to teach these principles in (Python does not even support all of it), but they might help you transition to other, more object-oriented languages. As someone who was thought programming in Java and C#, consciously or subconsciously, these principles have always stuck with me and are now intuitive when writing new software.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good overview of the principles can be found here: [Digital Ocean - SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)\n",
    "\n",
    "A small note about the article, however. The term interfaces is used a lot. Interfaces are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming, but are not supported in Python. They can be simulated by making an abstract class (like `Animal`) and making sure that every method is abstract, but this is not quite what an interface is other more object-oriented languages. In languages like Java and C# they are there to tell a class to implement which functions to support that interface, so other parts of the code are able to use it. They are not quite the same as een abstract class, but I will spare you the explanation about their nuanced differences.\n"
