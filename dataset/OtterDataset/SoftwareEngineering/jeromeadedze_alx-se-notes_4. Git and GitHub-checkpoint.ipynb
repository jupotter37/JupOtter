    "# Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Understanding Version Control Let's Look At This Scenario (pt.1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine You are building a software product with a group of friends (***Friend A*** and ***Friend B***) in different countries.\n",
    "- Let's say the product is a streaming platform like Netflix\n",
    "- Now everyone is assigned a project to work on for the development of the software. ***You*** are responsible for working on the ***Streaming page***, ***Friend A*** is working on the ***User page*** and ***Friend B*** is working on the ***Payment page***\n",
    "- Keep it in mind that everyone is basically working on their ***page (project)*** independently (meaning they are constantly making changes to modified their page without the other members seeing it)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now ask yourself this question...\n",
    "- How will you collaborate when Friend A and B is done with their page since they are working on the sofware remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This is where version control system comes in...\n",
    "- With a version control system, You get to upload all your files regarding your project(streaming page) to a central repository/directory that creates a snapshot/checkpoint of the latest version/update everytime you make modifications(i.e make changes to a file or add a new file).\n",
    "- When Friend A also upload the files of their projects it creates a snapshot of this modification, same thing happens with Friend B.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there's any modifications or changes made to each project when developing the software a snapshot is created\n",
    "\n",
    "Now these snapshots are known as ***different versions*** which are bascilly the state of the project at a particular time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means Each versions will contain a number of files stored at particular time and the changes you have made so far between the previous version and the current version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how a version control system works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Now What is Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. These versions are recorded in a repository and call be recalled anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The process of monitoring/tracking and managing changes to software code is known as ***version control***, also sometimes referred to as revision control or source control systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a “version control system”? \n",
    "\n",
    "Version control systems are a category of software tools that implement version control. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Version Control\n",
    "1. Local Version Control\n",
    "2. Centralized Version Control\n",
    "3. Distributed Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary on why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a software product is developed in collaboration with a group of developers. These developers might be located at different locations and each one of them contributes to some specific kind of functionality/features. So in order to contribute to the product, they make modifications to the source code(either by adding or removing).\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is the software that helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps collaborations\n",
    "- Allows remote developments\n",
    "- All versions are presaved\n",
    "- Easy rollback"

    "## Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a ***Distributed Version Control*** tool which supports distributed non-linear workflows and allows multiple developers from anywhere to work on a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- distributed non-linear workflows\" refers to the ability of Git to support collaborative development where multiple developers work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments simultaneously in an independent and decentralized manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's look at another scenario(pt.2)..\n",
    "\n",
    "- While working on a really important word document what do you usually do?....\n",
    "\n",
    "- You probably save it on your computer and kept saving as you progress just so you did not lose all your hardwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes if you would go step further to backup those word documents on a cloud storage or external storage to prevent losing that document incase your pc crushes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a case where you are working with a group of people (maybe a presentation) you might share this word document to them and have them edit or add on to the document \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now ask yourself these questions?....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How will I easily see the changes my group members have added to the document ? (these changes might not be noticable )\n",
    "- What if I do not like the final draft and want to go back to a previous version, can I do that?\n",
    "- What if my group members are in distant location, how can i share the document and how can they share their suggested contributions simultaneously?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Git solves this problem not with ***word documents but with codes.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "With Git, you can:\n",
    "1. make save points/checkpoints \n",
    "2. roll back to previous save points/checkpoints\n",
    "3. share current saved points on GitHub so that others can see\n",
    "4. backup save points on cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Git enables you to take ***snapshots*** or save points \n",
    "(like checkpoints in a video game) this allows you to roll back to any previous ***snapshot/checkpoint.***\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done by making a `git commit` ***(term for creating a snapshot/checkpoint)***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another scenario of Git (pt.3):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a video game after progressing to a certain level we usually save a checkpoint before quitting. </br>\n",
    "When we resume the game, we pick up exactly where we left.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the gameplay we may have earned new items like weapons. We would usually save a checkpoint again so that we do not lose these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fighting a boss in a game we usually save our progress before the fight so that incase we lose the fight we can go back to the period before the boss fight. (Branching)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Common Terms\n",
    "1. Repository - It is a ***directory/folder/storage space*** where a project's files, folders, and version history are stored / can live. It can be made available locally to a folder on your computer or a storage space on an online host like ***Github***\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GitHub - It is a hosting platform for central repositories.(a central repository refers to a single, shared location where a project is stored and managed)\n",
    "\n",
    "a project's files, folders, and version history are stored\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Git\n",
    "1. open your terminal\n",
    "2. Install homebrew if you don't already have it, then: \n",
    "type `brew install git` in your terminal"

    "## Basic Git Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `git init`: creates a new git repository. It can also be used to convert an ***existing unversioned project*** to a git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the command `git init` in a directory, it initializes a new ***.git*** repository in that location. This means that Git sets up the necessary data structures and directories to start tracking changes to files within that directory and its subdirectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there's an existing git repository in the directory it simple re-initializes it(i.e it doesn't overwrite anything but rather picks up new files)\n",
    "\n",
    "An ***existing unversioned project*** refers to a project without any version control system in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: Most `git commands` are only available once a git repository is created. So `git init` is usually the first command used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `git clone`: targets an existing repository and creates a clone or copy of the targetted repository locally on your computer. (This downloads the project to a folder named after the Git repository)\n",
    "    -  It is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.\n",
    "    - Cloning to a specific folder - `git clone <repo> <directory>`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `git add <file_name>` : adds changes(new file or modified file) in the current directory which will be snapshotted/checkpoint to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `git commit` : Adds everything from the staging area to the git history repository. (Takes a snapshot/Makes a checkpoint/savepoint)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: ***committing*** refers to term for creating a snapshot/checkpoint of the current state/version of a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "---> `git commit -m \"some_commit_message\"` : The `m` tag is usually added to help include a brief explanation of what was modified in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `git status` : lists modified files that has been added to the staging area which are ready to be added to the respository (committed). (basically lets you see which changes have been staged) \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "6. `git log` :  displays information and details about the commits that have been made in a Git repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Master Branch( ***Currently changed to Main Branch***): It is the default name given to the first branch present in a Git repository when it is initialized. It is the repository where all changes eventually get merged back into.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Origin*** is the remote repository from where we cloned our local repository(***create a local copy of a remote repository***) and where we push and pull changes to it. (this is where all modifications flows to and fro)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is a conventional remote repository name in Git. When you clone a repository from GitHub the remote repository is typically assigned a url which is conventionally named ***origin***. The origin represents the original repository from which you obtained the codebase. \n",
    "    - It ***serves as a reference to interact with the remote repository***, allowing you to fetch updates, push changes, and synchronize your local copy with the remote version.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `git pull` : used to retrieve and download content from a remote repository and update the local repository as soon as it has been downloaded. The `git pull` command is used to ***fetch and merge*** code changes from the remote repository to the local repository. Git pull is a combination of two commands, `git fetch` followed by `git merge`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(pulling means imports)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `git push`: used to transfer the local repository content to a remote repository. Also after a local repository has been modified, a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team members. \n",
    "( pushing means exports )\n",
    "\n",
    "### To use git push or pull you need to...\n",
    "\n",
    "- set the central repository(remote repository) as `origin` this refers to configuring the remote repository from which you cloned your local repository as the default remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command is `git remote add origin <add_link_to_repository>` <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing this you can use `git push` or `git pull` commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `git pull/push orgin <branch_name>`. <br/>\n",
    "An example is `git pull orgin main`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `git remote` : used to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git remote` : lists the remote connections you have to other repositories.\n",
    "- `git remote -v` : does the same thing but includes the url of each connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### we can also create,remove and rename git remotes connections using....\n",
    "- `git remote add <name_of_remote_connection> <url>`,\n",
    "- `git remote rm <name_of_remote_connection>`,\n",
    "- `git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember when you clone a repository, Git automatically sets up a remote url called `origin` that points to the source repository you cloned from. This allows you to easily interact with the remote repository, such as fetching updates and pushing your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NB: This only applies to creating(downloading) a local copy of a remote repository, if you initialize a Git repository locally using the git init command, it doesn't have a remote origin set by default.\n",
    "To establish a remote origin for the locally initialized repository, you need to use the `git remote add` command***\n",
    "\n",
    "- By designating the central repository as \"origin,\" it becomes the default remote repository for your local repository. This means that you don't have to specify the remote repository url each time you want to interact with it using commands like `git fetch`, `git pull`, or `git push`.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: `origin` is the conventional shorthand name of the url for the remote repository (usually in GitHub or another cloud git repository provider) for your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Branch: https://www.toolsqa.com/git/branch-in-git/\n",
    "\n",
    "Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central part of the tree called the trunk. While branches can generate and fall off, the trunk remains compact and is the only part by which we can say the tree is alive and standing. Similarly, ***a branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding a new feature or modification to the software and still not affecting the main part of the project***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary or default branch in Git is the main branch (similar to a trunk of the tree). As soon as the repository creates, so does the main branch (or the default branch).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a) `git branch`: displays the name of the current active branch\n",
    "\n",
    "b) `git branch <branch_name>`: Creates a new branch of the main branch\n",
    "\n",
    "c) `git checkout <branch_name>`: switch active branch to specified existing branch name.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) `git merge <branch_name>`: merges branch commits to the current active branch. \n",
    "(we first use `git checkout` to switch to the branch you want to merge to)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More commands\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git config` : used to configure Git on your system. It allows you to set and modify various settings that control how Git behaves. Eg. We can set user information, ......\n",
    "---> `git config --global user.email enter_your_email@gmail.com`\n",
    "---> `git config --global user.email`: displays entered email\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git fetch`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. ****Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.*** It lets you see how the central history has progressed, but it doesn’t force you to actually merge the changes into your local repository.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- It will download the remote content but not update your local repo's working state, leaving your current work intact.\n",
    "- The git fetch command gets all the changes from a remote repository. The fetched metadata resides in the .git directory, while the working directory stays unaltered.\n",

    "Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple developers or other contributors to work on a project. It provides a way to work with one or more local branches and push them to a remote repository. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. \n",

    "<a>Non-linear workflow<a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A non-linear workflow in software development refers to a development process where changes to the codebase are made in a non-sequential or non-linear manner. In other words, developers may work on multiple tasks or features simultaneously, without strictly following a sequential order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a non-linear workflow, developers may create multiple branches or forks of the codebase to work on different tasks independently. Each branch can represent a specific feature, bug fix, or experiment. Developers can switch between branches, make changes, and merge them back into the main codebase when they are ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear workflows are often used in situations where different development tasks or features can be developed concurrently without dependencies on each other. This approach allows for increased flexibility and parallel development, as developers can work on different aspects of a project simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-linear workflows can be supported by version control systems like Git, which provide features for creating and managing branches, merging changes, and resolving conflicts that may arise when multiple developers make changes to the same codebase. These features allow developers to collaborate effectively and integrate their changes into the main codebase when they are ready.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<a> Central Repository <a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The central repository serves as a centralized point where developers can push their changes, share their work, and collaborate. It contains the collective history of all changes made to the project, including different branches, commits, and version tags. Other developers can then pull the changes from the central repository to their local copies and merge them with their own work.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "<a>Local repository: <a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A local repository is located on your own machine or development environment. It is a directory on your computer where Git tracks and manages changes to your project's files. The local repository contains the entire history of commits, branches, and other Git-related metadata.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "<a>Remote repository: <a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "A remote repository is a separate repository located on a different server or hosting platform, which may be accessed over a network or the internet. Remote repositories provide a central location for collaboration and sharing code with others.\n",
    "Remote repositories can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or a self-hosted Git server. They serve as a common repository where multiple developers can push their changes and pull updates from.\n",

    "    \n",
    "1. Developing Sequentially: This approach involves completing tasks or features in a sequential order, one after another. Each task is typically worked on and completed before moving on to the next one. In sequential development, the development team follows a linear progression, where each task or feature is dependent on the completion of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Developing in Parallel: This approach involves working on multiple tasks or features simultaneously. Different team members or teams may be assigned to work on different parts of the project concurrently. The goal is to expedite development by leveraging parallelization and enabling various tasks to progress in parallel.\n",
