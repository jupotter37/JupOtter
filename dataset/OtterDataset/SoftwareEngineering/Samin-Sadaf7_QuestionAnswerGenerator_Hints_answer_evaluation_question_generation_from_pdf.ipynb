It provides an area for the attachment of muscles.PECULIARITIESThe peculiar features of the clavicle are as follows:1. It is the only long bone which lies horizontally.2. It has no medullary cavity.3. It is subcutaneous throughout its extent.4. It is the first bone to start ossifying (between the fifth and sixth week of intrauterine life) and last bone to complete its ossification (at 25 years).5. It is the only long bone which ossifies by two primary centers.6. It is the only long bone which ossifies in membrane except for its medial end (cf. long bones ossify in cartilage).7. It may be pierced through and through by cutaneous nerve (intermediate supraclavicular nerve).PARTSThe clavicle consists of three parts: two ends (medial and lateral) and a shaft (Fig. 2.2):Ends1. The lateral (acromial) end is flattened above downwards and articulates with medial margin of the acromion process.2. The medial (sternal) end is enlarged and quadrilateral. It articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni.ShaftThe shaft is curved. Its medial two-third is round and convex forwards, and its lateral one-third is flattened and concave forwards. The inferior surface of the shaft possesses a small longitudinal groove in its middle third.ANATOMICAL POSITION AND SIDE DETERMINATIONThe side of clavicle can be determined by holding the bone horizontally in such a way that its flattened end is on the lateral side and its enlarged quadrilateral end is on the medial side. The convexity of its medial two-third and concavity of its lateral one-third face forwards with longitudinal groove in the middle third of shaft facing inferiorly.FEATURES AND ATTACHMENTS (Fig. 2.3)Lateral End/Acromial EndIt is flattened above downwards. An oval facet on this end articulates with the facet on the medial margin of the acromion to form acromioclavicular joint. The lateral end provides attachment to fibrous capsule of acromioclavicular joint.Medial End/Sternal EndThe enlarged medial end has a saddle-shaped articular surface, which articulates with the clavicular notch of manubrium sterni to form sternoclavicular joint. It provides attachment to (a) fibrous capsule (b) articular disc, and (c) interclavicular ligament.\n",

            "ShaftThe shaft of the clavicle is divided into two parts: lateral one-third and medial two-third. The medial two-third of shaft is convex forward and lateral one-third is concave forward.Lateral One-thirdIt is flattened from above downwards. It has two surfaces, i.e., superior and inferior, and two borders, i.e., anterior and posterior.SurfacesSuperior surface: It is subcutaneous between the attachments of deltoid and trapezius.Inferior surface: I t  p r e s e n t s  a  conoid tubercle and trapezoid ridge, w h i c h  p r o vi d e  a t t a c h m e n t s  t o  c o n o i d  a n d  trapezoid parts of coracoclavicular ligament, respectively.The conoid tubercle is located on the inferior surface near the posterior border at the junction of the lateral one-fourth and medial three-fourth of the clavicle.

            "end of clavicle rises higher than the manubrium, hence it poorly fits into its shallow socket. But a strong thick articular disc of fibrocartilage attached superiorly to the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage inferiorly prevents the displacement of the medial end of the clavicle.The articular surface of clavicle is convex from above downwards and slightly concave from front to back. The articular surface of sternum is reciprocally curved. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage.Articular CapsuleThe joint capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces including the periphery of the articular disc. The synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous joint capsule, extending to the edges of the articular disc.Ligaments1. Anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments:They reinforce the joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior ligament is weaker than the anterior ligament.2.

In between, it is attached to the superior border of the suprasternal notch.3. Costoclavicular ligament: It anchors the inferior surface of the sternal end of clavicle to the first rib and adjoining part of its cartilage.MovementsThe sternoclavicular joint allows the movements of pectoral girdle. This joint is critical to the movement of the clavicle.• Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: It is rare because the sternoclavicular (SC) joint is extremely strong. However, dislocation of this joint in people below 25 years of age may result from fractures through the epiphyseal plate because epiphysis at the sternal end of clavicle does not unite until 23–25 years of age. The medial end is usually dislocated anteriorly. Backward dislocation is prevented by the costoclavicu-lar ligament.• Transmission of weight of the upper limb: The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from scapula to the clavicle through coracoclavicular ligament, and then from clavicle to sternum through sternoclavicular joint. Some of the weight is transmitted to the first rib through costoclavicular ligament (Fig. 1.4). When a person falls on the outstretched hand the force of blow is usually transmitted along the length of the clavicle, i.e., along its long axis. The clavicle may fracture at the junction of its middle and lateral third but it is rare for the SC joint to dislocate.• Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint: It may occur following a severe blow on the superolateral part of the shoulder. In severe form, both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn. Consequently the shoulder separates from the clavicle and falls because of the weight of the limb. The acromioclavicular joint dislocation is often termed shoulder separation.Clinical correlation\n",

            "OSSIFICATION (Fig. 2.5)The ossification of clavicle is membranocartilaginous. Whole of it ossifies in the membrane except its medial end which ossifies in the cartilage. The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. It ossifies by four ossification centres – two primary centres for shaft and two secondary centres, one for each end.The site of appearance, time of appearance, and time of fusion of various centres is given in the Table 2.2.N.B. Growing end of clavicle: The sternal end of clavicle is its growing end, because epiphysis at this end appears at the age of 19–20 years and unites with the shaft at the age of 25 years. It is the last of all the epiphyses in the body to fuse with the shaft. The radiological appearance of this epiphysis in females confirms their bone age for legal consent to marriage.Congenital anomalies:• Clavicular dysostosis: It is a clinical condition in which medial and lateral parts of clavicle remain separate due to nonunion of two primary centers of ossification.• Cleidocranial dysostosis: It is a clinical condition characterized by partial or complete absence of clavicle associated with defective ossification of the skull bones.Clinical correlationFracture of clavicle (Fig. 2.4): The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. It commonly fractures at the junction of its lateral one-third and medial two-third due to blows to the shoulder or indirect forces, usually as a result of strong impact on the hand or shoulder, when person falls on the outstretched hand or the shoulder. When fracture occurs, the lateral fragment is displaced downward by the weight of the upper limb because trapezius alone is unable to support the weight of the upper limb. In addition, the lateral fragment is drawn medially by shoulder adductors viz. teres major, etc. The medial fragment is slightly elevated by the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The characteristic clinical picture of the patient with fractured clavicle is that of a man/woman supporting his sagging upper limb with the opposite hand. The fracture at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-third occurs because: (a) This is the weakest site.(b) Two curvatures of clavicle meet at this site.(c) The transmission of forces (due to impact) from the clavicle to scapula occur at this site through coracoclavicular ligament.Clinical correlation\n",

Therefore, a sound understanding of its structure and functions is of great clinical significance—the ultimate aim of treating any ailment of the upper limb being to restore its function.The upper limbs are connected to the trunk by a pectoral girdle. The limb girdle is defined as the bones which connect the limbs to the axial skeleton. The p e c t o r a l  g i r d l e  is composed of two bones – scapula and clavicle. The scapula is connected to the clavicle by the acromioclavicular joint, and the clavicle is attached to the axial skeleton by the sternoclavicular joint. The pectoral girdle is not a complete girdle because it is attached to the axial skeleton only anteriorly. The primary function of the pectoral girdle is to provide attachment to numerous muscles, which move the arm and forearm. It is not weight bearing and is, therefore, more delicate as compared to the pelvic girdle. Note that pelvic girdle is a complete girdle.N.B. Only one small joint (sternoclavicular joint) connects the skeleton of upper limb to the rest of the skeleton of the body.PARTS OF THE UPPER LIMBFor descriptive purposes, the upper limb is divided into the following four parts (Fig. 1.2):1. Shoulder.2. Arm or brachium.3. Forearm or antebrachium.4. Hand.The shoulder region includes: (a) axilla or armpit, (b) scapular region or parts around the scapula (shoulder blade), and (c) pectoral or breast region on the front of the chest.The bones of the shoulder region are the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). They articulate with each other at the acromioclavicular joint and form the shoulder girdle. The shoulder girdle articulates with the rest of the skeleton of the body only at the small sternoclavicular joint.The arm is the part of the upper limb between the shoulder and elbow (or cubitus). The bone of the arm is humerus, which articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint and upper ends of radius and ulna at the elbow joint.The forearm is the part of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist. The bones of the forearm are radius and ulna. These bones articulate with humerus at the elbow joint and with each other forming radio-ulnar joints.The hand (or manus) consists of the following parts: (a) wrist or carpus, (b) hand proper (or metacarpus), and (c) digits (thumb and fingers).The wrist consists of eight carpal bones arranged in two rows, each consisting of four bones. The carpal bones articulate (a) with each other at intercarpal joints, (b) proximally with radius forming radio-carpal wrist joint, and (c) distally with metacarpal bones at carpometacarpal joints.ClavicleShoulderScapula\n",

The thick upper part of the fascia extending from first rib near costochondral junction to the coracoid process is called costocoracoid ligament.N.B. The clavipectoral fascia encloses two muscles—subclavius and pectoralis minor.Structures Piercing the Clavipectoral FasciaThese are as follows (Fig. 3.11):1. Lateral pectoral nerve.2. Thoraco-acromial artery.3. Lymphatics from the breast to the apical group of axillary group of lymph nodes.4. Cephalic vein. The first two structures pass outwards, whereas the lower two structures pass inwards.BREAST (MAMMARY GLAND)The mammary gland is a modified sweat gland present in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. The mammary gland is found in both sexes. However, it remains rudimentary in male but becomes well-developed in female at puberty. On rare occasions the breasts of male become enlarged, this condition is called gynecomastia. I n  f e m a l e ,  i t  f o r m s  a n  accessory sex organ of female reproductive system and provides milk to the newborn baby. The anatomy of breast is of great surgical importance, and therefore, needs to be studied in detail.LOCATION (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)The breast is located in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. A small extension from its superolateral part (axillary tail of Spence) however pierces the deep fascia and extends into the axilla. The aperture in the deep fascia through which axillary tail passes into the axilla is called foramen of Langer. The axillary tail is the site of high percentage of breast tumor.SHAPE AND EXTENT (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)ShapeHemispherical bulge.Extent1. Ve r t i c a l l y, it extends from 2nd rib to 6th rib.2.

It has no medullary cavity.3. It is subcutaneous throughout its extent.4. It is the first bone to start ossifying (between the fifth and sixth week of intrauterine life) and last bone to complete its ossification (at 25 years).5. It is the only long bone which ossifies by two primary centers.6. It is the only long bone which ossifies in membrane except for its medial end (cf. long bones ossify in cartilage).7. It may be pierced through and through by cutaneous nerve (intermediate supraclavicular nerve).PARTSThe clavicle consists of three parts: two ends (medial and lateral) and a shaft (Fig. 2.2):Ends1. The lateral (acromial) end is flattened above downwards and articulates with medial margin of the acromion process.2. The medial (sternal) end is enlarged and quadrilateral. It articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni.ShaftThe shaft is curved. Its medial two-third is round and convex forwards, and its lateral one-third is flattened and concave forwards. The inferior surface of the shaft possesses a small longitudinal groove in its middle third.ANATOMICAL POSITION AND SIDE DETERMINATIONThe side of clavicle can be determined by holding the bone horizontally in such a way that its flattened end is on the lateral side and its enlarged quadrilateral end is on the medial side. The convexity of its medial two-third and concavity of its lateral one-third face forwards with longitudinal groove in the middle third of shaft facing inferiorly.FEATURES AND ATTACHMENTS (Fig. 2.3)Lateral End/Acromial EndIt is flattened above downwards. An oval facet on this end articulates with the facet on the medial margin of the acromion to form acromioclavicular joint. The lateral end provides attachment to fibrous capsule of acromioclavicular joint.Medial End/Sternal EndThe enlarged medial end has a saddle-shaped articular surface, which articulates with the clavicular notch of manubrium sterni to form sternoclavicular joint. It provides attachment to (a) fibrous capsule (b) articular disc, and (c) interclavicular ligament.\n",

            "end of clavicle rises higher than the manubrium, hence it poorly fits into its shallow socket. But a strong thick articular disc of fibrocartilage attached superiorly to the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage inferiorly prevents the displacement of the medial end of the clavicle.The articular surface of clavicle is convex from above downwards and slightly concave from front to back. The articular surface of sternum is reciprocally curved. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage.Articular CapsuleThe joint capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces including the periphery of the articular disc. The synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous joint capsule, extending to the edges of the articular disc.Ligaments1. Anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments:They reinforce the joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior ligament is weaker than the anterior ligament.2.

In between, it is attached to the superior border of the suprasternal notch.3. Costoclavicular ligament: It anchors the inferior surface of the sternal end of clavicle to the first rib and adjoining part of its cartilage.MovementsThe sternoclavicular joint allows the movements of pectoral girdle. This joint is critical to the movement of the clavicle.• Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: It is rare because the sternoclavicular (SC) joint is extremely strong. However, dislocation of this joint in people below 25 years of age may result from fractures through the epiphyseal plate because epiphysis at the sternal end of clavicle does not unite until 23–25 years of age. The medial end is usually dislocated anteriorly. Backward dislocation is prevented by the costoclavicu-lar ligament.• Transmission of weight of the upper limb: The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from scapula to the clavicle through coracoclavicular ligament, and then from clavicle to sternum through sternoclavicular joint. Some of the weight is transmitted to the first rib through costoclavicular ligament (Fig. 1.4). When a person falls on the outstretched hand the force of blow is usually transmitted along the length of the clavicle, i.e., along its long axis. The clavicle may fracture at the junction of its middle and lateral third but it is rare for the SC joint to dislocate.• Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint: It may occur following a severe blow on the superolateral part of the shoulder. In severe form, both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn. Consequently the shoulder separates from the clavicle and falls because of the weight of the limb. The acromioclavicular joint dislocation is often termed shoulder separation.Clinical correlation\n",

            "OSSIFICATION (Fig. 2.5)The ossification of clavicle is membranocartilaginous. Whole of it ossifies in the membrane except its medial end which ossifies in the cartilage. The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. It ossifies by four ossification centres – two primary centres for shaft and two secondary centres, one for each end.The site of appearance, time of appearance, and time of fusion of various centres is given in the Table 2.2.N.B. Growing end of clavicle: The sternal end of clavicle is its growing end, because epiphysis at this end appears at the age of 19–20 years and unites with the shaft at the age of 25 years. It is the last of all the epiphyses in the body to fuse with the shaft. The radiological appearance of this epiphysis in females confirms their bone age for legal consent to marriage.Congenital anomalies:• Clavicular dysostosis: It is a clinical condition in which medial and lateral parts of clavicle remain separate due to nonunion of two primary centers of ossification.• Cleidocranial dysostosis: It is a clinical condition characterized by partial or complete absence of clavicle associated with defective ossification of the skull bones.Clinical correlationFracture of clavicle (Fig. 2.4): The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. It commonly fractures at the junction of its lateral one-third and medial two-third due to blows to the shoulder or indirect forces, usually as a result of strong impact on the hand or shoulder, when person falls on the outstretched hand or the shoulder. When fracture occurs, the lateral fragment is displaced downward by the weight of the upper limb because trapezius alone is unable to support the weight of the upper limb. In addition, the lateral fragment is drawn medially by shoulder adductors viz. teres major, etc. The medial fragment is slightly elevated by the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The characteristic clinical picture of the patient with fractured clavicle is that of a man/woman supporting his sagging upper limb with the opposite hand. The fracture at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-third occurs because: (a) This is the weakest site.(b) Two curvatures of clavicle meet at this site.(c) The transmission of forces (due to impact) from the clavicle to scapula occur at this site through coracoclavicular ligament.Clinical correlation\n",

Therefore, a sound understanding of its structure and functions is of great clinical significance—the ultimate aim of treating any ailment of the upper limb being to restore its function.The upper limbs are connected to the trunk by a pectoral girdle. The limb girdle is defined as the bones which connect the limbs to the axial skeleton. The p e c t o r a l  g i r d l e  is composed of two bones – scapula and clavicle. The scapula is connected to the clavicle by the acromioclavicular joint, and the clavicle is attached to the axial skeleton by the sternoclavicular joint. The pectoral girdle is not a complete girdle because it is attached to the axial skeleton only anteriorly. The primary function of the pectoral girdle is to provide attachment to numerous muscles, which move the arm and forearm. It is not weight bearing and is, therefore, more delicate as compared to the pelvic girdle. Note that pelvic girdle is a complete girdle.N.B. Only one small joint (sternoclavicular joint) connects the skeleton of upper limb to the rest of the skeleton of the body.PARTS OF THE UPPER LIMBFor descriptive purposes, the upper limb is divided into the following four parts (Fig. 1.2):1. Shoulder.2. Arm or brachium.3. Forearm or antebrachium.4. Hand.The shoulder region includes: (a) axilla or armpit, (b) scapular region or parts around the scapula (shoulder blade), and (c) pectoral or breast region on the front of the chest.The bones of the shoulder region are the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). They articulate with each other at the acromioclavicular joint and form the shoulder girdle. The shoulder girdle articulates with the rest of the skeleton of the body only at the small sternoclavicular joint.The arm is the part of the upper limb between the shoulder and elbow (or cubitus). The bone of the arm is humerus, which articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint and upper ends of radius and ulna at the elbow joint.The forearm is the part of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist. The bones of the forearm are radius and ulna. These bones articulate with humerus at the elbow joint and with each other forming radio-ulnar joints.The hand (or manus) consists of the following parts: (a) wrist or carpus, (b) hand proper (or metacarpus), and (c) digits (thumb and fingers).The wrist consists of eight carpal bones arranged in two rows, each consisting of four bones. The carpal bones articulate (a) with each other at intercarpal joints, (b) proximally with radius forming radio-carpal wrist joint, and (c) distally with metacarpal bones at carpometacarpal joints.ClavicleShoulderScapula\n",

The thick upper part of the fascia extending from first rib near costochondral junction to the coracoid process is called costocoracoid ligament.N.B. The clavipectoral fascia encloses two muscles—subclavius and pectoralis minor.Structures Piercing the Clavipectoral FasciaThese are as follows (Fig. 3.11):1. Lateral pectoral nerve.2. Thoraco-acromial artery.3. Lymphatics from the breast to the apical group of axillary group of lymph nodes.4. Cephalic vein. The first two structures pass outwards, whereas the lower two structures pass inwards.BREAST (MAMMARY GLAND)The mammary gland is a modified sweat gland present in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. The mammary gland is found in both sexes. However, it remains rudimentary in male but becomes well-developed in female at puberty. On rare occasions the breasts of male become enlarged, this condition is called gynecomastia. I n  f e m a l e ,  i t  f o r m s  a n  accessory sex organ of female reproductive system and provides milk to the newborn baby. The anatomy of breast is of great surgical importance, and therefore, needs to be studied in detail.LOCATION (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)The breast is located in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. A small extension from its superolateral part (axillary tail of Spence) however pierces the deep fascia and extends into the axilla. The aperture in the deep fascia through which axillary tail passes into the axilla is called foramen of Langer. The axillary tail is the site of high percentage of breast tumor.SHAPE AND EXTENT (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)ShapeHemispherical bulge.Extent1. Ve r t i c a l l y, it extends from 2nd rib to 6th rib.2.

            "ShaftThe shaft of the clavicle is divided into two parts: lateral one-third and medial two-third. The medial two-third of shaft is convex forward and lateral one-third is concave forward.Lateral One-thirdIt is flattened from above downwards. It has two surfaces, i.e., superior and inferior, and two borders, i.e., anterior and posterior.SurfacesSuperior surface: It is subcutaneous between the attachments of deltoid and trapezius.Inferior surface: I t  p r e s e n t s  a  conoid tubercle and trapezoid ridge, w h i c h  p r o vi d e  a t t a c h m e n t s  t o  c o n o i d  a n d  trapezoid parts of coracoclavicular ligament, respectively.The conoid tubercle is located on the inferior surface near the posterior border at the junction of the lateral one-fourth and medial three-fourth of the clavicle. The trapezoid ridge extends forwards and laterally from conoid tubercle.BordersAnterior border: It is concave forwards and gives origin to deltoid muscle. A small tubercle called deltoid tubercle may be present on this border.Posterior border: I t  i s  c o n v e x  b a c k w a r d s  a n d  p r o v i d e s  insertion to the trapezius muscle.Medial T wo-thirdIt is cylindrical in shape and presents four surfaces: anterior, posterior, superior, and inferior.Anterior surface: It is convex forwards and gives origin to clavicular head of pectoralis major.Posterior surface: It is concave backwards and gives origin to sternohyoid muscle near its medial end. The lateral part of this surface forms the anterior boundary of cervico-axillary canal and is related to the following structures:1. Trunks of brachial plexus.2. Third part of subclavian artery.Superior surface: The clavicular head of sternocleido-mastoid muscle originates from medial half of this surface.Inferior surface: It presents the following features:1.

            "end of clavicle rises higher than the manubrium, hence it poorly fits into its shallow socket. But a strong thick articular disc of fibrocartilage attached superiorly to the clavicle and 1st costal cartilage inferiorly prevents the displacement of the medial end of the clavicle.The articular surface of clavicle is convex from above downwards and slightly concave from front to back. The articular surface of sternum is reciprocally curved. The articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage.Articular CapsuleThe joint capsule is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces including the periphery of the articular disc. The synovial membrane lines the internal surface of the fibrous joint capsule, extending to the edges of the articular disc.Ligaments1. Anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments:They reinforce the joint capsule anteriorly and posteriorly. The posterior ligament is weaker than the anterior ligament.2.

In between, it is attached to the superior border of the suprasternal notch.3. Costoclavicular ligament: It anchors the inferior surface of the sternal end of clavicle to the first rib and adjoining part of its cartilage.MovementsThe sternoclavicular joint allows the movements of pectoral girdle. This joint is critical to the movement of the clavicle.• Dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint: It is rare because the sternoclavicular (SC) joint is extremely strong. However, dislocation of this joint in people below 25 years of age may result from fractures through the epiphyseal plate because epiphysis at the sternal end of clavicle does not unite until 23–25 years of age. The medial end is usually dislocated anteriorly. Backward dislocation is prevented by the costoclavicu-lar ligament.• Transmission of weight of the upper limb: The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from scapula to the clavicle through coracoclavicular ligament, and then from clavicle to sternum through sternoclavicular joint. Some of the weight is transmitted to the first rib through costoclavicular ligament (Fig. 1.4). When a person falls on the outstretched hand the force of blow is usually transmitted along the length of the clavicle, i.e., along its long axis. The clavicle may fracture at the junction of its middle and lateral third but it is rare for the SC joint to dislocate.• Dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint: It may occur following a severe blow on the superolateral part of the shoulder. In severe form, both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn. Consequently the shoulder separates from the clavicle and falls because of the weight of the limb. The acromioclavicular joint dislocation is often termed shoulder separation.Clinical correlation\n",

            "OSSIFICATION (Fig. 2.5)The ossification of clavicle is membranocartilaginous. Whole of it ossifies in the membrane except its medial end which ossifies in the cartilage. The clavicle begins to ossify before any other bone in the body. It ossifies by four ossification centres – two primary centres for shaft and two secondary centres, one for each end.The site of appearance, time of appearance, and time of fusion of various centres is given in the Table 2.2.N.B. Growing end of clavicle: The sternal end of clavicle is its growing end, because epiphysis at this end appears at the age of 19–20 years and unites with the shaft at the age of 25 years. It is the last of all the epiphyses in the body to fuse with the shaft. The radiological appearance of this epiphysis in females confirms their bone age for legal consent to marriage.Congenital anomalies:• Clavicular dysostosis: It is a clinical condition in which medial and lateral parts of clavicle remain separate due to nonunion of two primary centers of ossification.• Cleidocranial dysostosis: It is a clinical condition characterized by partial or complete absence of clavicle associated with defective ossification of the skull bones.Clinical correlationFracture of clavicle (Fig. 2.4): The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone in the body. It commonly fractures at the junction of its lateral one-third and medial two-third due to blows to the shoulder or indirect forces, usually as a result of strong impact on the hand or shoulder, when person falls on the outstretched hand or the shoulder. When fracture occurs, the lateral fragment is displaced downward by the weight of the upper limb because trapezius alone is unable to support the weight of the upper limb. In addition, the lateral fragment is drawn medially by shoulder adductors viz. teres major, etc. The medial fragment is slightly elevated by the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The characteristic clinical picture of the patient with fractured clavicle is that of a man/woman supporting his sagging upper limb with the opposite hand. The fracture at the junction of lateral one-third and medial two-third occurs because: (a) This is the weakest site.(b) Two curvatures of clavicle meet at this site.(c) The transmission of forces (due to impact) from the clavicle to scapula occur at this site through coracoclavicular ligament.Clinical correlation\n",

Therefore, a sound understanding of its structure and functions is of great clinical significance—the ultimate aim of treating any ailment of the upper limb being to restore its function.The upper limbs are connected to the trunk by a pectoral girdle. The limb girdle is defined as the bones which connect the limbs to the axial skeleton. The p e c t o r a l  g i r d l e  is composed of two bones – scapula and clavicle. The scapula is connected to the clavicle by the acromioclavicular joint, and the clavicle is attached to the axial skeleton by the sternoclavicular joint. The pectoral girdle is not a complete girdle because it is attached to the axial skeleton only anteriorly. The primary function of the pectoral girdle is to provide attachment to numerous muscles, which move the arm and forearm. It is not weight bearing and is, therefore, more delicate as compared to the pelvic girdle. Note that pelvic girdle is a complete girdle.N.B. Only one small joint (sternoclavicular joint) connects the skeleton of upper limb to the rest of the skeleton of the body.PARTS OF THE UPPER LIMBFor descriptive purposes, the upper limb is divided into the following four parts (Fig. 1.2):1. Shoulder.2. Arm or brachium.3. Forearm or antebrachium.4. Hand.The shoulder region includes: (a) axilla or armpit, (b) scapular region or parts around the scapula (shoulder blade), and (c) pectoral or breast region on the front of the chest.The bones of the shoulder region are the clavicle (collar bone) and the scapula (shoulder blade). They articulate with each other at the acromioclavicular joint and form the shoulder girdle. The shoulder girdle articulates with the rest of the skeleton of the body only at the small sternoclavicular joint.The arm is the part of the upper limb between the shoulder and elbow (or cubitus). The bone of the arm is humerus, which articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint and upper ends of radius and ulna at the elbow joint.The forearm is the part of the upper limb between the elbow and the wrist. The bones of the forearm are radius and ulna. These bones articulate with humerus at the elbow joint and with each other forming radio-ulnar joints.The hand (or manus) consists of the following parts: (a) wrist or carpus, (b) hand proper (or metacarpus), and (c) digits (thumb and fingers).The wrist consists of eight carpal bones arranged in two rows, each consisting of four bones. The carpal bones articulate (a) with each other at intercarpal joints, (b) proximally with radius forming radio-carpal wrist joint, and (c) distally with metacarpal bones at carpometacarpal joints.ClavicleShoulderScapula\n",

The thick upper part of the fascia extending from first rib near costochondral junction to the coracoid process is called costocoracoid ligament.N.B. The clavipectoral fascia encloses two muscles—subclavius and pectoralis minor.Structures Piercing the Clavipectoral FasciaThese are as follows (Fig. 3.11):1. Lateral pectoral nerve.2. Thoraco-acromial artery.3. Lymphatics from the breast to the apical group of axillary group of lymph nodes.4. Cephalic vein. The first two structures pass outwards, whereas the lower two structures pass inwards.BREAST (MAMMARY GLAND)The mammary gland is a modified sweat gland present in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. The mammary gland is found in both sexes. However, it remains rudimentary in male but becomes well-developed in female at puberty. On rare occasions the breasts of male become enlarged, this condition is called gynecomastia. I n  f e m a l e ,  i t  f o r m s  a n  accessory sex organ of female reproductive system and provides milk to the newborn baby. The anatomy of breast is of great surgical importance, and therefore, needs to be studied in detail.LOCATION (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)The breast is located in the superficial fascia of the pectoral region. A small extension from its superolateral part (axillary tail of Spence) however pierces the deep fascia and extends into the axilla. The aperture in the deep fascia through which axillary tail passes into the axilla is called foramen of Langer. The axillary tail is the site of high percentage of breast tumor.SHAPE AND EXTENT (Figs 3.12 and 3.13)ShapeHemispherical bulge.Extent1. Ve r t i c a l l y, it extends from 2nd rib to 6th rib.2.
