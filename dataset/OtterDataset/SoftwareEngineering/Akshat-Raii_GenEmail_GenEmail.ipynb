      "The concept of heaven varies across cultures, religions, and belief systems, making it challenging to pinpoint a single location. Here are some perspectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Religious views:**\n",
      "\t* Christianity: Heaven is often described as a spiritual realm, a place of eternal life, happiness, and union with God. Some Christian denominations believe it's a physical place, while others see it as a state of being.\n",
      "\t* Islam: Jannah (paradise) is the Islamic concept of heaven, a place of beauty, peace, and bliss, where believers will be rewarded for their good deeds.\n",
      "\t* Judaism: The afterlife is not a central concept in Judaism, but some texts describe a spiritual realm called Olam Ha-Ba (the world to come), where souls will be judged and either rewarded or punished.\n",
      "\t* Hinduism: Svarga (heaven) is a temporary realm where souls enjoy happiness and bliss before being reborn.\n",
      "\t* Buddhism: The concept of heaven is not central to Buddhism, but some texts describe a realm called Svarga (heaven) or Tusita (the realm of the gods), where beings can experience temporary happiness.\n",
      "2. **Astronomical and scientific perspectives:**\n",
      "\t* From a scientific standpoint, there is no empirical evidence to support the existence of a physical heaven. The universe is vast, with billions of galaxies, stars, and planets, but none have been identified as a heavenly realm.\n",
      "\t* Some theories, such as the concept of a multiverse, propose the existence of parallel universes or dimensions, but these ideas are still speculative and not directly related to the concept of heaven.\n",
      "3. **Philosophical and metaphorical interpretations:**\n",
      "\t* Heaven can be seen as a metaphor for a state of being, such as happiness, peace, or fulfillment.\n",
      "\t* Some philosophers argue that heaven is a human construct, a way to make sense of the world and our place in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the concept of heaven is complex and multifaceted, with different meanings and interpretations across cultures and belief systems. While there is no single, definitive answer to where heaven is, it remains a powerful symbol and idea that inspires hope, comfort, and spirituality in many people.\n"

Some may think we’re “old” (39 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots?That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!\n",

      "Message to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:\n",
      "\n",
      "When available, the salary range posted for this position reflects the projected hiring range for new hire, full-time salaries in U.S. and/or Canada locations, not including equity or benefits. For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. or Canada hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.\n",
      "U.S. employees have access to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings. Employees receive up to twelve paid holidays per calendar year, which includes one floating holiday, plus a day off for their birthday. Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.\n",
      "Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:\n",
      ".75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;\n",
      "1.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;\n",
      "1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.\n",
      "For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.\n",
