    "\n",
    "##### First Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "From and [excellent overview site](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) by SW leader Martin Fowler.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Componentization via Services:\n",
    "    - A component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.\n",
    "    - Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way of componentizing their own software is by breaking down into services.\n",
    "        - Libraries are components that are linked into a program and called using in-memory function calls\n",
    "        - While services are out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web service request, or remote procedure call.    \n",
    "    - __Note:__ I do not completely agree.\n",
    "        - The microservice design focuses on the ability to have services run in different processes.\n",
    "        - Program and design to a \"out of process\" model but may deploy together, in-process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organized around Business Capabilities:\n",
    "    - When looking to split a large application into parts, often management focuses on the technology layer, leading to UI teams, server-side logic teams, and database teams. \n",
    "    - When teams are separated along these lines, even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and budgetary approval.\n",
    "    - The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into services organized around business capability. Such services take a broad-stack implementation of software for that business area, including user-interface, persistant storage, and any external collaborations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Products not Projects:\n",
    "    - Most application development efforts that we see use a project model: where the aim is to deliver some piece of software which is then considered to be completed. \n",
    "    - Microservice proponents tend to avoid this model, preferring instead the notion that a team should own a product over its full lifetime.\n",
    "    - The product mentality, ties in with the linkage to business capabilities.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Smart endpoints and dumb pipes:\n",
    "    - When building communication structures between different processes, we've seen many products and approaches that stress putting significant smarts into the communication mechanism itself. (See [Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus).\n",
    "    - Applications built from microservices aim to be as decoupled and as cohesive as possible - they own their own domain logic and act more as filters in the classical Unix sense - receiving a request, applying logic as appropriate and producing a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Governance:\n",
    "    - One of the consequences of centralized governance is the tendency to standardize on single technology platforms. Experience shows that this approach is constricting - not every problem is a nail and not every solution a hammer.\n",
    "    - Polyglot programming, polyglot persistence, just consume the right frameworks for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decentralized Data Management:\n",
    "    - Decentralization of data management presents in a number of different ways. At the most abstract level, it means that the conceptual model of the world will differ between systems. (Microservice own and choose their data model).\n",
    "    - Microservices prefer letting each service manage its own database, either different instances of the same database technology, or entirely different database systems.\n",
    "    - Eventual consistency versus transactional consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infrastructure Automation:\n",
    "    - Use of [Continuous Delivery:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) \"Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.[1] It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.\" \n",
    "    - Tools automate test, promotion, ... on code commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design for failure:\n",
    "    - A consequence of using services as components, is that applications need to be designed so that they can tolerate the failure of services.\n",
    "    - Things fail on the Internet. Get over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evolutionary Design:\n",
    "    - The key property of a component is the notion of independent replacement and upgradeability - which implies we look for points where we can imagine rewriting a component without affecting its collaborators.\n",
    "    - Small, continuous, incremental evolution of components (aligning with [Agile Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)) instead of release cycles.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Second Perspective Event-Centric, Event-First, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional SOA and applications focus on components being aware of and calling other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-centric model is:\n",
    "    - What can happen in the environment?\n",
    "    - Which microservices need to react to the event?\n",
    "    - What events happen because of the action?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Much looser coupling and incremental addition or change of functionality."

    "\n",
    "\"In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database. This isolation supports the single responsibility principle. It separates what data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the public interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc. (the implementation of the DAO).\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object)\n",

    "- \"The term \"software multitenancy\" refers to a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a dedicated share of the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multitenant applications are typically required to provide a high degree of __customization__ to support each target organization's needs. Customization typically includes the following aspects:\n",
    "    - Branding: allowing each organization to customize the look-and-feel of the application to match their corporate branding (often referred to as a distinct \"skin\").\n",
    "    - Workflow: accommodating differences in workflow to be used by a wide range of potential customers.\n",
    "    - Extensions to the data model: supporting an extensible data model to give customers the ability to customize the data elements managed by the application to meet their specific needs.\n",
    "    - Access control: letting each client organization independently customize access rights and restrictions for each user.\n",
