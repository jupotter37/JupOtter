    "1. **Importing Required Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries: `logging` for logging purposes, `webdriver` from the `selenium` library to control the web browser, and various classes and modules from Selenium for interacting with web elements and handling exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Configuring Logging**: The `logging.basicConfig` function is used to configure the logging settings, such as the log level and the format of log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the `extract_text_from_page` Function**: This function takes a `url` as input and returns the text content of the web page at that URL. Here's what happens inside the function:\n",
    "   - A new instance of the Chrome WebDriver is created using `webdriver.Chrome()`.\n",
    "   - The provided `url` is loaded in the browser using `driver.get(url)`.\n",
    "   - The `body` element of the web page is located using `find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'body')`.\n",
    "   - The `send_keys` method is used to simulate the `Ctrl+A` key combination, which selects all text on the page.\n",
    "   - The selected text is retrieved from the `body` element using the `text` attribute and stored in the `selected_text` variable.\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs during the process, an error message is logged using `logger.error`.\n",
    "   - Finally, the `selected_text` is returned, or an empty string is returned if an error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exception Handling and Cleanup**: The `try`...`except`...`finally` block ensures that any exceptions that occur during the text extraction process are caught and handled appropriately. The `finally` block ensures that the WebDriver instance is always closed (`driver.quit()`) after the operation is complete, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Getting User Input**: The code prompts the user to input a job description URL using the `input` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calling the `extract_text_from_page` Function**: The provided URL is passed to the `extract_text_from_page` function, which extracts the text content from the web page and stores it in the `page_text` variable.\n",
