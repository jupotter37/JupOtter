    "In this conversation, I sought clarification on a Python code that simulates the Monty Hall problem to assess the probability of winning by using a door-switching strategy. The code runs 100,000 simulations of the game, where a player picks one of three doors, and a host reveals a \"goat\" behind one of the remaining doors. The player then switches to the other unopened door. The code tracks how many times this switching strategy results in a win. By calculating the proportion of wins, it confirms that the probability of winning increases when the player switches doors, aligning with the optimal strategy of the Monty Hall problem.\n",

In the context of the Monty Hall problem, once certain doors are excluded, there is only one valid door left to reveal. Thus, np.random.choice() was unnecessary, and we could directly select the only available door.\n",

    "The chat bot had no issue explaining the extensions to the code:\n",

The first extension upgrades this to a trigram model, where two consecutive words are used to predict the next word, adding more context for the chatbot's responses. The second extension goes further by making the model character-specific. It assigns different trigram models to different characters in a dataset, allowing the chatbot to generate responses that mimic each character's speaking style. Together, these extensions make the bot more coherent and personalized.\n",

    "The experience working with ChatGPT has been flawless. The bot was able to provide answers to my questions quickly and accurately, without the need for any helps or hints. Nothing about the learning process proved frustrating, as if more clarification was needed, I was able to ask for as much extra help as I wanted. Compared to google, Chat also has the advantage of being able to provide specific examples to aid in the understanding. Overall, to give it a score, I would honestly give it a perfect score, whether that be 10/10 or 5 stars. ChatGPT has been extremely useful during both homework assignments and for general questions."

    "My view of chat bots has improved significantly since the beginning of this course. I have always been fairly adverse to the concept of AI, as it seems too close to a science fiction story that goes badly for humanity. For this reason, this course has been my first time using AI in my life, and I must admit, it has positively surprised me. I still believe there will reach a point that is \"too far\" in terms of expanding the capabilities of AI, however for this application of it being a simple virtual tutor, the experience has been amazing."

    "\n",
    "It was notable that ChatGPT took a long time, and three attempts at the prompt, to respond to the question about the difference between AI and ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of our conversation that you can use for your assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation focused on the importance of key skills—learning and adaptability, communication, coding, and statistics and data analysis—in the modern world, particularly within the data science industry. These skills are crucial for career success because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning and adaptability help professionals stay current with rapidly evolving tools and technologies.\n",
    "- Communication is essential for explaining complex data insights to non-technical stakeholders, which is critical for decision-making.\n",
    "- Coding is fundamental for implementing data-driven solutions and automating processes.\n",
    "    Statistics and data analysis are the core of understanding data and drawing accurate conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed the difference between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI is a broad field aimed at creating systems that mimic human intelligence, including areas like natural language processing and robotics.\n",
    "- ML is a subset of AI, focusing on how machines can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, these skills and concepts are vital in the data science industry and provide a solid foundation for a successful career in technology and data-driven fields.\n",

    "#### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of the conversation with ChatGPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "In financial consulting and financial analysis, a combination of technical, analytical, business, and communication skills is crucial. Key technical skills include financial modeling, advanced Excel proficiency, a strong understanding of accounting and financial statements, and the use of financial software like Bloomberg Terminal. Analytical skills, such as problem-solving, quantitative analysis, and attention to detail, are essential for interpreting data and identifying trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business knowledge, including familiarity with economics, market dynamics, and risk management, helps in making informed decisions. Strong communication and presentation skills are necessary to effectively summarize and present complex financial data to clients and stakeholders. Additionally, certifications such as the CFA or CPA can enhance career prospects, while an MBA can provide an edge in consulting roles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Individual logs are in their respective questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently I am very focused on my potential future career and how I can build up a portfolio, especially now in first year, to reach those goals. I will be studying financial economics and statistics with the intention of getting into the finance industry, however in more data analytical jobs, such as financial consulting. To achieve this, I understand that I need both a strong degree and also relevant experience. Though it is difficult to land an internship in my first year, I have found other things that I can do to improve my resume to hopefully acquire one in my second year. Some of these strategies include attending work shops, conferences/job fairs, participating in clubs, working on personal projects, and potentially getting a work study position. I also think it is important to work on other skills and soft skill along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel that ChatGPT is very useful for most things, however it may lack some wisdom when it comes to topics such as careers and the future. While ChatGPT is intelligent, it is still a collection of the information and opinions avaliable on the internet. For this reason, I feel it may lack the personal experience and wisdom gained throughout one's career, that a real professional may have. In other words, ChatGPT is similar to a very strong google search, however this can only provide the fundamentals of a complex concept like the nature of a person's life or future. To resolve this, I will be looking into any kind of mentorship opportunities or councilling resources that are avaliable to me at the university. A perfect example of this is the 1-on-1 mentorship meetings provided with the STA130 mentorship program."
