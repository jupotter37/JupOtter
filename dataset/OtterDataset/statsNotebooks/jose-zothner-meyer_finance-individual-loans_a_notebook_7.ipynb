    "# Key Findings from the Risk Factor Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. DTI (Debt-to-Income) Ratio\n",
    "- Both Charged Off (4.08) and Late loans (4.05) show higher average DTI ratios compared to Current loans (3.90)\n",
    "- This suggests that borrowers with higher debt relative to their income are more likely to default\n",
    "- The difference is relatively small (~0.15-0.18 points) but consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Interest Rates\n",
    "- Late loans have the highest average interest rate (3.94%)\n",
    "- Charged Off loans actually have the lowest average rate (3.69%) \n",
    "- Current loans fall in the middle (3.85%)\n",
    "- This is an interesting finding as it suggests that interest rate alone may not be the best predictor of default\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### DTI-Based Risk Assessment\n",
    "- Consider implementing stricter DTI thresholds in loan approval processes\n",
    "- Pay extra attention to loans where DTI exceeds 4.0\n",
    "- Consider additional monitoring for borrowers with higher DTI ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interest Rate Considerations  \n",
    "- The relationship between interest rates and default risk appears more complex than expected\n",
    "- Other factors may be more important in predicting default risk\n",
    "- Consider developing a more comprehensive risk assessment model that includes multiple factors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monitoring Strategy\n",
    "- Set up early warning systems for loans where DTI exceeds the average of charged-off loans (4.08)\n",
    "- Look for combinations of risk factors rather than relying on single metrics\n",
    "- Consider implementing more frequent check-ins with borrowers who have higher DTI ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DTI Distribution**:\n",
    "   - The median DTI is consistently higher than the mean across all loan statuses\n",
    "   - Late loans show the highest median DTI (4.35)\n",
    "   - The spread of DTI values is relatively consistent (std dev ~1.0-1.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interest Rate Patterns**:\n",
    "   - Late loans show the highest median and mean interest rates\n",
    "   - Interest rates are more tightly clustered (lower std dev) than DTI ratios\n",
    "   - Charged off loans surprisingly show the lowest interest rates"
