Such students must complete the requirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters. Upon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate student to continue work towards the master of science degree. The requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the Graduate Catalog . Generally, the master's degree requires 30 additional hours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of computer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be applied to the master's degree if the coursework is not also used to satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor's degree. The requirements for the master's can be completed in as few as two additional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study. Students interested in the dual-degree program should have completed (or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the 400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must formally apply for admission to the combined B.S.–M.S. program, and it is expected that the application process would take place in the student's sixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will be notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth semester. Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study.\n",

Applying to the dual-degree program occurs in two steps. First, the student must apply to the B.S.I.S. program with intent to pursue the dual degree. The student must apply to the master's program in the sixth, seventh, or eighth semester of undergraduate study. For admission to study at the master's level in the fall semester, students should meet the application deadline in the prior spring, and for admission in the spring semester, the prior fall. In other words, students must apply in time to be continually enrolled, with no \"gap\" semester. The curriculum for the dual degree can be found on the SILS website (http://sils.unc.edu/programs/ bs-ms/curriculum/). Up to 12 credit hours of information science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be applied to the master's degree if the coursework is not also used to satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor's degree. The requirements for the master's degree can be found in the Graduate Catalog . Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised to consult the director of undergraduate studies or the undergraduate student services coordinator at SILS in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an appropriate plan of study.\n",

      "Information Science Major, B.S. (BSIS) - Special Opportunities in SILS - Honors in Information Science: An honors program is available to information science majors who have demonstrated the ability to perform distinguished work. The honors thesis allows exceptional students in the undergraduate major to demonstrate the ability to treat a problem in a substantial and scholarly way. Students write an honors thesis on a topic related to information science and defend it before a faculty committee. They may graduate with honors or highest honors. The honors program consists of two courses: INLS 691H and INLS 692H.   INLS 691H will be taken in the fall of the senior year. In this course, each student selects a research topic of interest, learns about research methods, and writes a research proposal. Assuming satisfactory completion of INLS 691H, students register for INLS 692H in the spring of their senior year. The student and advisor meet regularly to discuss the student's research and writing. The second reader for the thesis, identified jointly by the student and advisor, is chosen by the end of January. The director of the SILS honors program is the third reader. Refer to Honors Carolina for official due dates. The final approved thesis must be submitted electronically via  the Carolina Digital Repository (CDR). Students may apply for the honors program in the spring of their junior year. The requirements for conducting an honors thesis in information science include having taken at least four INLS courses, including two numbered above 299, and having a total INLS grade point average of at least 3.5. The student should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.3. Enrolling in INLS 692H is contingent on completing INLS 691H with a grade of A- or higher.

      "Nursing Major, B.S.N. (NURS) - Critical Information for ALL Nursing Students - Computer Requirements: All School of Nursing students are required to use e-mail for conveying course/clinical/research/other school-related business. All e-mail communication regarding School of Nursing matters must utilize the student's University e-mail address only. The use of external e-mail services is not permitted. School of Nursing courses use the Sakai learning management system, which requires frequent reliable access to Internet resources. For both these reasons, easy access to personal computers and the Web are imperative. The School of Nursing provides a PC laboratory solely for the use of undergraduate students, and students may also access PC laboratory facilities elsewhere on campus. All B.S.N. and A.B.S.N. option students are required to have a laptop computer that meets the minimum requirements specified for the preloaded laptop computers available through the University's Carolina Computing Initiative (CCI) program (http://cci.unc.edu/new-students/ minimum-laptop-requirement/). Choosing a vendor for the laptop purchase is the student's prerogative; however, it is important to note that the University provides \"software and operating system support for non-CCI laptops on a best-effort basis. Hardware support for non-CCI laptops is the responsibility of the owner\" (source: CCI.unc.edu (http:// CCI.unc.edu)). In addition to the computer itself, students must have an internet service provider (ISP) and an account for a high-speed access service. Of note: the School of Nursing uses ExamSoft for testing. Students are required to purchase this program and ensure computer compatibility with the program.\n",
