    "The MU behavior has several nonlinear properties, including the relation between the MU isometric force and the stimulus frequency ([Milner-brown et al. 1973](https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1973.sp010087 \"The contractile properties of human motor units during voluntary isometric contractions\")). The so-called force-frequency relationship has a sigmoidal shape, so that the force of the MU saturates at high-frequency stimulation. Typically, the stimulus rate for MU force saturation is higher than 50 imp/s for muscles that control the digits of the hand ([Fuglevand et al 1999](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1999.81.4.1718 \"Force-Frequency and Fatigue Properties of Motor Units in Muscles That Control Digits of the Human Hand\")). Also, the shape of the force-frequency relationship depends on the contractile properties of the MU. Fast-contracting MUs tend to fuse faster when compared with slowly-contracting MUs. It is also important to note that the stimulus rate for MU force saturation is much higher than the firing rate produced by the MU during a maximum voluntary contraction (mean rate of ~35 imp/s for the first dorsal interosseous muscle, [Enoka and Fuglevand 2001](https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1002/1097-4598(200101)24:1<4::AID-MUS13>3.0.CO;2-F \"Motor unit physiology: Some unresolved issues:\")).\n",
