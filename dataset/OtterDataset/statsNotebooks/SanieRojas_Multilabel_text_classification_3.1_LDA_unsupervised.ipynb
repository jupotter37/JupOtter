    "## Unsupervised classification method : Latent Dirichlet allocation or LDA \n",
    "\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model commonly used for topic modeling and unsupervised classification in the context of text data. In LDA, each document is viewed as a mixture of topics, and each topic is considered a distribution of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm aims to uncover these latent topics by iteratively assigning words to topics based on the probability of word-topic associations. For text classification, LDA can be applied to identify underlying themes or topics within a collection of documents. By assigning topics to documents and words to topics, LDA provides a structured representation of the textual content, enabling the discovery of hidden patterns and relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method is valuable for organizing large datasets of unstructured text, facilitating content summarization, and enhancing the interpretability of document collections. In the context of unsupervised classification, LDA offers a powerful approach to discovering the inherent structure and content themes within text corpora, aiding in tasks such as categorizing companies by industry based on the content of their websites."

    "We will use embeddings to calculate similarities among companies and to classify them based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. The SIC classification is a standardized numerical code assigned to businesses and industries to facilitate uniformity in economic reporting and analysis. Developed by the U.S. government, the SIC system categorizes companies into specific industry groups based on their primary economic activities. Each SIC code consists of a unique four-digit number, with greater specificity achieved through additional digits. We will kickstart this project by only using the first level of classification. See more information on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Industrial_Classification#:~:text=The%20Standard%20Industrial%20Classification%20\n",

This classification methodology allows for a more granular understanding of industry affiliations and can enhance the precision of clustering and categorization efforts within the broader context of data science and natural language processing applications."
