    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a specific value takes place. It provides the probability of each possible outcome as a discrete probability distribution.\n",
    "Example of PMF:\n",
    "Consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this scenario would give us the probability of getting each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) after rolling the die. Since each outcome is equally likely, the PMF for this situation would be: PMF(x) = 1/6 for x ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and PMF(x) = 0 for other values of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The Probability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables and provides the likelihood of a random variable falling within a specific range. Unlike PMF, the PDF doesn't directly give the probability at specific points due to the continuous nature of the variable.\n",
    "### Example of PDF:\n",
    "A common example is the standard normal distribution (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1). The PDF of the standard normal distribution is the bell-shaped curve, also known as the Gaussian curve. It provides the probability density for different values within the range of the distribution. The PDF can be denoted as f(x), and its specific formula is: f(x) = (1 / √(2π)) * e^((-x^2) / 2), where 'e' is the base of the natural logarithm."

    "- The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that provides the cumulative probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given point. For discrete random variables, the CDF is the sum of the probabilities up to that point, and for continuous random variables, it is the integral of the probability density function up to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of CDF:\n",
    "Let's consider a fair six-sided die again. The CDF at a specific point 'x' will give us the probability of rolling a value less than or equal to 'x'. For example, the CDF at x = 3 would be 1/2, as there is a 50% chance of rolling a number less than or equal to 3 on the die.\n",

    "The CDF is essential because it gives us information about the probabilities of outcomes for a random variable across a range of values.
