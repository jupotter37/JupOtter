    "A Markov Chain is a mathematical model that transitions between states based on current state probabilities, not the history of events.\n",

    "Text Generation Using Markov Chains:\n",

    "Overview: Discussed Markov Chains, their use in text generation, and the basics of how they work. Explained how Markov Chains transition between states based on current state probabilities.\n",
    "Applications: Mentioned applications like text generation, predictive text, and music generation.\n",
    "Code Extensions: Provided Python code examples for basic Markov Chain text generation, and extended the code with features like variable-length contexts (n-grams) and weighted probabilities.\n",
    "Summarization of Session 1 (Session 2):\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary: Provided a summary of the session on Markov Chains, highlighting key points such as the concept of Markov Chains, their application in text generation, and example code provided.\n",
    "Additional Code Extensions (Session 3):\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensions: Added two extensions to the Markov Chain text generation code:\n",
    "Variable-Length Contexts: Introduced the ability to work with n-grams of varying lengths, making the text generation process more flexible.\n",
    "Weighted Probabilities: Used weighted probabilities based on frequency to make text generation more realistic and reflective of the input corpus.\n",
