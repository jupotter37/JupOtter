The height of the mountains in the **Sierra Nevada** increases gradually from north to south and the height of the peaks in the red block region vary between 5,000 feet (1,500 m) to 9,000 feet.

This can be done by considering the precipitation readings over a month as the average of the days in it. The **shape and hence the pattern of precipitation** across various years in similar to US-Climate-Data, hence it rains at similar intances across a year according to both sources. The diffrence in readings of the US-Climate-Data is captured by the **mean+std-curve** of our data. This variation is because our data contains the average across various stations around Truckee and few of them fall in the **RAIN SHADOW REGION** of Sierra Nevada. Therefore, these stations receive lesser rainfall causing the precipitation average to be lesser than Truckee alone.&nbsp;</p>\n",
