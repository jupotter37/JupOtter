    "## Question 7: Stereotype Threat\n",
    "\n",
    "Stereotype threat is a sociological concept which refers to the predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of conforming to stereotypes about their social group. The existence of negative stereotypes about one's group has been found to play a detrimental role in one's academic performance, regardless of that individual's own intelligence or if they were directly confronted with those stereotypes. This is a significant contributor to the \"scholastic achievement gap\" for ethnic minorities and women, even though these groups have been shown to just as capable, if not more capable, than groups that do not have negative stereotypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990s, researchers at Stanford University studied the effects of stereotype threat on the test performance of African Americans. In one of their experiments, they had 114 undergraduate students from Stanford complete questions from the verbal portion of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). Before they took the exam, the examiner, a white man, told students in one group that the study was concerned with \"various personal factors involved in performance on problems requiring reading and verbal reasoning abilities [and that it was] a genuine test of your verbal abilities and limitations so that we may better understand the factors involved in both.\" We will call this group, Group A. The other group, Group B, was not told this statement. The students â€“ Black and white, and male and female â€“ were randomly assigned to each group and each group had representatives from each demographic group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon analysis of the test results, the researchers found that Black students in Group A were able to solve 8 questions on average. White students in Group A were able to solve 12 questions on average. In Group B, both Black and White students solved 12 questions on average. Under their null hypothesis, that Black and White students would solve the same number of questions on average, they found that their observed result only occurred less than 1% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers write: \"Black participants performed worse than white participants when the test was presented as a measure of their ability, but improved dramatically, matching the performance of whites, when the test was presented as less reflective of ability.\" "
