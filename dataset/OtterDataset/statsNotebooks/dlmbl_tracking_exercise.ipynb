    "- Write a pipeline that takes in cell detections and links them across time to obtain lineage trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods/Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`networkx`**: To represent the tracking inputs and outputs as graphs. Tracking is often framed\n",
    "    as a graph optimization problem. Nodes in the graph represent detections, and edges represent links\n",
    "    across time. The \"tracking\" task is then framed as selecting the correct edges to link your detections.\n",
    "- **`motile`**: To set up and solve an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for tracking.\n",
    "    ILP-based methods frame tracking as a constrained optimization problem. The task is to select a subset of nodes/edges from a \"candidate graph\" of all possible nodes/edges. The subset must minimize user-defined costs (e.g. edge distance), while also satisfying a set of tracking constraints (e.g. each cell is linked to at most one cell in the previous frame). Note: this tracking approach is not inherently using\n",
    "    \"deep learning\" - the costs and constraints are usually hand-crafted to encode biological and data-based priors, although cost features can also be learned from data.\n",
    "- **`napari`**: To visualize tracking inputs and outputs. Qualitative analysis is crucial for tuning the\n",
    "    weights of the objective function and identifying data-specific costs and constraints.\n",
    "- **`traccuracy`**: To evaluate tracking results. Metrics such as accuracy can be misleading for tracking,\n",
    "    because rare events such as divisions are much harder than the common linking tasks, and might\n",
    "    be more biologically relevant for downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important to evaluate on\n",
    "    a wide range of error metrics and determine which are most important for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running through the full tracking pipeline, from loading to evaluation, we will learn how to **incorporate custom costs** based on dataset-specific prior information. As a bonus exercise,\n",
    "you can learn how to **learn the best cost weights** for a task from\n",

You will want a positive weight, since higher distances should be more costly, unlike in the example when higher scores were good and so we inverted them with a negative weight.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Because distance is always positive, and you want a positive weight, you will want to include a negative constant on the <code>EdgeDistance</code> cost. If there are no negative selection costs, the ILP will always select nothing, because the cost of selecting nothing is zero.</li>\n",
    "    <li>We want to allow divisions. So, we should pass in 2 to our <code>MaxChildren</code> constraint. The <code>MaxParents</code> constraint should have 1, the same as the quickstart, because neither task allows merging.</li>\n",

It compares your solution graph to the ground truth graph and measures how many changes to edges and nodes would need to be made in order to make the graphs identical. TRA ranges between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match between the solution and the ground truth. While TRAf is convenient to use in that it gives us a single number, it doesn't tell us what type of mistakes are being made in our solution.\n",
    "- **Node Errors**: We can look at the number of false positive and false negative nodes in our solution which tells us how how many cells are being incorrectly included or excluded from the solution.\n",
    "- **Edge Errors**: Similarly, the number of false positive and false negative edges in our graph helps us assess what types of mistakes our solution is making when linking cells between frames.\n",
    "- **Division Errors**: Finally, as biologists we are often very interested in the division events that occur and want to ensure that they are being accurately identified.
