    "Omid Riazi, one of the Physics graduates of K. N. Toosi University of Technology opened a mobile phone shop after he realized that he could not earn money from Physics ðŸ˜”. On the first day the shop opens, there are no mobile phones in the shop. Then, every hour, a customer visits the shop. If up to this moment, up to ``i`` mobiles are available in the shop, the new customer will buy a mobile from the shop with probability ``L[i]``, and sell a mobile to the shopkeeper with probability ``1-L[i]``.\n",
    "\n",
    "But buying and selling mobile phones to the shop has conditions. If a customer wants to buy a mobile phone but there is no mobile phone in the store, the customer leaves the store without paying or buying a mobile phone. Also, the shop has a capacity and cannot hold more than ``n`` mobile phones. So if there are ``n`` mobile phones in the shop and the customer wants to sell his mobile phone, the shopkeeper will not accept the mobile phone and the customer will leave the shop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shopkeeper, who has not remembered anything about statistics and probability after years, asks for your help to solve this question. He wants to know, after ``m`` hours, what is the expectation value of the number of mobile phones in the shop?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this exercise, you must implement the ``solve`` function."
