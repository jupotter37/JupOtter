    "We could see that there is a hugh hub with more than 1000 degree in in-degree of scale free network, which is way more larger than something around 400 compared with real network of comics characters. However, the number of hubs with more than 100 in-degrees are quite low compared with real network. This fact indicates that in comics network, the amount of main character is not that small (there are 39 hubs with more than 100 in-degrees), the stories are told not only around just 4-5 characters, but in scale free network, the number of hubs will be less while one of which contains an overwhelmly number of in-degrees.**"
