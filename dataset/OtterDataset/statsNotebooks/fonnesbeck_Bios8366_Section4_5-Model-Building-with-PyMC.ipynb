    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference begins with specification of a probability model relating unknown variables to data. PyMC provides the basic building blocks for Bayesian probability models: stochastic random variables, deterministic variables, and factor potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **stochastic random variable** is a factor whose value is not completely determined by its parents, while the value of a **deterministic random variable** is entirely determined by its parents. Most models can be constructed using only these two variable types. The third quantity, the **factor potential**, is *not* a variable but simply a\n",

    "## The Distribution class\n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic variable is represented in PyMC by a `Distribution` class. This structure adds functionality to Aesara's `aesara.tensor.random.op.RandomVariable` class, mainly by registering it with an associated PyMC `Model`. As we demonstrated in a previous section, `Distribution` objects are only usable inside of a `Model` context.\n",

    ":   Numeric or symbolic untransformed initial value of matching shape, or one of the following initial value strategies: \"moment\", \"prior\". Depending on the sampler's settings, a random jitter may be added to numeric, symbolic or moment-based initial values in the transformed space.\n",

    "`model`\n",
    ":   The PyMC model to which the variable belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we previewed in the introduction, `Distribution` has a classmethod `dist` that returns a **stateless** probability distribution of that type; that is, without being wrapped in a PyMC random variable object. Sometimes we wish to use a particular statistical distribution, without using it as a variable in a model; for example, to generate random numbers from the distribution. "
