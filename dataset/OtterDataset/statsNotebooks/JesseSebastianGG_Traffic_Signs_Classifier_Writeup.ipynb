    "\n",
    "Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a collection of histograms showing the distribution of the labels in the three data sets. Clearly some labels are more well represented than others; I compensate for this with data augmentation (see below).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "I experimented with lots of pre-processing with the aim of reducing the computational budget without overly impacting accuracy. Converting to grayscale achieved this (which is intuitive - humans can recognise signs just as well in grayscale); as did histogram-equalization and normalisation. Normalisation has the effect of conifying the loss landscape, thereby equalizing weights of each feature in the the learning process and reducing the length of journeys from random starting points to points near an apex, and so speeding up gradient descent-type learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding noise (see image) appeared to cause under-fitting so I abandoned it; of course it may be that by spending more time tweeking parameters here the model could be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what images look like after undergoing the following processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the unbalanced data-set, I generated new data until all classes had at least 2000 instances. I generated new data by performing a series of 100 random affine transformations on enough relevant instances. This shows the kind of transformations used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a balanced data set was produced for learning, I applied only three pre-processing steps to all data sets (including validation and testing, of coure): conversion to grayscale, histogram-equalization and normalization. The normalization I used was an approximation; the image set (considered 32 by 32 arrays of pixels) was centred around zero (by subtracting the mean) then rescaled so the standard deviation was closer to 1 by dividing by the mean. A stricter normalization would divide by the standard deviation. This process took a very long time (10 mins) in spite of vectorization in numpy.\n",

Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "* Models that were too large underfitted\n",
    "* Most models over-fitted; though data-balancing helped, it was notably those classes under-represented in the original data set that were the most difficult to recognize. Note how drop in accuracy of the model on valid and test sets in the 20s and 30s, corresponding to the classes with fewer instances provided. This suggests that my generation techniques didn't fully capture variation in the underlying set. Ideally an analysis would be performed of the variations, which would then be applied to the underpresented classes, in order to predict valid and test test properties (intrinsic features and contingent variation).\n",

Looking at the first two photos, the sign takes up so little of the pictures that when rescaled to 32 by 32 it is impossible even for a human to recognise, giving a much lower Bayesian error (show the second image to someone who hasn't seen the original and they will probably have no idea what it is).
