    "In subchapter 5b we covered a very useful methodology for modeling quantitative or continuous outcomes.  We of course know though that health outcomes come in all different types of data types.  In fact, the health outcomes we often care about most -- cured/not cured, alive/dead, are discrete binary outcomes.  It would be ideal if we could extend the same general framework for continuous outcomes to these binary outcomes.  Logistic regression allows us to incorporate much of what we learned in the previous subchapter and apply the same principles to binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with binary data, we would like to be able to model the probability of a type of outcome given one or more covariates.  One might ask, why not just simply use linear regression?  There are several reasons why this is generally a bad idea.  Probabilities need to be somewhere between zero and one, and there is nothing in linear regression to constrain the estimated probabilities to this interval.  This would mean that you could have an estimated probability 2, or even a negative probability!  This is one unattractive property of such a method (there are others), and although it is sometimes used, the availability of good software such as `R` allows us to perform better analyses easily and efficiently.  Before introducing such software, we should introduce the analysis of small contingency tables.\n",

We could of course create categories from the covariate by establishing cut points, but we may still miss some important aspect of the relationship between the covariate and the outcome by not choosing the right cut points. Also, what happens when we know that a nuisance covariate is related to both the outcome and the covariate of interest.  This type of nuisance variable is called a confounder and occurs frequently in observational data, and although there are ways of accounting for confounding in contingency tables, they become more difficult to use when there are more than one present.\n",

If you recall, using linear regression is problematic because it is prone to estimating probabilities outside of the [0,1] range.  Logistic regression has no such problem per se, because it uses a link function known as the logit function which maps probabilities in the interval $[0,1]$ to a real number $(-\\infty,\\infty)$.

If you recall the properties of logarithms, that the difference of two logs is the log of their ratio, so  $log(Odds_{x=1}) - log(Odds_{x=0}) =  log(Odds_{x=1}/Odds_{x=0})$, which may be looking familiar.  This is the log ratio of the odds or the *log odds ratio* in the $x=1$ group relative to the $x=0$ group.

The `glm`  function works in much the same way the `lm` function does.  We need to specify a formula of the form: `outcome ~ covariates`, specify what dataset to use (in our case the `dat` data frame), and then specify the family.  For logistic regression `family='binomial'` will be our choice.  You can run the `summary` function, just like you did for `lm` and it produces output very similar to what `lm` did.\n",

If you recall, the non-intercept coefficients are log-odds ratios, so testing if they are zero is equivalent to testing if the odds ratios are one.

The coefficient for `age.cat` is the log odds ratio for the 2x2 table we previously did the analysis on.  When we exponentiate `r round(age.glm$coef[2],2)`, we get `exp(` `r round(age.glm$coef[2],2)` `)` = `r round(exp(age.glm$coef[2]),2)`.  This corresponds with the estimate using the 2x2 table.  For completeness, let's look at the other coefficient, the intercept.  If you recall, $log(Odds_{x=0}) = \\beta_0$, so $\\beta_0$ is the log odds of the outcome in the younger group.  Exponentiating again, `exp(` `r round(age.glm$coef[1],2)` `)` = `r round(exp(age.glm$coef[1]),3)`, and this corresponds with the previous analysis we did.  Similarly, $log(Odds_{x=1}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1$, and the estimated odds of 28 day death in the older group is `exp(` `r round(age.glm$coef[1],2)` ` + ` `r round(age.glm$coef[2],2)` `)` = `r round(exp(sum(age.glm$coef[1:2])),2)`, as was found above.

Logistic regression allows us to extend the basic idea to at least two very relevant areas.  The first is the case where we have more than one covariate of interest.  Perhaps we have a confounder, we are concerned about, and want to adjust for it.  Alternatively, maybe there are two covariates of interest.  Secondly, it allows use to use covariates as continuous quantities, instead of discretizing them into categories.  For example, instead of dividing age up into exhaustive strata (as we did very simply by just dividing the patients into two groups, $\\le55$ and $>55$ ), we could instead use age as a continuous covariate.\n",

Taking the exponential of these will result in an odds ratio for each variable, adjusted for the other variables in the model.  In this case the adjusted odds ratios for Age>55, MICU and SICU are `r round(exp(ageunit.glm$coef[2]),2) `, `r round(exp(ageunit.glm$coef[3]),2) `, and `r round(exp(ageunit.glm$coef[4]),2) `, respectively.  We would conclude that there is an almost 9-fold increase in the odds of 28 day mortality for those in the $>55$ year age group relative to the younger $\\le55$ group while holding service unit constant.  This adjustment becomes important in many scenarios where groups of patients may be more or less likely to receive treatment, but also more or less likely to have better outcomes, where one effect is confounded by possibly many others.

What if the age difference of interest is ten years instead of one year?  There are at least two ways of doing this.  One is to replace `age` with `I(age/10)`, which uses a new covariate which is `age` divided by ten.  The second is to use the `agects.glm` estimated log odds ratio, and multiple by ten prior to exponentiating.  They will yield equivalent estimates of `r round(exp(agects.glm$coef[2]*10),2)`, but it is now per 10 year increases in age.  This is useful when the estimated odds ratios (or log odds ratios) are close to one (or zero).

Assessing the linearity of the log odds of the outcome and some discretized form of the covariate can be done graphically.  For instance, we can break age into 5 groups, and estimate the log odds of 28 day mortality in each group.  Plotting these quantities in Figure 1, we can see in this particular case, age is indeed strongly related to the odds of the outcome.  Further, expressing age linearly appears like it would be a good approximation.  If on the other hand, 28 day mortality has more of a \"U\"-shaped curve, we may falsely conclude that no relationship between age and mortality exists, when the relationship may be rather strong.  Such may be the case when looking at the the log odds of mortality by the first temperature (`temp_1st`) in Figure 1 (right).\n",

    "\n",
    "Just as in the case for linear regression, there is a way to test hypotheses for logistic regression.  It follows much of the same framework, with the null hypothesis being $\\beta=0$.  If you recall, this is the log odds ratio, and testing if it is zero is equivalent to a test for the odds ratio being equal to one.  Particularly when dealing with a single categorical covariate, there are techniques taught in introductory statistics courses which can be applied here (see `?fisher.test` and `?chisq.test`).  In this chapter, we focus on how to conduct such a test in `R`.\n",

    "As was the case when using `lm`, we first fit the two competing models, a larger (alternative model), and a smaller (null model).  Provided that the models are nested, we can again use the `anova` function, passing the smaller model, then the larger model.  Here our larger model is the one which contained `service_unit` and `age.cat`, and the smaller only contains `age.cat`, so they are nested.  We are then testing if the log odds ratios for the two coefficients associated with `service_unit` are zero.  Let's call these coefficients $\\beta_{MICU}$ and $\\beta_{SICU}$.  To test if $\\beta_{MICU}$ and $\\beta_{SICU} = 0$, we can use the `anova` function, where this time we will specify the type of test, in this case set the `test` parameter to `\"Chisq\"`.\n",

    "Here the output of the `anova` function when applied to `glm` objects looks similar to the output generated when used on `lm` objects.  A couple good practices to get in a habit are to first make sure the two competing models are correctly specified.  He we are are testing `~ age.cat` versus `age.cat + service_unit`.  Next, the difference between the residual degrees of freedom (`Resid. Df`) in the two models tell us how many more parameters the larger model has when compared to the smaller model.  Here we see `1774 - 1772 = 2` which means that there are two more coefficients estimated in the larger model than the smaller one, which corresponds with the output from the `summary` table above.  Next looking at the p-value (`Pr(>Chi)`), we see a test for $\\beta_{MICU}$ and $\\beta_{SICU} = 0$ has a p-value of around 0.08.  At the typical 0.05 significance level, we would not reject the null, and use the simpler model without the service unit.  In logistic regression, this is a common way of testing whether a categorical covariate should be retained in the model, as it can be difficult to assess using the `z value` in the `summary` table, particularly when one is very statistically significant, and one is not.\n",

Such a task may occur when doing a propensity score analysis (Chapter 3.9) or creating tools for clinical decision support.  In the logistic regression setting this involves attempting to estimating the probability of the outcome given the characteristics (covariates) of a patient.  This quantity is often denoted $P(outcome | X)$.  This is relatively easy to accomplish in `R` using the `predict` function.  One must pass a dataset with all the variables contained in the model.  Let's assume that we decided to include the `service_unit` in our final model, and want to generate predictions from this based on a new set of patients.  Let's first create a new data frame called `newdat` using the `expand.grid` function which computes all combinations of the values of variables passed to it.\n",

The `predict` function for logistic regression works similar to when we used it for linear regression, but this time we also specify `type=\"response\"` which ensures the quantities computed are what we need, $P(outcome | X)$.  Outputting this new object shows our predicted probability of 28 day mortality for six hypothetical patients.  Two in each of the service units, where one is in the younger group and another in the older group.  We see that our lowest prediction is for the youngest patients in the FICU, while the patients with highest risk of 28 day mortality are the older group in the MICU, but the predicted probability is not all that much higher than the same age patients in the SICU.\n",

    "# Presenting and Interpreting Logistic Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, presenting the results from a logistic regression model will follow quite closely to what was done in the linear regression setting.  Results should always be put in context, including what variables were considered and which variables were in the final model.  Reporting the results should always include some form of the coefficient estimate, a measure of uncertainty and likely a p-value.  In medical and epidemiological journals, coefficients are usually exponentiated so that they are no longer on the log scale, and reported as odds ratios.  Frequently, multivariable analyses (analysis with more than one covariate) is distinguished from univariate analyses (one covariate) by denoting the estimated odds ratios as adjusted odds ratios (AOR).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `age.glm` model, an example of what could be reported is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Mortality at 28 days was much higher in the older ($>55$ years) group than the younger group ($\\le55$ years), with rates of 28.5% and 4.3%, respectively (OR=8.79, 95% CI: 6.27-12.64, p<0.001).\n",
    "\n",
    "For when treating age as a continuous covariate in the `agects.glm` model we could report:\n",

    "# Caveats and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "As was the case with linear regression, logistic regression is an extremely powerful tool for data analysis of health data.  Although the study outcomes in each approach are different, the framework and way of thinking of the problem have similarities.  Likewise, many of the problems encountered in linear regression are also of concern in logistic regression.  Outliers, missing data, colinearity and dependent/correlated outcomes are all problems for logistic regression as well, and can be dealt with in a similar fashion.  Modelling assumptions are as well, and we briefly touched on this when discussing whether it was appropriate to use age as a continuous covariate in our models.  Although continuous covariates are frequently modeled in this way, it is important to ensure if the relationship between the log odds of the outcome is indeed linear with the covariate.  In cases where the data has been divided into too many subgroups (or the study may be simply too small), you may encounter a level of a discrete variable where none (or very few) of one of the outcomes occurred.  For example, if we had an additional `service_unit` with 50 patients, all of whom lived.  In such a case, the estimated odds ratios and subsequent confidence intervals or hypothesis testing may not be appropriate to use.  In such a case, collapsing the discrete covariate into fewer categories will often help return the analysis into a manageable form.  For our hypothetical new service unit, creating a new group of it and FICU would be a possible solution.  Sometimes a covariate is so strongly related to the outcome, and this is no longer possible, and the only solution may be to report this finding, and remove these patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, logistic regression is a very valuable tool in modelling binary and categorical data.  Although we did not cover this latter case, a similar framework is available for discrete data which is ordered or has more than one category (see `?multinom` in the `nnet` package in `R` for details about multinomial logistic regression).  This and other topics such as assessing model fit, and using logistic regression in more complicated study designs are discussed in [@hosmer2004applied].\n",
