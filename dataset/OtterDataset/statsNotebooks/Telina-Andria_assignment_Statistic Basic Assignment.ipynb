    "Statistics is a mathematical field that uses data to retrieve summary information in order to make better decisions. It is a crucial tool in many fields, such as business, healthcare, and social sciences. By analyzing data, statisticians can identify patterns and relationships that can help inform decision-making. They can also use statistical models to make predictions and test hypotheses. \n",

    "The levels of measurement are a classification for data that describes the amount of information that is contained in the data. There are four levels of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "_Nominal: The nominal level of measurement is the least precise level of measurement. Data at the nominal level can only be categorized. For example, a variable that records a person's gender would be at the nominal level of measurement, because the values (male, female) only represent categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Ordinal: The ordinal level of measurement is more precise than the nominal level, because it allows us to rank the data. For example, a variable that records a person's level of education (high school graduate, college graduate, graduate degree) would be at the ordinal level of measurement, because the values can be ranked in terms of order (high school graduate < college graduate < graduate degree).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Interval: The interval level of measurement is even more precise than the ordinal level, because it allows us to calculate the difference between two values. For example, a variable that records a person's temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) would be at the interval level of measurement, because we can calculate the difference between two temperatures (e.g., 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit - 97.0 degrees Fahrenheit = 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit). However, we cannot say that 1 degree Fahrenheit is twice as hot as 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit, because the interval scale does not have a true zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Ratio: The ratio level of measurement is the most precise level of measurement. It is similar to the interval level of measurement, but it has a true zero point. For example, a variable that records a person's height in inches would be at the ratio level of measurement, because we can calculate the difference between two heights (e.g., 6 feet - 5 feet = 1 foot) and we can say that 6 feet is twice as tall as 3 feet."
