    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is the workhorse of statistics due to its versatility in modeling many real-world phenomena. Here are some examples:\n",

    "Height: Human heights in a population tend to follow a normal distribution. Most people fall around the average height, with fewer individuals being very short or very tall.\n",

    "Test Scores: Scores on standardized tests like SAT or ACT often follow a normal distribution. The mean represents the average score, and the standard deviation reflects the spread of scores around the mean.\n",

    "Scaling the Standard Deviation (σ): A larger standard deviation stretches the curve horizontally, making it wider and flatter. Conversely, a smaller standard deviation squeezes the curve, making it narrower and more peaked.\n",

    "Imagine two normal distributions representing test scores for two different difficulty levels. The easier test might have a higher mean (μ) due to higher average scores.

    "The Bernoulli distribution is a fundamental concept in probability that describes the outcome of a single trial with exactly two possible outcomes: success and failure. It's often referred to as a Bernoulli trial.\n",

    "Binary Outcomes: The experiment or event has only two mutually exclusive outcomes, typically denoted as success (S) and failure (F). There are no other possibilities.\n",

    "Normal Distribution Analysis: When a dataset is assumed to follow a normal distribution (bell-shaped curve), z-scores become particularly insightful. The z-score of a data point directly corresponds to its percentile within the distribution.

    "Random Sampling: Each sample must be drawn randomly and independently from the population. This ensures that every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection of one sample doesn't influence the selection of others.\n",

    "Sample Size (n): The CLT's accuracy strengthens as the sample size (n) increases. There's no universally accepted minimum sample size, but a common rule of thumb suggests n ≥ 30 for the theorem to be reliable. The specific requirement can vary depending on the population's distribution. For highly non-normal populations, a larger sample size might be necessary.\n",

    "Finite Population (Optional):  While the CLT is often applied to infinite populations, it can also be applied to finite populations under certain conditions.  In such cases, the sampling should be done with replacement. This means that a chosen element is returned to the population after being sampled, ensuring all elements have an equal chance of being selected even in subsequent draws from a shrinking pool.  However, the impact of a finite population on the CLT becomes negligible as the population size grows much larger than the sample size.\n"
