    "The Pima Indians, also known as the Akimel O’odham, are a Native American tribe predominantly residing in the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona, USA. This community has received attention in the realm of public health due to a high prevalence of diabetes, both Type-I and Type-II, among its members. Researchers have long been intrigued by the unusually high rates of diabetes within this population, leading to extensive studies aimed at understanding the factors contributing to this health issue. (Schulz & Chaudhari, 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key factors under investigation is the impact of the number of pregnancies on the likelihood of adult women, specifically those aged 21 and above, developing diabetes. Previous research studies, including the one by Akshay Dattatray Khare, have suggested a potential link between the number of pregnancies a woman experiences and her susceptibility to diabetes (Khare, 2022). Pregnancy induces significant hormone changes in a woman’s body, which can influence insulin sensitivity. For Pima Indian women, exploring this relationship is of particular interest due to the higher prevalence of diabetes in their community. \n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this relationship, researchers often rely on comprehensive datasets that include information on the number of pregnancies, diabetes status, genetic factors, lifestyle choices and other relevant variables. Analyzing such data sets, like the one available on Kaggle, provides a valuable opportunity to explore the correlation between the number of pregnancies and the likelihood of diabetes in Pima Indian women.(Khare, 2022) By conducting a rigorous analysis of this data, researchers aim to contribute meaningful insights to the field of public health, potentially paving the way for more effective diabetes prevention tailored specifically to these Pima Indian women.

    "\n",
    "Our ideal dataset should contains about total of 9 variables: the number of Pregnancies, the Glucose level in blood, Blood Pressure measurement, Skin Thickness, Insulin level in blood, BMI, Diabetes Percentage, Age, Outcome of getting Diabetes(Yes=1, No=0). Overall, we should have 1 response variable and 8 explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, a sample size of 30 would be considered as a fairly common choice. Since we are doing Big Data Analysis, a sample size of 30 in our project is not a good choice. By researching, we noticed that the population of Pima Indian heritage is about 7386 as of 2022. Thus, we want to have at least 750 observations in our dataset, which is approximately 10% of the overall population.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned above, our research topic is focusing on the population of Pima Indian heritage. Our research question focuses on adult women who are at least 21 years old. Thus, we want to collect data from the population of Pima Indian heritage whose age is above 20 years old, either have the pregnancy experience or not, with all their data that corresponds to our variables. Hence, we will search online(such as: kaggle) for our dataset. Those data would be collected and stored in a “.csv” file so that our software environment can easily load it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Search for potential **real** datasets that could provide you with something useful for this project.  You do not have to find every piece of data you will use, but you do need to have demonstrated some idea that (a) this data is gettable and (b) that this data may be different from what your ideal is\n",

    "- (a) Our data is from Kaggle's “Diabetes Dataset”, which is “originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Thus, our dataset is real. Inside this page, it provides a click button where we can download and use the dataset. Moreover, the dataset that it provided is in the “.csv” format with a total of 768 observations, which also met our expectations.\n",
    "- (b) 1. Our ideal dataset is the most updated dataset, which contains the most updated situation of how the number of pregnancies influences the outcome of diabetes. However, our dataset was first created in 2015. So we don't know how many times it has been updated and whether the current version is the most recent one. 2. This dataset didn't specify which type it was focusing on. So in our project, we assumed it included both Type-I and Type-II.\n"
