    "# Exploring Pre-Processed text and Generating Features\n",
    "One of the challenges of text analysis is to convert unstructured and semi-structured text into a structured representation. This must be done prior to carrying out any text analysis tasks. This chapter will show you \n",
    "how to put some of those basic steps discussed in the previous chapter together to generate different vector\n",

    ">a **token** is an instance of a sequence of characters in some particular document that are grouped together as a useful semantic unit for processing;\n",
    "\n",
    "> a **type** is the class of all tokens containing the same character sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *type* is also a vocabulary entry. In other words, a vocabulary consists of a number of word types.\n",
    "The distinction between a type and its tokens is a distinction that separates a descriptive concept from\n",

    "This is quite similar to the distinction in object-oriented programming between classes and objects.\n",

    "The document collection that we are going to use is a set of Reuters articles that comes with NLTK.\n",
    "It contains 10788 Reuters articles in total and has been split into two subsets, training and testing.\n",
    "Although this collection has already been pre-processed (e.g., you can access the text at different levels, like raw text, tokens, and sentences),\n",

    "\n",
    "After text pre-processing has been completed, each individual document needs to be transformed into \n",
    "some kind of numeric representation that can be input into most NLP and text mining algorithms.\n",
    "For example, classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine, can only take data in a \n",
    "structured and numerical form. They do not accept free languge text.\n",
    "The most popular structured representation of text is the vector-space model, which represents text\n",
    "as a vector where the elements of the vector indicate the occurence of words within the text.\n",
    "The vector-space model makes an implicit assumption that \n",
    "the order of words in a text document are not as\n",
    "important as words themselves, and thus disregarded.\n",
    "This assumpiton is called [**Bag-of-words**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of documents and a pre-defined list of words appearing \n",
    "in those documents (i.e., a vocabulary), you can compute a vector representation for each document.\n",
    "This vector representation can take one of the following three forms:\n",
    "* a binary representation,\n",
    "* an integer count,\n",
    "* and a float-valued weighted vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To highlight the difference among the three approaches, we use a very simple example as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    document_1: \"Data analysis is important.\"\n",
    "    document_2: \"Data wrangling is as important as data analysis.\"\n",
    "    document_3: \"Data science contains data analysis and data wrangling.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The three documents contain 20 tokens and 9 unique words.\n",
    "Those unique words are sorted alphabetically with total counts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "     'analysis': 3,\n",
    "     'and': 1,\n",
    "     'as': 2,\n",
    "     'contains': 1,\n",
    "     'data': 6,\n",
    "     'important': 2,\n",
    "     'is': 2,\n",
    "     'science': 1,\n",
    "     'wrangling': 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Given the vocabulary above, \n",
    "both the binary and the integer count vectors are easy to compute.\n",
    "A binary vector stores 1s for the word that appears in a document and 0s for the other words in\n",
    "the vocabulary,\n",
    "whereas a count vector stores the frequency of each word appearing in the document.\n",
    "Thus, the binary vector representations for the three documents above are\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ||'analysis'|'and'|'as'|'contains'|'data'|'important'|'is'|'science'|'wrangling'|\n",

    "   |document 3:|1|1|0|1|1|0|0|1|1|\n",
    "\n",
    "The count vector representations for the same documents would look as follows:\n",

    "Instead of using the two vector representations above, \n",
    "most existing text analysis algorithms, like document classification and information retrieval, \n",
    "prefer representing documents as weighted vectors.\n",
    "The raw term frequency is often replaced with a weighted term frequency\n",
    "that indicates how important a word is in a particular document.\n",
    "There are many different term weighting schemes online.\n",
    "To store each document as a weighted vector, we first need to choose a weighting scheme. \n",
    "The most popular scheme is the TF-IDF weighting approach. \n",
    "TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. \n",
    "The term frequency for a word is the number of times the word appears in a document. \n",
    "In the preceding example, the term frequency in Document 2 for “data” is 2, since it appears twice in the document. Document frequency for a word is the number of documents that contain the word; \n",
    "it would also be 3 for “data” in the collection of the three preceding documents. \n",
    "The Wikipidia entry on [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) lists \n",

    "\n",
    "$$tf(w,d)\\,=\\, \\sum_{i}^{|d|} 1_{w = w_{d,i}}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$idf(w) = log\\left(\\frac{|D|}{|d \\in D: w \\in d |}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption behind TF-IDF is that words with high term frequency should receive high weight unless they also have high document frequency. \n",
    "Stopwords are the most commonly occurring words in the English language. They often occur many times within a single document, but they also occur in nearly every document. \n",
    "These two competing effects cancel out to give them low weights,\n",
    "as those very common words carry very little meaningful information about the actual contents of the document.\n",
    "Therefore, the TF-IDF weights for stopwords are almost always 0.\n",
    "With the TF-DF formulas above,\n",
    "the weighted vector representations for the example documents are computed as\n",

    "## 4. Extracting Other Features\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common for most text analysis tasks to treat documents as bags-of-words, which can significantly simplify the inference procedure of text analysis algorithms. \n",
    "However, things always have pros and cons. \n",
    "The bag-of-words representation loses lots of information encoded in either syntax or word order (i.e., dependencies between adjacent words in sentences.). \n",
    "For example, representing a document as a collection of unigrams effectively disregards any word order dependence,\n",
    "which fails to capture phrases and multi-word expressions. A similar issue has been mentioned in section 2.1. of Chapter 2. \n",
    "In this section, we are going to show you how to\n",
    "* use Part-of-Speeching (POS) tagging to extract specific word groups, such as all nouns, verbs, etc.,\n",
    "* extract n-grams,\n",
    "*  and extract collocations\n",
    "\n",
    "These features can be further used to enrich the representation of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Extracting Nouns and Verbs\n",
    "It is easy for human to tell the difference between nouns, verbs, \n",
    "adjectives and adverbs, as we have learnt them back in elementary school.\n",
    "However, how can we automatically classify words into their parts of speech (i.e., lexical categories or word classes) \n",
    "and label them accordingly with computer program? \n",
    "This section is not going to discuss how to determine the category of a word from a linguistic perspective.\n",
    "Instead it demonstrates the use of some existing POS taggers to extract words in a specific lexical category.\n",
    "It has been proven that words together with their part-of-speech (POS) are quite useful for many language processing tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In NLP, the process of labelling words with their corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tags is known as [POS tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging).\n",
    "A POS tagger processes a sequence of words and attaches a POS tag to each word based on both its definition and its context. There are many POS taggers available online, such as [Sandford POS tagger](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml). \n",
    "We are going to use the one implemented by NLTK."
