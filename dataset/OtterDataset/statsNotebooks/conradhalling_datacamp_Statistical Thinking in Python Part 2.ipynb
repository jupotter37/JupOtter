    "> A test statistic is a single number that can be computed from observed data and also from data you simulate under the null hypothesis. It serves as a basis of comparison between what the hypothesis predicts and what we actually observed. Importantly, you should choose your test statistic to be something that is pertinent to the question you are trying to answer with your hypothesis test, in this case, are the two states different? If they are identical, they should have the same mean vote share for Obama. So the difference in mean vote share should be zero. We will therefore choose the difference in means as our test statistic.\n",

    "> In looking at the plot, we see that beaks got deeper (the red points are higher up in the y-direction), but not really longer. If anything, they got a bit shorter, since the red dots are to the left of the blue dots. So, it does not look like the beaks kept the same shape; they became shorter and deeper."
