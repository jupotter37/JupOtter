Given a standard deviation of 160 seconds, to allow for the extraction of significant results with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, a sample size of at least 894 individuals is needed, which will require additional funding."

    "\n",
    "Home advantage in sports is a phenomenon where individuals or teams playing in a home venue will perform better compared to playing away. Several factors can contribute to this advantage, such as familiarity with the venue or environment, crowd support, or travel fatigue. Understanding these factors can help athletes prepare better for away competitions and guide sports organizations in mitigating excessive home advantage to ensure fairer competition."

    "However, it is essential to note that home advantage can manifest differently in different sports. In this report, we are interested in investigating whether home advantage exists for the Cherry Blossom Race—a ten-mile race every April in Washington, D.C. For this competition, we consider local or “home” competitors to be runners from D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, while non-local or “away” runners originate from other locations. Since there are many runners in this race, not all can start at the starting line, so the time it takes a runner to reach the starting line after a race begins will vary. Runners who are local and familiar with the area and race course may be able to get to the race earlier, resulting in them starting in front and taking less time to reach the starting line.\n"

    "For this report, we sampled data from a Mosaic data set called TenMileRace. As described previously, individuals originally from D.C., Maryland, or Virginia are considered local, while individuals from different areas are non-local. We then sampled thirty runners from the data set, which consisted of twenty local (n1 = 20) and ten non-local runners (n2 = 10). After this, we determined the time each athlete took to reach the starting line (lag time) by subtracting their official race time (the time it took to complete the race after crossing the starting line) from their total race time (the total time it took to complete the race after it began). These times can be visualized below:\n"

Additionally, the histograms of the time local and non-local runners took to reach the starting line are not normal and are somewhat right-skewed. Because of this and our small sample size of thirty, we are not confident that the central limit theorem is in effect. As a result, we will analyze the significance of the differences observed in lag time between local and non-local runners through a randomization test, which we will discuss further in section 3 of this report."

Calculating the difference in lag time between local and non-local runners, we get -69.75 seconds, meaning non-local runners were, on average, 69.75 seconds faster to reach the starting line than their local counterparts. In addition, the average difference in lag time has 95% confidence intervals of -218.34 to 78.84 seconds. Finally, we computed a p-value of 0.34 and a t-score of -0.97 for this data."

Observing the histograms of local and non-local lag times seen in Figure 1, we are not confident that the central limit theorem is in effect. Because of this, we implemented a randomization test to test the statistical significance of our existing data against the null hypothesis further. We do this by shuffling the lag times of local and non-local runners 1000 times, calculating the t-score of each iteration under the null hypothesis, and plotting them in a histogram. Afterward, we compare our observed t-score with the randomly generated t-scores, thus assessing the probability of observing our existing lag times under the null hypothesis.

In other words, an advantage based on a competitor’s locality does not exist for runners in this race.\n"

This indicates great uncertainty for this statistic, meaning there is a high probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true."

Being a local could incentivize runners of all abilities to participate in the race due to their proximity.
