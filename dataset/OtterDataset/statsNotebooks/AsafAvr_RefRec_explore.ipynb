      "content=\"Upon reviewing the cases, I notice a pattern of significant discrepancies between the actual labels and predicted probabilities. Here are some observations and potential insights:\\n\\n1. **Consistent underprediction**: In most cases, the predicted probabilities are significantly lower than the actual labels, which are all 1.00. This suggests that the model is consistently underpredicting the true labels.\\n2. **Lack of calibration**: The predicted probabilities are not well-calibrated, as they are consistently far from the true labels. This could indicate that the model is not well-calibrated or that there are issues with the training data or model architecture.\\n3. ** Limited model accuracy**: The significant differences between actual labels and predicted probabilities suggest that the model is not accurately predicting the true labels. This could be due to various factors, such as insufficient training data, inadequate model complexity, or poor feature engineering.\\n4. **Overfitting or underfitting**: The consistent pattern of underprediction could indicate that the model is either overfitting or underfitting the training data. Overfitting would result in the model being too specialized to the training data, while underfitting would result in the model being too simple to capture the underlying patterns.\\n5. **Data quality issues**: The discrepancies could also be due to issues with the quality of the training data, such as noisy or biased labels, which can affect the model's ability to learn accurate patterns.\\n\\nTo address these issues, I would recommend:\\n\\n1. **Collecting more data**: Gathering more data to improve the model's accuracy and calibration.\\n2. **Model tuning**: Adjusting the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance and calibration.\\n3. **Feature engineering**: Exploring additional features that could help the model better capture the underlying patterns.\\n4. **Data preprocessing**: Ensuring that the training data is of high quality and free from noise or biases.\\n5. **Model selection**: Considering alternative models or architectures that may be better suited to the problem at hand.\\n\\nBy addressing these potential issues, it may be possible to improve the model's accuracy and calibration, reducing the significant discrepancies between actual labels and predicted probabilities.\" response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 431, 'prompt_tokens': 448, 'total_tokens': 879, 'completion_time': 1.218526289, 'prompt_time': 0.158581577, 'queue_time': None, 'total_time': 1.377107866}, 'model_name': 'llama3-70b-8192', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_753a4aecf6', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-72e91644-4e4c-426e-83d4-35272cec3e2a-0'\n",
