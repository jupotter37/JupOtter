        "# Starship SQL: An Introduction to Databases\n",
        "### Databases Through Pop Culture: Brendan SHea, PhD\n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to the world of databases, highlighting their importance in managing and organizing data effectively. By drawing parallels between database concepts and scenarios from the beloved science fiction franchise, Star Trek, the chapter aims to make these concepts more relatable and easier to grasp. Readers will explore the distinctions between data, information, and knowledge, and learn about various data models, including flat files, relational databases, document databases, and graph databases. The chapter also delves into the process of data modeling, discussing the conceptual, logical, and physical levels of abstraction. Additionally, it covers the selection of appropriate database management systems and the choice between cloud storage and local storage. Finally, the chapter explores different concepts of data storage, including data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts.\n",

        "Welcome aboard the Starship Enterprise, a iconic vessel from the beloved science fiction franchise, Star Trek. In this introductory chapter, we'll be exploring the fascinating world of databases using examples and scenarios inspired by the adventures of the Enterprise and its intrepid crew.\n",
        "\n",
        "But why use a fictional spaceship to learn about databases? The answer lies in the versatility and universal applicability of database concepts. Whether you're managing a starship, a small business, or a global enterprise, the principles of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation remain the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "By setting our learning journey against the backdrop of the Enterprise's missions, we can make the abstract concepts of databases more relatable and easier to grasp. We'll see how databases can help us solve real-world problems, from organizing crew schedules to analyzing sensor data from uncharted planets. As we embark on this journey together, we'll demystify the world of databases and discover how they can help us navigate the complexities of data in the 21st century.\n",

        "## What's the Difference Between Data, Information, and Knowledge?\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand the role of databases, it's essential to grasp the distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Let's beam down to a planet's surface with the Enterprise's away team and explore these concepts in action.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data** refers to raw, unorganized facts and figures. Imagine the Enterprise's sensors collecting various readings about the planet's atmosphere, temperature, and geology. These individual measurements, such as \"Nitrogen: 78.1%,\" \"Oxygen: 20.9%,\" and \"Temperature: 25°C,\" are data points. On their own, they don't provide much insight or meaning. Examples of data include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"Temperature: 25°C\"\n",
        "2. \"Gravity: 9.8 m/s²\"\n",
        "3. \"Radiation levels: 0.5 mSv/hr\"\n",
        "4. \"Soil pH: 6.5\"\n",
        "5. \"Atmospheric pressure: 1.01 bar\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Information** is data that has been processed, structured, and given context. When the Enterprise's computer systems analyze the sensor data and present it in a meaningful way, such as \"The planet's atmosphere is similar to Earth's, with a slightly higher oxygen content,\" it becomes information. This level of organization and interpretation makes the data more useful and accessible. Examples of information include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"The planet's average temperature is similar to Earth's, suitable for human habitation.\"\n",
        "2. \"The gravity on this planet is approximately equal to Earth's, which means the crew can move around easily.\"\n",
        "3. \"Radiation levels are within safe limits for short-term exposure, but prolonged stays may require protective gear.\"\n",
        "4. \"The soil pH indicates that the ground is slightly acidic, which may affect the growth of certain plants.\"\n",
        "5. \"Atmospheric pressure is comparable to Earth's at sea level, allowing for normal breathing.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Knowledge** is the understanding and application of information. When the Enterprise's science officer, Mr. Spock, reviews the atmospheric information and concludes, \"Captain, this planet is capable of supporting human life,\" he demonstrates knowledge. By combining the information with his expertise and experience, Spock can make informed decisions and recommendations. Examples of knowledge include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"Based on the temperature and atmospheric data, this planet is classified as habitable for humans, and we can proceed with landing without special equipment.\"\n",
        "2. \"The similar gravity to Earth's means that our standard transportation vehicles and equipment will function normally on this planet.\"\n",
        "3. \"While the radiation levels are safe for now, we should limit our time on the surface and regularly monitor our exposure to prevent long-term health risks.\"\n",
        "4. \"The slightly acidic soil suggests that we may need to adjust our agricultural techniques and select crops that can thrive in this environment.\"\n",
        "5. \"With the atmospheric pressure being similar to Earth's, we can rule out the need for specialized breathing apparatus, making our exploration more efficient.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In this scenario, a database would serve as the central repository for storing and organizing the raw sensor data. By structuring the data into tables, rows, and columns, the database makes it easier to process and analyze the information. The Enterprise's crew can then query the database to gain insights, identify patterns, and ultimately, generate knowledge to guide their actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose the away team discovers a new plant species. They can collect data on its physical characteristics, chemical composition, and genetic structure, storing it in the database. By comparing this information with records of known plants, the crew can determine whether the species is edible, medicinal, or potentially dangerous. This knowledge can then be used to ensure the safety and well-being of the crew during their mission."

        "## What is a Database? How Can They Help Turn Data Into Knowledge?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **database** is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information. Databases are designed to handle large amounts of data and provide a reliable and secure way to manage and access that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a **flat file** is a simple, **linear** structure that stores data in a single table or spreadsheet. (Linear means the data is arrnaged in a \"line\", where searching for a record requires going through all of the previous records). Flat files are easy to create and understand but have limitations when dealing with complex data relationships and large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider an example from the Starship Enterprise. Suppose the crew is tasked with cataloging the various alien species they encounter during their missions. Using a flat file, they might create a spreadsheet with columns for species name, planet of origin, physical characteristics, and level of technological advancement.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this approach may work for a small number of entries, it quickly becomes cumbersome as the list grows. Searching for specific information, updating records, and maintaining data consistency becomes increasingly difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a database can store this information in a more organized and efficient manner. By breaking the data into separate tables for species, planets, and technological levels, and establishing relationships between these tables, the database can provide a more comprehensive and flexible way to manage the information.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, the database can ensure that each species is linked to its correct planet of origin, prevent duplicate entries, and allow for easy updating of information across multiple records. The crew can then use **queries** to search for specific species based on various criteria, such as all species from a particular planet or those with a certain level of technological advancement. In a database, data is stored non-linearly, which means searching for data items does not require going through all \"previous\" entries first.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, databases can help turn data into knowledge by enabling complex analysis and pattern recognition. By using **data mining** techniques, the Enterprise's science team can uncover hidden relationships and trends within the species data. They might discover that certain physical characteristics are correlated with higher levels of technological advancement, or that species from certain regions of space are more likely to be hostile.\n",
        "\n",
        "This knowledge can then inform the crew's decision-making processes and help them prepare for future encounters. For example, if the database analysis reveals that species with certain features tend to be more aggressive, the Enterprise can adjust its diplomatic approach or defensive strategies accordingly."

        "## What is \"Data Modeling\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step to the creation of a database is to create a \"data model.\" Here, **data modeling** is the process of analyzing and defining the structure, relationships, and constraints of an organization's data to create a standardized representation of the data that will be stored in a database. This representation serves as a blueprint for the database system, guiding its design, development, and maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data modeling involves understanding the business requirements, identifying the entities (objects or concepts) that need to be represented, and determining how these entities relate to each other. The goal is to create a model that accurately reflects the organization's data needs, supports its business processes, and enables efficient data management.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data modeling process typically involves three main levels of abstraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Conceptual Data Model**: This high-level model focuses on capturing the overall structure of the data and the relationships between different entities, without delving into the specifics of implementation. At this stage, data modelers work closely with stakeholders to understand their requirements, identify the main data entities, and define the business rules that govern the data. The conceptual model is often represented using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), which visually depict the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.\n",
        "2.  **Logical Data Model**: The logical model takes the conceptual model and refines it to provide a more detailed, technology-independent representation of the data structure. At this level, data modelers decide on the specific data attributes, data types, and the relationships between entities. They also define the primary keys, foreign keys, and any constraints or rules that govern the data. The logical model is still independent of the specific database technology being used, allowing for flexibility in implementation. Depending on the organization's needs, the logical model may be represented using a relational model (for SQL databases), a document model (for NoSQL databases like MongoDB), or other data models.\n",
        "3.  **Physical Data Model**: The physical model is a technology-specific representation of the logical model, taking into account the specific database management system being used and any performance or storage considerations. This model includes details such as table structures, indexes, and data types. For the Enterprise, the physical model would be the actual implementation of the crew management system using a specific database technology, like PostgreSQL or Oracle.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate the data modeling process, let's consider the Starship Enterprise's mission planning system. At the conceptual level, the data modelers would identify entities such as \"Mission,\" \"Starship,\" \"Crew Member,\" and \"Planet,\" and define the relationships between them (e.g., a Mission involves a Starship and a Crew, and may take place on a Planet). They would also define business rules, such as \"each Mission must have at least one Crew Member assigned to it.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "At the logical level, the data modelers would refine the model by adding attributes to each entity (e.g., Mission has a start date, end date, and objective), and determining the cardinality of the relationships (e.g., a Starship can have many Missions, but a Mission is associated with only one Starship). They would also choose the appropriate data model, such as a relational model, based on the organization's requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, at the physical level, the data modelers would translate the logical model into a specific database schema, defining tables, columns, data types, and any database-specific optimizations needed to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this data modeling process, the Starship Enterprise can ensure that its mission planning system is well-structured, efficient, and aligned with the organization's needs, enabling effective data management and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following sections, we'll take a brief look at the most common logical data models. In later chapters, we will consider each type of modeling in much greater detail."

        "### The Entity-Relationship Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model is a visual representation used primarily in the conceptual and logical stages of data modeling. It provides a way to describe the data requirements of an organization in a graphical format, making it easier for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand and validate the data structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key components of the ER Model include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Entities**: These represent distinct objects or concepts in the system (e.g., Mission, Starship, Crew Member).\n",
        "2.  **Attributes**: These are properties or characteristics of entities (e.g., mission start date, starship name, crew member rank).\n",
        "3.  **Relationships**: These show how entities are related to each other (e.g., a Mission is assigned to a Starship).\n",
        "4.  **Cardinality**: This indicates the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with the other entity in a relationship (e.g., one Starship can have many Missions, but each Mission is associated with only one Starship).\n",
        "\n",
        "The ER Model fits into the data modeling process as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   In the **Conceptual Data Model** stage, a high-level ER diagram is created to capture the main entities and their relationships, without including all the detailed attributes. This helps stakeholders understand the overall structure of the data.\n",
        "-   In the **Logical Data Model** stage, the ER diagram is refined to include all attributes, specify data types, and define the cardinality of relationships. This more detailed ER model serves as a bridge between the conceptual understanding and the actual database implementation.\n",
        "-   When moving to the **Physical Data Model**, the ER diagram is translated into the specific schema of the chosen database system. For relational databases, entities typically become tables, attributes become columns, and relationships are implemented through primary and foreign keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using the Entity-Relationship Model throughout the data modeling process, organizations like Starfleet can ensure that their data structures are well-defined, easily understood by all stakeholders, and accurately represent the complex relationships in their systems, such as those between missions, starships, crew members, and explored planets."

        "## Logical Data Models: The Relational Model\n",
        "\n",
        "The **relational model** is the most widely used logical data models, particularly in SQL (Structured Query Language) databases. In the relational model, data is organized into tables (also known as relations), with each table consisting of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). The relational model provides a simple, flexible, and powerful way to represent and manipulate data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts in the relational model include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Tables**: A table is a collection of related data entries, organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a single entity or concept, such as \"Crew Member\" or \"Mission.\"\n",
        "2.  **Columns**: Each column in a table represents a specific attribute of the entity, such as \"Name,\" \"Rank,\" or \"Employee ID\" for the \"Crew Member\" table.\n",
        "3.  **Rows**: Each row in a table represents a unique instance of the entity, such as a specific crew member or mission.\n",
        "4.  **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. For example, in the \"Crew Member\" table, the \"Employee ID\" could be the primary key.\n",
        "5.  **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column (or set of columns) in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables. For example, the \"Mission\" table might have a foreign key \"Crew Member ID\" that refers to the primary key \"Employee ID\" in the \"Crew Member\" table.\n",
        "6.  **Relationships**: Relationships define how tables are connected to each other based on their primary and foreign keys. The three main types of relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate the relational model, let's consider a simplified example of the Starship Enterprise's crew management system. We'll define two tables: \"Crew Member\" and \"Department.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Crew Member Table**\n",
        "\n",
        "| Employee ID (PK) | Name | Rank | Department ID (FK) |\n",
        "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
        "| 1 | James Kirk | Captain | 1 |\n",
        "| 2 | Spock | Commander | 2 |\n",
        "| 3 | Uhura | Lieutenant | 3 |\n",
        "| 4 | Leonard McCoy | Lieutenant | 4 |\n",
        "\n",
        "**Department Table**\n",
        "\n",
        "| Department ID (PK) | Department Name |\n",
        "| --- | --- |\n",
        "| 1 | Command |\n",
        "| 2 | Science |\n",
        "| 3 | Communications |\n",
        "| 4 | Medical |\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the \"Crew Member\" table has a primary key \"Employee ID\" and a foreign key \"Department ID,\" which references the primary key \"Department ID\" in the \"Department\" table. This establishes a one-to-many relationship between the two tables, as each crew member belongs to a single department, but a department can have multiple crew members.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using this relational model, the Enterprise can easily store, retrieve, and manipulate data about its crew members and departments. For example, they can query the database to find all crew members belonging to a specific department or join the two tables to retrieve the department name for each crew member. The link between primary and foreign keys allows relational databases to provide strong support for **referential integrity** (basically, that the foreign key points to a \"real\" primary key in another table).\n",
        "\n",
        "The relational model provides a strong foundation for organizing and managing data in a structured and efficient manner, and has been the dominant model since the 1970s. Leading database management software such as Oracle, MySQL, PosgtreSQL, Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL server, and SQLite are are all based on the relational model. We'll focus much of our attention on this data model."

JSON provides a flexible and intuitive structure for organizing data, making it well-suited for handling semi-structured and hierarchical data.\n",

        "Document databases, such as MongoDB and Couchbase, leverage the JSON format (or a binary variant like BSON) to store data as semi-structured documents. Each document can have a different structure, allowing for flexible and schema-less data storage. This flexibility enables developers to easily modify the data structure as application requirements evolve, without the need for costly schema migrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most modern \"relational\" database management systems (mentioned above) also have the ability to interact natively with JSON. Later in this book, we'll see how this works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features and advantages of JSON and document databases include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Flexibility**: JSON allows for the storage of semi-structured and unstructured data, accommodating evolving data requirements and enabling rapid application development.\n",
        "2.  **Scalability**: Document databases are designed to scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data and high read/write throughput.\n",
        "3.  **Performance**: By storing related data together within a single document, document databases can reduce the need for expensive joins and improve read performance.\n",
        "4.  **Expressive Query Languages**: Document databases often provide expressive query languages that support complex queries, indexing, and aggregation operations on JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to relational databases, JSON and document databases offer a different approach to data modeling and storage. While relational databases enforce a strict, predefined schema and normalize data across multiple tables, JSON and document databases allow for flexible, denormalized data storage within a single document. This approach can simplify data modeling and improve performance for certain use cases, particularly when dealing with rapidly changing or unstructured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's important to note that relational databases still excel in scenarios that require strong data consistency, complex transactions, and rigorous ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. The choice between JSON/document databases and relational databases depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as data structure, scalability needs, and consistency guarantees.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of the Starship Enterprise, a document database using JSON could be used to store and manage various types of data, such as mission reports, crew profiles, and sensor readings, allowing for flexible and easily extensible data representation. The ability to nest objects and arrays within JSON documents enables the creation of rich, hierarchical data structures that can be efficiently queried and updated, supporting the diverse data management needs of the Enterprise.."

        "### Logical Model: Graphs for Networks of Connected Information\n",
        "\n",
        "In our exploration of data models, we've seen how tables organize data in rows and columns, and how documents can nest related information hierarchically. Graph databases take a fundamentally different approach: they represent data as networks of interconnected entities. This approach is particularly powerful when relationships between data are as important as the data itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Understanding Graph Models\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a graph database as a representation of a complex network, much like the interconnected nature of Starfleet itself. Each person, ship, or location is represented as a node (or vertex) in the network. These nodes are connected by edges (or relationships) that represent how they interact or relate to each other. Both nodes and edges can have properties – additional information that describes them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the command structure of the USS Enterprise. Captain Kirk, Commander Spock, and Dr. McCoy would each be represented as nodes. The reporting relationships between them are edges – Spock and McCoy both have \"reports_to\" relationships pointing to Kirk. We can also record properties about each entity: Kirk's node might have properties like rank=\"Captain\", species=\"Human\", and assignment_date=\"2265\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-World Applications in the Star Trek Universe\n",
        "\n",
        "The true power of graph databases becomes apparent when we look at more complex scenarios. Consider mapping the diplomatic relations of the United Federation of Planets. Each member world is a node, connected by various types of relationships: trade agreements, military alliances, cultural exchanges, and even conflicts. Earth might have a \"founding_member\" relationship with the Federation, while Vulcan has both \"member_of\" and \"trade_partner\" relationships with multiple worlds.\n",
        "\n",
        "These relationships can be queried in fascinating ways. Want to find all planets that trade with Federation members but aren't members themselves? Or perhaps you need to identify the shortest diplomatic chain between Earth and the Klingon Empire during peace negotiations? Graph databases excel at these types of queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When Graph Models Make Sense\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph models are particularly valuable in scenarios where the connections between entities reveal important patterns or insights. Key use cases include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Network Analysis: Understanding command structures, supply chains, or communication networks\n",
        "- Path Finding: Discovering routes between distant star systems or tracking the spread of information\n",
        "- Pattern Detection: Identifying similar relationship patterns across different parts of the network\n",
        "- Impact Analysis: Understanding how changes in one part of the network affect connected entities\n",
        "\n",
        "## Querying Graph Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph data can be represented and queried in different ways. Let's look at two popular approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Property Graphs (Neo4j)\n",
        "In Neo4j, we use pattern-matching queries. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```cypher\n",
        "MATCH (officer:Officer)-[:SERVES_ON]->(ship:Starship)\n",
        "WHERE ship.name = \"USS Enterprise\"\n",
        "RETURN officer.name, officer.rank\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### RDF Triples\n",
        "RDF represents data as subject-predicate-object triples. The same Enterprise crew data might look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "```turtle\n",
        "@prefix starfleet: <http://starfleet.org/ontology/> .\n",
        "@prefix crew: <http://starfleet.org/crew/> .\n",
        "@prefix ship: <http://starfleet.org/ship/> .\n",
        "\n",
        "crew:kirk a starfleet:Officer ;\n",
        "    starfleet:name \"James T. Kirk\" ;\n",
        "    starfleet:rank \"Captain\" ;\n",
        "    starfleet:servesOn ship:enterprise .\n",
        "\n",
        "ship:enterprise a starfleet:Starship ;\n",
        "    starfleet:name \"USS Enterprise\" ;\n",
        "    starfleet:registry \"NCC-1701\" .\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Both approaches let us find relationships between entities, though they use different query languages and conventions. RDF is particularly good at linking data across different systems using standardized vocabularies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Practical Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "While graph databases excel at relationship-heavy scenarios, they're not always the best choice. Simple hierarchical data might be better served by a document model. Large-scale analytical queries over uniform data often work better with columnar storage. The key is understanding your data's natural structure and how it will be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider Starfleet's needs: while personnel assignments and command structures work well in a graph model, ship maintenance logs or sensor readings might be better suited to other data models. Many modern systems combine multiple models, using graphs where they make sense while employing other models for different aspects of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Real-World Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at a concrete example of how the USS Enterprise's crew and mission data might be modeled in a graph database:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Nodes represent entities like crew members, ships, starbases, and planets\n",
        "- Edges show relationships: command structure, ship assignments, mission participation\n",
        "- Properties on both nodes and edges provide additional context:\n",
        "  - Node properties: name, rank, species, technical specifications\n",
        "  - Edge properties: assignment dates, mission outcomes, relationship types\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure makes it easy to answer complex questions like \"Which officers have served under both Captain Kirk and Captain Pike?\" or \"What's the chain of command between any two crew members?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Through graph databases, we can represent and query complex networks of relationships in ways that would be cumbersome or impossible with other data models. They provide a natural way to think about and work with interconnected data, making them an invaluable tool in the modern data architect's toolkit."

        "While relational databases excel at managing complex relationships between entities (like connecting ships to their crews and missions) and document/JSON models are great for nested, hierarchical data (like detailed ship specifications), there's another powerful way to organize data that's become central to modern data analytics: the column-oriented approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Core Idea: Thinking in Columns\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at a mission log from the Starship Enterprise, organized as a \"tidy dataframe\":\n",
        "\n",
        "| crew_name | mission_date | planet | mission_type | injuries | new_species |\n",
        "|-----------|--------------|--------|--------------|----------|-------------|\n",
        "| Kirk      | 2265-03-15  | Vulcan | Diplomatic   | 0        | 0           |\n",
        "| Spock     | 2265-03-15  | Vulcan | Diplomatic   | 0        | 0           |\n",
        "| McCoy     | 2265-04-01  | Rigel  | Medical      | 2        | 1           |\n",
        "| Kirk      | 2265-04-01  | Rigel  | Medical      | 0        | 1           |\n",
        "\n",
        "In a column-oriented organization, we think about each column as its own unit of analysis. Instead of storing this as rows (like a relational database would) or as nested JSON documents (like MongoDB would), tools like Pandas, DuckDB, and BigQuery organize the data more like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "crew_name: [\"Kirk\", \"Spock\", \"McCoy\", \"Kirk\"]\n",
        "mission_date: [\"2265-03-15\", \"2265-03-15\", \"2265-04-01\", \"2265-04-01\"]\n",
        "planet: [\"Vulcan\", \"Vulcan\", \"Rigel\", \"Rigel\"]\n",
        "mission_type: [\"Diplomatic\", \"Diplomatic\", \"Medical\", \"Medical\"]\n",
        "injuries: [0, 0, 2, 0]\n",
        "new_species: [0, 0, 1, 1]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Organize Data This Way?\n",
        "\n",
        "The column-oriented approach shines when you're doing analysis that focuses on patterns across columns. Common analytical questions become very natural:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"What's our average number of injuries per mission?\"\n",
        "   - Just grab the injuries column and calculate its mean\n",
        "   - No need to touch any other columns\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \"How many different types of missions have we done?\"\n",
        "   - Just grab the mission_type column and count unique values\n",
        "   - Other columns stay untouched\n",
        "\n",
        "3. \"What's the distribution of missions across planets?\"\n",
        "   - Focus on the planet column for counting\n",
        "   - Don't need to load crew or date information\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When to Use Column-Oriented Organization\n",
        "\n",
        "Column organization works best when:\n",
        "- You're analyzing patterns across many rows (like mission statistics)\n",
        "- Your data naturally fits in a \"tidy\" format where:\n",
        "  - Each column is a variable (like date, location, outcome)\n",
        "  - Each row is an observation (like a specific mission)\n",
        "  - Each value sits at the intersection of a variable and observation\n",
        "- You're doing lots of aggregations (counts, averages, etc.)\n",
        "- Your analysis focuses on specific columns rather than whole rows\n",
        "\n",
        "#### When Not to Use Column Organization\n",
        "\n",
        "Stick to relational or document models when:\n",
        "- You need to maintain complex relationships between different types of data\n",
        "  - Example: Tracking crew members, their positions, their missions, and mission outcomes might be better in a relational database\n",
        "- Your data is deeply nested\n",
        "  - Example: Detailed ship specifications with subsystems within systems might work better as JSON\n",
        "- You frequently need to access complete records rather than analyze patterns\n",
        "  - Example: Looking up all details about a specific mission might be faster in a traditional database\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Modern Tools for Column-Oriented Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Several modern tools make it easy to work with column-oriented data:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pandas/R Dataframes**: Perfect for data analysis in code\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   # Calculating average injuries per mission type\n",
        "   missions.groupby('mission_type')['injuries'].mean()\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **DuckDB**: A super-fast analytical database that thinks in columns\n",
        "   ```sql\n",
        "   -- Same analysis in SQL\n",
        "   SELECT mission_type, AVG(injuries)\n",
        "   FROM missions\n",
        "   GROUP BY mission_type;\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **BigQuery/Redshift**: Cloud databases optimized for column-oriented analytics\n",
        "   - Can analyze massive datasets quickly\n",
        "   - Automatically optimize column storage for performance\n",
        "\n",
        "In the the end, the power of column-oriented data model comes from matching how we organize data to how we analyze it. When your analysis focuses on patterns, trends, and relationships between variables, organizing your data by columns makes these analyses natural and efficient."

        "## Physical Models: Choosing a DBMS\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to storing and managing data for your application, you'll need to choose a suitable database system. But before diving into the different options, let's understand what a **database management system (DBMS)** is.\n",
        "\n",
        "A DBMS is software that allows you to create, organize, and interact with databases. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. Think of it as a sophisticated filing cabinet that helps you keep your data organized and easily accessible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's explore the different types of databases you can choose from:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **File Database (e.g., SQLite)**: Imagine you're developing a small application for a personal tricorder device. In such cases, a file database like SQLite could be a great choice. SQLite is lightweight, easy to set up, and stores the entire database as a single file on your device. It's perfect for applications that don't require multi-user access or complex data management, just like a tricorder's simple data storage needs.\n",
        "2.  **Personal Database (e.g., Microsoft Access)**: If you're building a small-scale application for managing crew member records on a single computer, a personal database like Microsoft Access might be suitable. Access provides a user-friendly interface for creating tables, forms, and reports. It's great for managing data that doesn't require extensive scalability or advanced features, similar to maintaining a local database on a starship's computer.\n",
        "3.  **Open-Source Client-Server Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)**: When your application needs to handle multiple users and requires more advanced functionality, like managing the Enterprise's crew and mission data, an open-source client-server database like MySQL or PostgreSQL could be the way to go. These databases are powerful, scalable, and offer a wide range of features. They are ideal for web applications, content management systems, and enterprise-level solutions. Just like how the Enterprise relies on robust databases to manage its vast amount of data across multiple systems and users.\n",
        "4.  **Proprietary Client-Server Database (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server)**: For large-scale, mission-critical applications that demand high performance, reliability, and advanced features, such as managing the entire Starfleet's data, proprietary client-server databases like Oracle or SQL Server are often the choice. These databases come with extensive support, comprehensive documentation, and a wide array of tools and utilities. They are trusted by large organizations, similar to how Starfleet would rely on top-notch database systems to handle its critical data.\n",
        "5.  **NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)**: In some cases, your application might deal with unstructured or semi-structured data, such as sensor readings from the Enterprise's scientific instruments or logs from various starship systems. NoSQL databases, like MongoDB or Cassandra, are designed to handle such data efficiently. They provide flexibility, scalability, and high performance for handling large volumes of diverse data types. Just like how the Enterprise would use specialized databases to store and analyze complex data from its missions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Differnt use cases call for different choices of DBMS. For example, for managing simple crew member records on a single computer, a personal database like Microsoft Access would suffice. However, for handling the vast amount of data generated by the Enterprise's sensors, scientific instruments, and logs, a combination of an open-source client-server database like PostgreSQL and a NoSQL database like MongoDB would be more suitable."

        "## What is SQL?\n",
        "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. Remember how we discussed the relational model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns? SQL is the practical implementation of that model - it's how we actually work with relational databases in the real world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like the relational model organizes data into relations (tables) with attributes (columns) and tuples (rows), SQL provides commands to create these structures and interact with the data within them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Our First Database Project: TV Shows\n",
        "Today, we'll create a simple database to store information about TV shows. We'll start with just one table to learn the basics. Later, we can expand this into a more complex database with multiple related tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Using Jupyter Notebook with SQL\n",
        "In this lab, we'll use Jupyter Notebook with SQLite, a lightweight database system perfect for learning. To write SQL commands, we'll use special code cells with the `%%sql` magic command. Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Click the '+' button in the toolbar to create a new cell\n",
        "2. Type `%%sql` as the first line of your cell\n",

        "\n",
        "(In what follows, I've created code cells for you).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tips for Success\n",
        "- Always end your SQL statements with a semicolon (;)\n",
        "- SQL keywords are typically written in UPPERCASE by convention, though this isn't required\n",
        "- Be careful with string values - they need single quotes ('like this')\n",
        "- If you make a mistake, don't worry! You can always drop the table and start over:\n",

        "## Advanced Data Storage Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we'll explore four fundamental concepts in data management: databases, data lakes, data warehouses, and data marts. We'll build on the basic idea of a relational database and see how these other concepts expand our ability to store and use data effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "### (Relational) Databases: The Foundation of Data Management\n",
        "\n",
        "As we've learned, database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. The most common type of database is a relational database, which organizes data into tables with rows and columns. This structure is based on the relational model, proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features of relational databases include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data integrity.** Ensuring data accuracy and consistency\n",
        "2.  **ACID properties.** Guaranteeing reliable transaction processing\n",
        "3.  **Normalization.** Organizing data to reduce redundancy\n",
        "4.  **Indexing.** Improving query performance\n",
        "\n",
        "While relational databases excel at handling structured data with clear relationships, they can be less flexible when dealing with unstructured or semi-structured data. This limitation led to the development of other data storage concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Lakes: Storing Raw, Unstructured Data\n",
        "A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it's needed. Unlike a relational database, a data lake can store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key characteristics of data lakes include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The structure of the data is not defined until it's retrieved (**Schema-on-read**).\n",
        "2.  Can store any type of data (text files, images, sensor data, etc.)\n",
        "3.  Can easily grow to accommodate large volumes of data (**scalability**).\n",
        "4.  Often uses commodity hardware for cost-effective storage\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Star Trek context, a data lake might store diverse information like sensor logs, crew reports, and alien artifact scans, all in their original formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data lakes are particularly useful for big data analytics and machine learning projects, where analysts might want to explore data in various ways not predetermined by a fixed schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Warehouses: Integrated Data for Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "A data warehouse is a system used for reporting and data analysis. It's a central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses use a process called ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to gather data from various sources, clean and standardize it, and load it into the warehouse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features of data warehouses include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Organized around major subjects (like customers or products)\n",
        "2.  Data from different sources is merged into a consistent format\n",
        "3.  Maintains historical data for trend analysis\n",
        "4.  Data is stable (**non-voliatile**); updates are made in batches, not in real-time\n",
        "\n",
        "Data warehouses often use a star schema or snowflake schema, which are variations of the relational model optimized for analytical queries. These schemas typically have a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our Star Trek example, Starfleet might use a data warehouse to analyze trends across all starship missions, integrating data from individual ship logs, personnel records, and scientific findings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Marts: Focused Subsets of Data Warehouses\n",
        "\n",
        "A data mart is a subset of a data warehouse oriented to a specific business line or team. It's essentially a condensed version of a data warehouse focused on a particular subject area.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key aspects of data marts include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Tailored to a particular business function or department\n",
        "2.  Contains less data than a full data warehouse\n",
        "3.  Due to their focused nature, queries often run faster\n",
        "4.  Often managed by specific business units, and are often used to provide **security**, by ensuring that people can't access data they don't \"need to know.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main approaches to creating data marts:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Top-down: Created from an existing enterprise-wide data warehouse\n",
        "-   Bottom-up: Created first, potentially integrated into a larger warehouse later\n",
        "\n",
        "In our Star Trek scenario, while Starfleet might have a central data warehouse, individual departments like Security or Engineering might have their own data marts tailored to their specific analytical needs."
