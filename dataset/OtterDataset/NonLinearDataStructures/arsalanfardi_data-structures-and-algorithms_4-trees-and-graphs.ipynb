Therefore, height of a tree with only a single node (root) would be 0. **Note**: I have also seen it as number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node, which would mean a single node has height of 1. This is something to clarify during interviews.\n",

    "#### Binary Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "A **min-heap** is a *complete* binary tree (that is, totally filled other than the rightmost elements on the last level) where each node is **smaller** than its children. The root is therefore the minimum element of the tree. **Max-heaps** are essentially equivalent but the elements are in descending order rather than ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/min-heap.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two key operations on a min-heap: insert and extract_min.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Insert\n",
    "**O(log n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the heap.\n",
    "- Start inserting the element at the next available spot at the bottom (looking left to right)\n",
    "    - This is done to maintain the complete property\n",
    "- Fix the tree by swapping the new element with its parent, until we find an appropriate spot for that element.\n",
    "    - We **bubble up** the minimum element\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Extract Minimum Element\n",
    "**O(log n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the heap. Note the minimum element is always the root node.\n",
    "- Remove the root node and swap it with the last element in the heap (the bottom rightmost element)\n",
    "- **Bubble down** this element by swapping it with one of its children until the min-heap property is restored\n",
    "    - When bubbling down, swap with the minimum element to maintain the min-heap ordering (doesn't matter if it is on the left or right)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Priority Queues\n",
    "A priority queue is an abstract data type in which each element has a priority queue associated with it. The higher priority elements are served first before the lower priority ones. A heap is commonly used to implement a priority queue to ensure O(log n) insertion and deletion of an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Heap Implementation\n",
    "Implementations of min-heap and max-heap as arrays are shown below. Note that when the root node is stored at index 1 instead of 0, the indices for the parent and children of any node become:\n",
    "- Parent: $i//2$\n",
    "- Left child: $2*i$\n",
    "- Right child: $2*i + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "A leaf node will also always have an index greater than *n//2* where n is the total number of nodes in the heap. The first element in the array will occasionally be instead used to store the size of the tree."

    "##### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "In BFS, node *a* visits each of *a*'s neighbours before visiting any of *their* neighbours. The main point with BFS is that it is not recursive, you will need to use a queue. Pseudocode for BFS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "void search(Node root):\n",
    "  Queue queue = new Queue()\n",
    "  root.marked = true\n",
    "  queue.enqueue(root)  // Add to the end of queue\n",
    "\n",
    "  while !queue.isEmpty():\n",
    "    Node r = queue.dequeue()  // Remove from the front of the queue\n",
    "    visit(r)\n",
    "    for each Node n in r.adjacent:\n",
    "      if n.marked == false:\n",
    "        n.marked = true\n",
    "        queue.enqueue(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity for BFS is **O(V + E)** where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is **O(V)** since in the worst case you may need to hold all vertices in the queue, although for larger graphs it may be represented using the *branching factor*. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search#Analysis) for an explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bidirectional Search\n",
    "Bidirectional search is used to find the shortest path between a source and destination node. It operates by essentially running two simultaneous breadth-first searches, one from each node. When their searches collide, we have found a path which is formed by merging the two paths. Note that if the graph is directed, it searches forward from *s* and backwards from *t*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why this is faster, consider a graph where every node has at most *k* adjacent nodes and the shortest path from node *s* to *t* has length *d*:\n",
    "- In traditional BFS, we search *k* nodes in the first level of the search, and *k* more for each of those first *k* nodes ($k^2$ nodes on the second level). We would do this d times, so that's O($k^d$) nodes.\n",
    "- In bidirectional search, the two searches collide after approximately $d/2$ levels (the midpoint of the path). Each serach visits $k^d/2$ nodes, which is approximately $2k^d/2$ or O($k^{d/2}$) nodes total. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bidirectional search is therefore faster by a factor of $k^{d/2}$.\n"
