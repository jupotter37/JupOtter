      "For any manufacturer to determine whether to increase or decrease the production of several units, \n",
      "data regarding the demand for produc ts on the market is required. Therefore the companies used \n",
      "to face losses while competing in the market since they don’t know how much to sell.  \n",

      "In this project, we propose a predictive model using linear regression te chnique for predicting sales \n",
      "in a supermarket. The major of this machine learning project is to build a predictive model and \n",

The industry has \\nfocused on conventional statistical model but in recent years, Machine learning techniques have \\nreceived more attention.  \\nThe use of traditional statistical method to forecast supermarket sales has left a lot of challenges \\nunaddressed and mostly result in the creation of predictive models that perform poorly.  \\nThe era of big data coupled with access to massive compute power has made machine learning a \\ngoto for sales forecast.  \\nThe objective of this project is to  develop a model f or predicting sales in supermarkets  keeping \\nin view sales  and the amount used to advertise.  \\nUsing regression analysis  product variables such as supermarket type, product price and \\nsupermarket opening year are used to predict the sales.  \\n \\n \\n

It’s also the determination of a firms \\nshare in the mark et under a specified future.  \\nEarlier companies used to produce goods without considering the number of sales and demand. \\nFor any manufacturer to determine whether to increase or decrease the production of several units, \\ndata regarding the demand for produc ts on the market is required. Therefore the companies used \\nto face losses while competing in the market since they don’t know how much to sell.  \\nManagers used to make sales predictions randomly. Professional managers however, become hard \\nto find and not alw ays available.  \\nIn today’s highly competitive and ever changing consumer landscape, accurate and timely \\nforecasting of future revenue or sales can offer a valuable insight to companies engaged in \\nmanufacture and distribution of retail goods. Short tern fore casts help with production planning \\nand stock management while long term forecasts can deal with business growth and decision \\nmaking.  \\nSales prediction can be assisted by computer systems to play the qualified managers role when \\nthey are not available. One way of implementing such a method is to try and model professional \\nmanager’s skill inside a computer program for a company to gain better results for the progress of \\ncurrent society.  \\nIn this project, we propose a predictive model using linear regression te chnique for predicting sales \\nin a supermarket. The major of this machine learning project is to build a predictive model and \\nalso search out sales of each of the products at a particular selected supermarket. Using machine \\nlearning model, supermarket predi ction tries to understand the properties of products and stores \\nwhich play a key role in increasing sales of products. Python is used as a programming language \\nand Jupyter Notebook is used as tools. To build this application, regression task aspect is used  to \\npredict sales of a given store in the future  2 \\n Various processes used are; Data Preprocessing, Feature engineering, creating model, Evaluation \\nand supervised learning helps understand the flow of data and knowing sales prices.  \\nRegression task includes data visualization, cleaning and transformation. Linear regression \\nalgorithm will be used in the proposed system  \\nThe approach of using machine learning to predict sales is accurate, simpler and flexible. Linear \\nregression model is important in tha t it can be used to understand all kinds of patterns that occur \\nin data.  \\nThe aim of developing a sales prediction system is to enable companies efficiently allocate \\nresources for future growth and manage cash flow. Also to help businesses to estimate their  cost \\nand revenue accurately based on which they are able to predict their short -term and long -term \\nperformance. The motivation for this project lies within a natural passion for market research  \\n \\n1.2: PROBLEM STATEMENT  \\nThe problem proposed in this project is sales prediction, where information about the items sold \\nand stores in which those items are exhibited will be used to predict sales that items would make \\nwhen sold in new stores.  \\nRegression is an important machine learning model for this kind of a prob lem. Predicting sales of \\na company needs time series data of the company and based on that data the model can predict \\nfuture sales of a supermarket or product.  \\nFor this kind of project of sales prediction, linear regression will be applied to evaluate the result \\nbased on training, testing and validation set of the data. The main aim of linear regression is to \\nfind the best fit line to target variable and independent variables of the data.  \\n According to Grigorios tsoumakas  [2] they used machine learning techniques to perform a survey \\non forecasting food sales. They addressed data analyst design decisions such as output variable \\nand input variable in their survey. The authors experimented by taking point of sale as internal \\ndata an d even external data by considering different environments to enhance efficiency of demand 3 \\n forecasting. They used algorithms such as boosted decision tree regression and Bayesian linear \\nregression.  \\nMost of the recent studies focused on sales modeling witho ut considering the relationship between \\ntraining and test data, they used training data directly. This causes many errors which led to a \\nreduction in accuracy.  \\nClustering techniques have been suggested to separate the entire forecasting data into several \\nclusters of predictable data before designing predictable models to minimize computational time \\nand achieve effective evaluating performance.  \\n1.3: OBJECTIVES  \\n \\n1.3.1: General Objectives  \\n \\nTo develop a model that can predict sales of products from different supermarkets  based on amount \\nused to advertise the items.  \\n \\n1.3.2: Specific Objectives  \\n \\n• To gather and analyze existing sales prediction system  \\n• To design the proposed sales prediction system  \\n• To implement the developed sales prediction system  \\n• To tes t and validate the  newly developed sales prediction system  \\n1.4: Significance of the study  \\n \\nThe proposed system aims to help supermarkets identify benchmarks and determine incremental \\nimpacts of new initiatives, plan resources in response to expected demand and project failure \\nbudgets  4 \\n 1.5: Scope of the study  \\nThe project aims at providing an efficient prediction system to the supermarkets for managing their \\ninventory . The system analyzes the sales, compares it with the past sales and predict fu ture sales.  \\nThe proposed system uses linear regression model of machine learning to make predictions of sales \\nin supermarket using python programming language  \\n \\n1.6: Limitations  \\n \\nA sales history or past records are essential for a sound forecast plan. If pa st data are not available, \\nthen the forecast is made on a guess work without a base and this may lead to failure.  \\nSince customer’s attitude may change at any time, the forecast may not be able to predict exactly \\nthe behavior of customers  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 5 \\n CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW  \\n \\n2.1: INTRODUCTION  \\nLiterature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic that provides an overview of \\ncurrent knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods and gaps in existing \\nresearch  [3]. \\nDue to importance of forecasting in many fields, many prominent approaches have been \\ndeveloped. Statistical methods, machine learning methods and hybrid models have been practiced.  \\n2.2: EXISTING SYSTEMS  \\n \\n2.2.1: Time series forecasting using Artificial Neural Networks Methodologies  \\nTime series is a general problem of great practical interest in many disciplines since it allows you \\ndiscover with some margin error, future of values of series from its past values.  \\nThe pro ject studied advances in time series forecasting models using artificial neural networks \\nmethodologies in a systematic literature review using manual search of published papers. Also it \\napplied the research methodology LSR in context of software engineerin g. The methodology \\npromotes use of systematic strategy for defining the research questions, declaring the search \\nstrategy, identifying primary studies, data synthesizing and data analysis  [4]. \\nThe objective of this LSR is to id entify the most important theoretical contributions in \\ndevelopment of neural network models for forecasting non -linear time series performed in the \\nperiod between 2006 and 2016 and also identify new research problems originated from published \\nproposal.  \\nThe search process consisted of manual search of articles published in journals serials using the \\nlargest bibliographic system called SCOPUS which includes one of the largest collections of \\nabstracts, bibliographic references and indexes. Two criteria were us ed; the first criterion was non -\\nlinear neural model for forecasting and the second on were neural networks and non -linear time \\nseries modeling using the search string.  6 \\n Although there are very high numbers of publications on ANN, there are few studies that propose \\nnew models with an appropriate theoretical support. According to Ahmed Teelab, several quality \\ncriteria were used to analyze the best ANN models that can be used in forecasting.  \\nThe research project proposed the following models for ANN;  \\nERNN -STNN - a model based on Elman recurrent networks and stochastic time effective. The \\nempirical results show that proposed neural network displays the best performance between linear \\nregression, complexity invariant distance,  multi scale complexity invariant dista nce compared to \\nback propagation neural network in financial time series forecasting  [5]. \\nApplication of novel neural network technique in financial time series forecasting, support vector \\nmachine SVM to examine the feasibility of SVM in financial time series forecasting and proposed \\nthat SVMs machines achieve an optimum network structure by implementing the structural risk \\nminimization principle which seeks to minimize an upper bound of generalization error rather th an \\nminimize the training error. SVMs have also extended to solve non - linear regression estimation \\nproblems  [6]. \\nThey also made an attempt with ensembles aiming for the improvement of prediction performance \\nand recognized ensemb les as one of the most ambitious forms for solving predictive tasks and \\nconventional in reducing the variance and bias components of forecasting seeeror by taking \\nadvantage of diversity and amid models. They compared bagging and ARIMA and positive results \\nare achieved showing that the approach can be used as an alternative for forecasting time series.  \\nFinancial time series forecasting is inevitably a center point for the practitioner for its available \\ndata and for its profitability  [7]. Ensemble algorithms are substantial in improvising performances \\nof base learners in financial time series forecasting. The research was experimented using SVR \\nsupport vector regression, BPNN back -propagation neural network, RBFNN radial basis funct ion \\nneural network, bagging for comparison and evaluation research.  \\nThe authors also experimented financial time series forecasting by using intelligent hybrid models \\nto overcome the issue of capturing the non -stationary property and identify the accurate \\nmovements. Empirical mode description and support vector regression are used to evaluate \\nperformance  7 \\n  \\nAdvantages of time series forecasting using neural networks  \\n• Neural networks have the advantage that can approximate non -linear functions  \\n• Time series analy sis allows you analyze major patterns such as trends, seasonality, \\ncyclicity and irregularity.  \\n• Neural networks are data driven  \\nDisadvantages  \\n• It was observed that original pattern of time series of the index is not stationary  \\n \\n2.2.2:  Time series sales forecasting for short shelf -life food products based on ANN and \\nevolutionary computing  \\n \\nIn retail food industry, the main cause of wasted products and stock outs is the inaccuracy of sales \\nforecasting leading to incorrect orders. More specifically in fresh  food industry, including \\nrefrigerated ones such as dairy, fruit and juice segments and the need to maintain quality in storage \\nand distribution process makes sales forecasting accuracy and important factor for planning and \\nminimizing wastage.  \\nThey present ed a framework that can be used to develop non -linear time series sales forecasting \\nmodels comprising two artificial intelligence technologies namely radial basis function neural \\nnetwork and a specially designed genetic algorithm. The methodology was appli ed successfully to \\nsales data of fresh milk provided by a major company of dairy products  [8]. \\nHybrid system of non -linear methods; genetic algorithm for variable selection and adaptive radial \\nbasis function (RBF) artificial ne twork were used to model the relationship between variables and \\nsales volume. To integrate linear and non -linear models they used ARMA for linear auto regression \\nand neural network for modeling of forecasting moving average errors.  8 \\n RBF networks are non -linear modeling structures that unveil the mathematical relationships \\nbetween the hidden node and output node. RBF has a special structure that has a certain advantages \\nincluding faster training algorithms and more successful capabilities.  \\nGenetic algorithms are machine learning procedures which derive their behavior from the process \\nof evolution in nature and are used to solve complicated optimization problems.  \\nThe combined GA -RBF method was applied on sales data of fresh milk. It selects appropriate \\nfactors that are going to be used as inputs to the models.  \\nThey obtained the following results; the problem under study is evaluation of forecasting \\nperformance of the GA -RBF methodology on the daily sales of fresh milk in area of Athens, \\nGreece and more specifica lly on 11 pack. Daily sales data of 11 pack for the first few months of \\nthe year were provided by leading manufacturer of dairy products. Effect national holidays have \\non sales were analyzed and arranged.  \\nPast sales data were also utilized in order to exp loit information they contain. Past sales data from \\ncurrent year contain the changes that have meanwhile occurred in the market and have affected the \\nlevel and trend of sales.  \\nThe change in trend could be fed into a model by providing it with percentile ch ange in sales \\nbetween the current year and previous year.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAdvantages of using the model  \\n• Accuracy in fresh food forecasting improves efficiency of order and inventory management \\nenabling retailers reduce their disposal by about 40%  \\n• Disposal detoriation i s avoided.  \\n• Minimizes lost sales due to lack of products, reducing returns due to proximity of \\nexpiration dates.  9 \\n Disadvantages of the model  \\n• GA-RBF utilizes only historical data therefore does not show how additional information \\nlike price, promotions can be  explicitly taken into account in development of the time series \\nmodel.  \\n• The type of non -linearity is not known in advance hence the model produces about 28.2% \\nof errors.  \\n• For time series forecasting to be carried out historical data for a long time period is needed \\nto capture seasonality. In this case when a new product is launched, maybe a perishable \\ngood and they have a time series for a similar product they may assume that the new \\nproduct will have a similar sales pattern.  \\n \\n2.2.3: A survey of mach ine learning techniques for food sales prediction  \\n \\nFood sales prediction is concerned with estimating future sales of companies in the food industry, \\nsuch as supermarkets, groceries, restaurants, bakeries and patisseries. Accurate short -term sales \\nprediction allows companies to minimize stocked and expired  products inside the stores at the \\nsame time.  \\nThis survey reviewed existing machine learning approaches for food sales prediction. They \\ndiscussed important design decisions of a data analyst working on food sales prediction, such as \\ntemporal granularity of  sales data, input variables to use for predicting sales and the representation \\nof sales output variable  [2]. \\nIt reviews machine learning algorithms that have been applied to food sales prediction and \\nappropriate measures for e valuating accuracy. And also discusses the challenges and opportunities \\nfor applied machine learning in the domain of food sales prediction.  \\nThe author experimented by taking point of sale as internal data and even external data by \\nconsidering different en vironments to enhance the efficiency of demand forecasting. They \\nconsidered different machine learning algorithms such as Boosted Decision Tree Regression, \\nBayesian Linear Regression and Decision Forest Regression for evaluation.  10 \\n The author had also resear ched interestingly about customers coming to the restaurants using \\nRandom Forests, k -nearest neighbor and XGBoost. They chose two real world data sets from \\ndifferent booking sites and also made different input variables from restaurant features. They found  \\nthe XGBoost is most appropriate for dataset.  \\n They had observed that regular restaurants sales are influenced by weather. They considered two \\nalgorithms; XGBoost and neural network and the results showed that XGBoost is more accurate \\nand the performance o f their system improved. To improve accuracy, they had considered \\nnumerous variables such as date characteristics, sales history and weather factors  [9]. \\nHowever the study focused on sales without considering the relationship b etween the training and \\ntesting data. They used training data directly hence causing many errors which led to reduction in \\naccuracy. Recent studies suggest clustering techniques to separate entire data into several clusters \\nof predictable data before assig ning predictable models to minimize computational time ach \\nachieve effective evaluating performance.  \\n \\n2.2.4: Sales prediction for a pharmaceutical distribution company: A data mining based \\napproach  \\n \\nFor pharmaceutical distribution companies it is essential  to obtain good estimates of medicine \\nneeds, due to short shelf life of many medicines and the need to control stock levels so as to avoid \\nexcessive inventory costs while guaranteeing customer demand satisfaction and thus decreasing \\nthe possibility of loss  of customers due to stock shortage.  \\nThey explored the use of time series data mining technique for sales prediction of individual \\nproducts of pharmaceutical distribution company in Portugal  [10]. \\nThrough data mining techniques , the historical data of product sales are analyzed to detect patterns \\nto make prediction based on the experience contained in the data.  \\nThe results they obtained with the technique as well with proposed method suggested that the \\nperformed modeling maybe c onsidered appropriate for the short term product sales prediction.  11 \\n They  examined the role of data prescription and pharmacies sales mining in pharmaceutical \\nindustry and various type of techniques that be used.  \\n They found that most Pharmaceutical distribution companies (PDC) in Portugal still use heuristic \\nor simple statisti cal models for their sales forecasting. With the access to past sales data and by \\nuse of data mining techniques, almost all companies and especially pharmaceuticals distribution \\ncenters can make accurate and reliable prediction for future sales. Since sale s prediction should be \\nperformed with high accuracy and in short time, it is impossible to do it with manual or traditional \\nmethods. Data mining techniques enhance accuracy and speed up the process.  \\nThey collected the required data from a large PDC that di spenses medicine to customers in a \\nnumber of provinces in Iran. After receiving the orders the company is committed to supplying \\ndrugs to provinces within 24hours, cities within 48hours and remotes areas within 72 hours. In \\nkeeping with its market leading position, this company needs to have large product inventories in \\norder to meet customers demand, as a shortage of drugs is not acceptable.  \\nThe company keeps inventories for about 2months. This fact causes many excessive costs and \\ninvestments for Iranian P DCs. Thus this gap causes undesired expenses, monthly and precise sales \\nprediction would shorten or even eliminate the gap.  \\nAccording to restrictions on sales of medicines such as existing new items with short numbers of \\npast sales records and having a gre at diversity of medicines their objective was concerned with \\ndevelopment of a novel and accurate sales forecasting method for pharmaceutical products by \\nmeans of one of the related data mining approaches to overcome the problem of having numerous \\nkinds of medicine and not having enough past sales records of each medicine.  \\nTo predict sales of company, past sales records were collected. The company provided the sales \\ndata of nearly 1200 kinds of medicine which were sold to different provinces or centers in Ir an \\nduring three years. Database of the company included name, code of medicines, sales number, \\nname and code of centers, name of manufacturers and price and monthly date of sales.  \\nTo approach their objective, code, date and number of products sold were sel ected from the \\ndatabase. Three -year monthly sales data were gathered and  from PDC , in preprocessing phase \\nraw data was prepared to suit the research objectives, exploratory analysis was performed to 12 \\n specify nature of data and also a comprehensive graph b ased analysis was performed to find clique \\nsets and group members and visualize the network of drugs.  \\nSales forecasting models were built in 3 different approaches;  \\n• ARIMA methodology for time series forecasting  \\n• Hybrid neural network approach for forecasting by means of each drugs past records  \\n• Hybrid neural network for time  \\nTheir research verified that by applying data mining approaches forecasting performance can be \\nconsiderably improved since the approach captured different patterns in data.  \\nDisadvantages of Data Mining Approach in prediction  \\nData mining is not perfectly accurate. Therefore if inaccurate information is used in prediction it \\nwill cause serious consequences.  \\nData mining may violate user privacy.

Its high level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic \\nbinding makes it very attractive for Rapid application Development, as well as for use as a scripting \\nor glue language to connect  existing components together  [11] \\nPython libraries include;  \\nPandas  \\nIt’s an open source python package used for data science and machine learning tasks.

Methodology  allows one to critically evaluate study’s overall validity \\nand reliability  [15]. \\nIt discusses how data is collected or generated, and how data is analyzed. I obtained data from both \\nprimary and secondary sources. Pr imary sources were more reliable and enabled me have \\nconfidence on decision making.  \\n3.2: Data Collection Techniques  \\n \\n3.2.1: Interview  \\n  \\nInterview is a qualitative research technique which involves asking open -ended questions to \\nconverse with respondents an d collect elicit data about a subject  [16]. \\nType of interviews include;  \\nPersonal interview where questions are asked personally directly to the respondent  it gives a higher \\nresponse rate  \\nTelephonic interviews are widely used and easy to combine with online surveys to carry out \\nresearch effectively.  \\nEmail or web -page interview; since online research is growing and more consumers are migrating \\nto more virtual world e -mail and web -page interviews are efficient  [16]. \\nAdvantages of using Interviews  \\n• I was able  to gain valuable insights based on the depth of the information gathered and the \\nwisdom.  16 \\n • Interviews require only simple equipment and build on conversation skills which \\nresearchers already have.  \\n• Interviews are more flexible  \\n• Direct contact at the point of interview means data can be checked for accuracy and \\nrelevance are they are collected  \\n \\nDisadvantages of using interviews  \\n• Data analysis and preparation can be difficult and time consu ming.  \\n• Consistency and objectivity are hard to achieve  \\n• Identity of researcher may affect the statements of the interviewee  \\n• Some people may not show up for the interview  \\n \\n3.2.2: Questionnaires  \\n \\nQuestionnaire is the main instrument for collecting data in sur vey research. It’s a set of \\nstandardized questions, often called items, which follow a fixed scheme in order to collect \\nindividual data about one or more specific topics  [17]. \\nI have used b oth open -ended and closed -ended questions.  \\nAdvantages  \\n• Result into wide range of views from customers  \\n• Questionnaires are the most affordable ways to gather quantitative data.  \\n• It’s easy and quick to collect results  \\n• When data has been quantified it can be used to compare and contrast other research and \\nmaybe used to measure change.  \\nDisadvantages  17 \\n • There is a chance that some questions will be ignored and left unanswered  \\n• Differences in understanding and interpretation  \\n• Questionnaire cannot fully capture emotional responses and fee lings  \\n3.2.3: Observation  \\nIt’s a technique that involves systematically selecting, watching, listening, reading, touching and \\nrecording behavior and characteristics of living beings, objects or phenomena [18]. \\nAdvantages  \\n• Data can be collected at the time they occur  \\n• Observation study describe  observed phenomena as they occur in natural setting  \\n• Offers an opportunity for longitudinal analysis  \\nDisadvantages  \\n• Difficulties in quantification  \\n• Sample size observed is us ually small  \\n• There is no opportunity to study the past when using observation method  \\n3.2.4: Documents and records  \\nIt’s examining existing data from databases, reports and financial records that relate to your area \\nof research  [19]. \\nSome companies still record their sales history in books. Therefore I obtained from their sales \\nrecords. The records contained sales for every month of the year.  \\nThe data obtained was useful to predict the sales of the next year for the company  \\nAdvantages of using Documents and Records  \\n• Easy to obtain historical data  \\n• It’s an inexpensive way to gather information  \\n• Document and record study offers an opportunity for longitudinal analysis.  18 \\n 3.2.5: Justification  \\n \\nSince data collection is essential in research, to gather information in the proposed system two \\nmethods will be used; interviews and use of documents and records.  \\nInterviewing specific persons in supermarket will enable one obtain information such as how much \\nsales they make week ly, quarterly and monthly, factors affecting increase and low sales and also \\nhow prediction system may help utilize resources if implemented.  \\nThrough interviews one is exposed to first -hand information  and also helps in gaining more \\ninsights into current s ystems  \\nSince prediction system involves use of historical data to obtain  \\n \\n3.3: Software Development Techniques  \\n \\n3.3.1: Waterfall Methodology  \\n \\nWaterfall model is a linear application development that uses rigid phases: when one phase ends, \\nnext begins. Steps occur in sequence, and if unmodified, the model does not allow developers to \\ngo back to previous steps  [20] \\nIt’s also  referred as linear -sequential lifecycle model  [21]. It follows a s tructured sequential path \\nfrom requirements  to maintenance, setting out milestones at each steps before next step begins  \\n[21].  \\n 19 \\n  Figure 2: Waterfall model  \\n  [21] \\nAdvantages of Waterfall Model  \\n• Waterfall model divides the entire process of software development into finite \\nindependent stages making controlling of each stage easier.  \\n• Requirements are stable and known to the developer at the starting point of the project  \\n• Only one stage is processed at a time thus avoiding confusion  \\n• It’s simple and easy to implement   [22] \\nDisadvantages of Waterfall Model  \\n• It’s difficult to implement in complex projec t \\n• It’s difficult to state all requirements explicitly at the starting which causes natural \\nuncertainty at the beginning of the project  \\n• A strict waterfall model doesn’t allow going back once the stage is completed.  [22] \\n \\n3.3.2: Rapid Application Development Methodology  \\n \\nRAD is an agile software development approach that focuses more on ongoing software projects \\nand user feedback and less on following a strict plan  [23]. \\nRAD develops software via the u se of prototypes,  dummy, backend databases and its goal is to  \\nmeet the business need of the system and customer is heavily involved in the process  [24]. \\nIt consists of four phases [25];   \\nRequirement analysis - Developers, clients and team members communicate to determine the \\ngoals and expectations for the project  \\nUser Design - involves building out user design through various prototype iterations  \\n20 \\n Rapid construction - Takes the prototypes and beta systems from design phase and converts them \\ninto a working model.  \\nCutover – implementation phase where finished product is launched  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n [26] \\nFigure 3: Rapid application Methodology  \\nAdvantages  of using RAD Methodology  \\n• RAD lets you break the project into smaller and more manageable tasks  \\n• Task oriented structure allows project managers to optimize their team’s efficiency by \\nassigning tasks according to members specialist and experience.  \\n• Clients get a working product delivered in a shorter time frame  \\n• Regular communication and constant feedback between team members and stakeholders \\nincreases the efficiency of design and build process  \\nDisadvantages of RAD  \\n• Needs strong team collaboration  \\n• Needs highly skilled developers  \\n• Only suitable for projects which have a small development time  \\n21 \\n • Only systems which can be modularized can be developed using RAD  \\n \\n3.3.3: Agile Methodology  \\n \\nAgile methodology is a type of project management process,  mainly used for software \\ndevelopment, where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self -\\norganizing and cross -functional teams and their customers  [27]. \\nIt is used to deliver complex projects due to it s adaptiveness. It emphasizes on collaboration, \\nflexibility, continuous improvement and high quality results.  \\nThe five phases are;  \\nProject initiation which is about discussing project vision and ROI justification. Team members, \\ntime and work resources requ ired are determined.  \\nPlanning - it is where the team gets together with their sponsor or product owner and identifies \\nexactly what they are looking for.  \\nDevelopment –once requirements have been defined actual work begins  \\nProduction –a handover with relevant  training should take place between the production and \\nsupport teams  \\nRetirement – it is the final stage. Customers are notified and informed about migration to newer \\nreleases or alternative options  \\n \\nFigure 4: Agile methodology  \\nFig 3 [28] \\n22 \\n  \\nIt has several frameworks such as;  \\nScrum  used to implement the ideas behind agile software development  \\nKanban is a visual method used to paint picture of the workflow process, with an aim to identify \\nany bottlenecks early in the process  \\nFDD - Is a lightweight iterative and incremental software development process with an objective \\nto deliver tangible, working software in timely manner.  \\nAgile methodology has the following benefits  [29]; \\n• Better product quality - agile methods have excellent safeguards to make sure that quality \\nis as high as possible  \\n• Higher customer satisfaction - by keeping customers involved and engaged.  \\n• High team morale -being part of self -managing team  allows people to be creative, \\ninnovative and acknowledged for their expertise.  \\n• Increased collaboration and ownership - development team, product owner and scrum \\nmaster work closely together on a daily basis  \\n3.3.4: Justification  \\nIn this project I have used both agile methodology and waterfall methodology because;  \\nAgile methodology is suitable for projects which comprise multiple iterations of understanding a \\nbusiness problem by asking questions, data acquisition from multiple sources, data cleaning, \\nfeature engineering and modelling.  \\nWaterfall m ethodology is easy to implement  and doesn’t need a lot of resources and effort  \\n \\n3.4: System Requirements  \\n3.4.1: Software Requirements  \\n• OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows 10 and higher version, Linux or MacOS  \\n• PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: Python  \\n3.4.2: Hardware Requirements  \\n• PROCESSOR: Intel Core I 7 and above  \\n• RAM: minimum of 16gb  \\n• Laptop  \\n• Printer  23 \\n 3.4.3: Functional Requirements  \\nAre function or features that must include in any system to satisfy the business needs and be \\nacceptable to the users. The developed system has the following functional requirements;  \\n• The system is able to generate and approximate sales  \\n• The system can collect accurate data from supermarket database in a consistent manner  \\n• Database is updated by the l atest values  \\n3.4.4: Non -Functional Requirements  \\nIt’s a description of features, characteristics and attributes of the system as well as any constraints \\nthat may limit the boundaries of the proposed system. They are based on performance, information, \\ncontro l and security efficiency and services. Based on the developed  system , non-functional \\nrequirements include;  \\n• The system provide s better accuracy  \\n• The system has a  simple interface for users to use.  \\n• Perform efficiently in short amount of time . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 24 \\n 3.5: Conclusion  \\nSales forecasting plays a vital role in the business sector in every field. With the help of the sales \\nforecasts, sales revenue analysis will help to get the details needed to estimate both revenue and \\nthe income. Linear regression has be en evaluated on supermarket sales to find critical factors that \\ninfluence sales to provide a solution for forecasting sales.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 25 \\n Chapter 4: System design, Implementation and Testing.  \\n4.1: Introduction.  \\nSystem design is the  process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, \\ninterfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements  [30]. \\n4.2: System design.  \\nThe proposed system is intended to build a model which predicts monthly sales based on the \\nmoney spent on different platforms for marketing in a supermarket.  \\nTo develop the proposed system the following process of defining the architecture will be \\nfollowed.  \\nThis process is iterative in nature as it trains the model to get the best-suited information for \\nbusiness purposes in this case to predict the amount sales based on money spent.  \\n4.2.1: Logical Design  \\nThe logical design of a system pertains to an abstract representation of the data flows, inputs and \\noutputs of the system  [31]. This is often conducted via modelling, using an over -abstract (and \\nsometimes graphical) model of the actual system.  \\nFigure 5 Use Case Model  \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\n 4.2.2:  User Interface Design.  \\nUser interface design is the  visual layout of the elements that a user might interact with in a \\nsystem.  \\nSales prediction model will have the following layout where the user can enter amount spent to \\nadvertise on TV, Radio and Newspapers so as to predict future sales.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 6 User Interface Design  27 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n4.2.3:  Data Design.  \\nData design is concerned with how the data is represented and stored within the system.  \\nThe dataset used in the model is in tabular form and is stored in database as follows.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 7 Data Design  \\n28 \\n  \\n4.2.4:  Process Design.  \\n Process Design is concerned with how data moves through the system, and with how and where \\nit is validated, secured and/or transformed as it flows into, through and out of the system.   \\nTo develop the proposed system the following process of defining the architecture will be \\nfollowed.  \\n \\nFigure 8 Process Design  \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n  \\n \\nData Collection and Cleaning.  \\nIn the proposed system we will use the advertising dataset given in ISLR and analyze the \\nrelationship between TV, Radio and Newspaper and sales using multiple regression model.  \\nOnce the data has been collected it is cleaned .Data cleaning is the process of  fixing or removing \\nincorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.   \\n  \\nFeature Engineering.  \\nFeature engineering is the  process of using domain knowledge to extract \\nfeatures  (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data. In our proposed system, the \\nuseful features are; TV, Radio, Newspaper and sales.  \\nIn order to test a feature’s usefulness, we will proceed to split the data, create some models, and \\ncheck its efficie ncy by setting the values for independent (X) variable and dependent \\n(Y)variable.  X= dataset [[\\'TV\\', \\'Radio\\', \\'Newspaper\\']]  \\ny = dataset [\\'Sales\\']  \\n \\nSplit Train/Test  \\nOnce the useful features have been identified, we must split our dataset into a Train and Test \\ndataset.  \\nIn the proposed system, we will train the model into the Train dataset and test it in the Test \\ndataset.  \\nThe split can be done taking 70% and 30% of th e data for train and test respectively.  \\nAs shown;  \\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  30 \\n X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 100)  \\n \\n \\n \\nModel Tuning.  \\nThe proposed model uses Multiple Linear r egression algorithm to predict the sales.  \\nMultiple linear regression  (MLR) algorithm is used to estimate the relationship between  two or \\nmore independent variables  and one dependent variable . \\nAdvantages of Regression Analysis algorithm.  \\nSimple implementation  \\nLinear Regression is a very simple algorithm that can be implemented very easily to give \\nsatisfactory results.  \\nPerformance on linearly separable datasets  \\nLinear regression fits linearly separable datasets almost perfectly and is often used t o find the \\nnature of the relationship between variables.  \\nOverfitting can be reduced by regularization  \\nOverfitting  is a situation that arises when a machine learning model fits a dataset very closely \\nand hence captures the  noisy data  as well.  \\nRegularization  is a technique that can be easily implemented and is capable of effectively \\nreducing the complexity of a function so as to reduce the risk of overfitting.  \\n \\nEvaluation of the Model.  \\nModel evaluation aims  to estimate the generalization accurac y of a model  on future \\n(unseen/out -of-sample) data.  \\nThe proposed model will use the following evaluation metrics to measure how good a model \\nperforms and how well it approximates the relationship.  31 \\n Mean Squared Error (MSE)  \\nIt is the most common metric for r egression tasks. It has a convex shape. It is the average of the \\nsquared difference between the predicted and actual value.  \\nMean Absolute Error (MAE)  \\nThis is simply the average of the absolute difference between the target value and the value \\npredicted by the model.   \\nR-squared or Coefficient of Determination  \\nThis metric represents the part of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the \\nindependent variables of the model. It measures the strength of the relationship between your \\nmodel and the dep endent variable.  \\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  \\nThis is the square root of the average of the squared difference of the predicted and actual value.  \\nFinal Model  \\n \\nThe last step the proposed system will undergo is getting the final model. Once we have obtained \\nthe best tuning for a model, we train that model into the full dataset (Train andTest) in order to \\ntrain the model with all the available data.  \\nFinally, the model is prepared to predict future sales, so we can introduce future sales and start \\nshow ing the predictions.  \\n \\nThe purpose of the System Design process is  to provide sufficient detailed data and \\ninformation about the system and its system elements to enable the implementation \\nconsistent with architectural entities as defined in models  and view s of the system \\narchitecture.  32 \\n Using the proposed system design we will be able to implement the stated steps to come up \\nwith our model.  \\n \\n4.3: Implementation Approaches  \\nIn order to successfully achieve our intended goal of developing a model for predicting sales, we \\nneed to have and implementation plan.  \\nImplementation plan is designed to document,  in detail, the critical steps necessary to put your \\nsolutions into practice . \\nTo implement the steps identified in proposed system design the following approaches have \\nbeen used.  \\n4.3.1: Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm.  \\nMultiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical \\ntechnique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response vari able \\n[32]. \\nThe main goal of regression is the construction of an efficient model to predict the total sales \\nfrom a bunch of attribute variables that is money spent to advertise TV sales, Radio sales and \\nNewspaper sales.  \\nMultiple linear regression algorithm functions as follows;  33 \\n  \\n \\n \\n4.3.2: Flask framework.  \\nTo develop and implement the user interface design the model uses flask framework for frontend \\ndesign.  \\nFlask is a micro  web framework written in python  [33]  \\n4.4 Coding Details and Code Efficiency.  \\n \\nImporting necessary packages and reading the dataset  \\nimport pandas as pd  \\nimport numpy as np  \\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  \\nimport seaborn as sns  \\n \\nnumpy : NumPy  stands  for numeric  Python,  a python  package  for the computation  and processin\\ng of the multi -dimensional  and single -dimensional  array  elements.  \\n34 \\n  \\npandas : Pandas  provide  high-performance  data manipulation  in Python.  \\n \\nmatplotlib : Matplotlib  is a librar y used for data visualization.  It is mainly  used for basic  plotting.\\n Visualization  using  Matplotlib  generally  consists  of bars,  pies, lines,  scatter  plots,  and so on. \\n \\nseaborn : Seaborn  is a library  used for making  statistical  graphics  of the dataset.  It provides  a var\\niety of visualization  patterns.  It uses fewer  syntax  and has easily  interesting  default  themes.

catch bugs that are visible only during runtime.  39 \\n The purpose of machine learning testing is to ensure that this learned logic will remain \\nconsistent, no matter how many times we call the program.  \\nFunctional Testing  \\nIt is a type of software testing that validates the software system against the functional \\nrequirements/specifications.   \\nThe purpose of Functional tests is to test each function of the software application, by providing \\nappropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.  \\n \\nFigure 9 Functional Testing  \\n \\n \\nFunctional testing mainly involves;  \\nBlack -box testing  of machine learning (ML) models refers to testing with no knowledge about \\nthe internal details of the model, such as the algorithm used to create it and the features in it. The \\nmain objective of black -box testing is to ensure the quality of the models in a sustained manner.  \\nUnit tests . The program is broken down into blocks, and each element (unit) is tested separately  \\nIt involves  testing  individual units of the source code, such as functions, methods, and class \\nto ascertain that they meet the requirements  and have expected results.  \\nEach piece of code has been tested individually and results executed.  \\nRegression tests . They cover already tested software to see if it doesn’t suddenly break and also \\nensures quality of the user experience along with the new changes.     \\n40 \\n  Integration tests  \\nThese tests aim to determine whether modules that have been developed separately work as \\nexpected when brought together. In terms of a data pipeline, these can check that:  \\n• The data cleaning process results in a dataset appropriate for the model  \\n• The model training can handle the data provided to it and outputs results (ensuring that \\ncode can be refactored in the future)  \\n• The data is consumable by the model (a label exists for every input, the types of the data \\nare accepted  by the type of model chosen)  \\n• We are able to refactor our code in the future, without breaking the end to end \\nfunctionality.  \\n \\n \\n4.6.

Conclusion  \\n \\n \\nSales forecasting is a pivotal part of the financial planning of business for any organization. It \\ncan be said as a self -assessment tool which uses the statistics of the past and the current sales in \\norder to predict future performance.  \\n Sales forecasting plays an important role in optimizing the supermarket sales process. Financial \\nand Sales planning with the help of the sales forecasts helps to get the information needed to \\npredict t he revenue as well as the profit.  \\nThus, in finding such solution for sales forecasts Linear Regression algorithm have been \\nevaluated on sales data which can forecast the short term sales and help the organization in \\nmaking the key decisions. After perform ing the various statistical tests and performance metrics, \\nit is found that Linear Regression is a suitable algorithm in accordance to the chosen dataset and \\nthus accomplishing the aim of this project.  \\n6.2: Future Works  \\n \\nIn future work one can attempt perf ormance metrics such as time while predicting the sales. \\nThese metrics can play a crucial role in evaluating multiple Machine Learning algorithms.  \\nAnd also one can attempt to implement more accurate data in the continued study. Machine \\nLearning has the adv antage of analyzing data and key variables so that you can aim to develop a \\nsystematic approach using a variety of Machine Learning techniques.  \\n \\n \\n \\nAPPENDICES  50 \\n APP 1: Budget  \\nTable 1: Budget  \\n \\nITEM  QUANTITY  UNIT PRICE  TOTAL(Ksh)  \\nPrinting and binding   5000  5000  \\nLaptop  1 40000  40000  \\nSoftware  3 40000  120000  \\nInternet   6000  6000  \\nMiscellaneous   15000  15000  \\nTOTAL (ksh)    186,000  \\n \\nTable 2: Schedule  \\n \\nAPP2: Schedule  \\nACTIVITY  MARCH  APRIL  MAY  JUNE  JULY  AUGUST  SEPTEMBER  \\nProject \\nidentification         \\nSystem \\nanalysis         \\nSystem Design         \\nCoding and \\nTesting         \\nImplementation         \\nDocumentation         \\nProject \\nsubmission         \\n \\n 51 \\n  \\n \\nReferences  \\n \\n[1]  K.
