    "A computer language typically consists of the following six components.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Syntax__: The syntax of a language defines the rules and structure for writing valid programs. It includes the arrangement of keywords, punctuation, and other symbols that form the building blocks of code. Syntax rules enforce proper program structure and guide the interpretation of instructions by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Variables and Data Types__: Computer languages support the declaration and manipulation of variables, which are used to store and represent data. Data types define the kind of values that variables can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, or more complex structures like arrays and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Control Structures__: Control structures provide mechanisms for controlling the flow of program execution. They allow programmers to conditionally execute blocks of code, iterate over a set of instructions, or define branching paths based on certain conditions. Common control structures include if-else statements, loops (e.g., for, while), and switch statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Functions and Procedures__: Functions and procedures allow programmers to encapsulate reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They promote modularity and code reusability, enabling the creation of complex programs by breaking them down into smaller, manageable units.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Libraries and Frameworks__: Many computer languages provide libraries and frameworks, which are pre-written code modules or collections of functions that extend the language's capabilities. These libraries can be leveraged to access additional functionality, such as mathematical operations, database connectivity, graphical user interfaces, or machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Debugging and Error Handling__: Computer languages often offer features for debugging and error handling, allowing programmers to identify and fix issues in their code. These features include error messages, exception handling mechanisms, and debugging tools to track program execution and detect logical or runtime errors."

    "1. __High-level languages__ are designed to be human-readable and provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying hardware. They are closer to natural languages and allow programmers to write code that is easier to understand and maintain. High-level languages are portable and platform-independent, meaning that they can be executed on different hardware and operating systems without any modifications. Examples of high-level languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Low-level languages__ are designed to be machine-readable and provide a low level of abstraction from the underlying hardware. They are closer to the binary language of computers and allow programmers to write code that is more efficient and performant. Low-level languages are not portable and are specific to a particular hardware architecture or operating system. Examples of low-level languages include assembly language and machine code."
