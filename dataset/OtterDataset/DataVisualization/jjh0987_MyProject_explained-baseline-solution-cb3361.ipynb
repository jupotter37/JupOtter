    "This code will do data transformations and loading data from input directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `dt_transforms = [...]`: This defines a list called `dt_transforms` that will contain a series of transformations to be applied to a timestamp column in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `pl.col('timestamp').str.to_datetime()`: This line converts a column named 'timestamp' to datetime format using the `str.to_datetime()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `(pl.col('timestamp').str.to_datetime().dt.year() - 2000).cast(pl.UInt8).alias('year')`: This line extracts the year from the 'timestamp' column, subtracts 2000 from it, casts the result as an 8-bit unsigned integer, and assigns it an alias 'year'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `pl.col('timestamp').str.to_datetime().dt.month().cast(pl.UInt8).alias('month')`: Similar to line 3, this line extracts the month from the 'timestamp' column, casts it as an 8-bit unsigned integer, and assigns it an alias 'month'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `pl.col('timestamp').str.to_datetime().dt.day().cast(pl.UInt8).alias('day')`: This line extracts the day from the 'timestamp' column, casts it as an 8-bit unsigned integer, and assigns it an alias 'day'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `pl.col('timestamp').str.to_datetime().dt.hour().cast(pl.UInt8).alias('hour')`: Similar to lines 3 and 4, this line extracts the hour from the 'timestamp' column, casts it as an 8-bit unsigned integer, and assigns it an alias 'hour'.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `data_transforms = [...]`: This defines another list called `data_transforms` that will contain transformations for columns other than the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `pl.col('anglez').cast(pl.Int16)`: This line casts the column 'anglez' to a 16-bit signed integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `(pl.col('enmo') * 1000).cast(pl.UInt16)`: This line multiplies the 'enmo' column by 1000 and casts the result as a 16-bit unsigned integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `train_series = pl.scan_parquet('/kaggle/input/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/train_series.parquet').with_columns(dt_transforms + data_transforms)`: This line reads a parquet file ('train_series.parquet'), applies the transformations defined in `dt_transforms` and `data_transforms`, and assigns the result to the `train_series` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `train_events = pl.read_csv('/kaggle/input/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/train_events.csv').with_columns(dt_transforms)`: This line reads a CSV file ('train_events.csv'), applies the transformations defined in `dt_transforms`, and assigns the result to the `train_events` variable.\n",

    "12. `test_series = pl.scan_parquet('/kaggle/input/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/test_series.parquet').with_columns(dt_transforms + data_transforms)`: Similar to line 10, this line reads a parquet file ('test_series.parquet'), applies the transformations defined in `dt_transforms` and `data_transforms`, and assigns the result to the `test_series` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. `series_ids = train_events['series_id'].unique(maintain_order=True).to_list()`: This line extracts unique 'series_id' values from the `train_events` DataFrame while maintaining the original order and converts them to a Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. `onset_counts = ...`: These lines calculate the counts of 'onset' events and 'wakeup' events for each 'series_id' and store them in `onset_counts` and `wakeup_counts` DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. `counts = pl.DataFrame(...)`: This line creates a DataFrame called `counts` containing 'series_id', 'onset_counts', and 'wakeup_counts' columns by combining the results of the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. `count_mismatches = counts.filter(...)`: This line filters `counts` to find series where the 'onset_counts' do not match 'wakeup_counts'.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. `train_series = train_series.filter(...)` and `train_events = train_events.filter(...)`: These lines filter the `train_series` and `train_events` DataFrames to exclude series with count mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. `series_ids = train_events.drop_nulls()['series_id'].unique(maintain_order=True).to_list()`: This line updates the `series_ids` list by removing rows with null values in 'series_id' and extracting unique values while maintaining the original order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code loads and transforms data from different sources, applies various data transformations, and filters out series with count mismatches in 'onset' and 'wakeup' events."

    "\n",
    "2. `for mins in [5, 30, 60*2, 60*8]:`: This is the beginning of a loop that iterates over different time window durations specified in minutes (5, 30, 120, and 480).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `features += [...]`: This line appends new features to the `features` list. For each time window duration (`mins`), it calculates the following features for the 'enmo' column:\n",
    "   - Rolling mean with a window of 12 times the specified minutes (`12 * mins`) using `pl.col('enmo').rolling_mean(...)`.\n",
    "   - Rolling maximum with the same window using `pl.col('enmo').rolling_max(...)`.\n",
    "   It then casts these features to 16-bit unsigned integers and assigns aliases with the format 'enmo_Xm_mean' and 'enmo_Xm_max', where X is the time window duration in minutes.\n",

    "5. The same steps are repeated for the 'anglez' column, resulting in features named 'anglez_Xm_mean' and 'anglez_Xm_max' for each time window duration.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. `train_series = train_series.with_columns(features).select(id_cols + feature_cols)`: This line adds the calculated features to the `train_series` DataFrame using the `with_columns` method and then selects only the columns specified in `id_cols` and `feature_cols`. This effectively updates `train_series` with the newly generated features.\n",

It then updates the `train_series` and `test_series` DataFrames with these calculated features while keeping the specified identifier and feature columns. This process is common in feature engineering for machine learning tasks, where additional features are created from existing data to improve model performance."

    "\n",
    "This Python function, `make_train_dataset`, is designed to create a training dataset from raw data, which includes both feature data (`train_data`) and event information (`train_events`). It returns feature data `X` and target labels `y` for training our machine learning model.:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `series_ids = train_data['series_id'].unique(maintain_order=True).to_list()`: This line extracts unique 'series_id' values from the `train_data` DataFrame while maintaining the original order and converts them to a Python list. These unique series identifiers will be used to process data for each individual series.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `X, y = pl.DataFrame(), pl.DataFrame()`: This line initializes two empty DataFrames, `X` for features and `y` for target labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for idx in tqdm(series_ids):`: This loop iterates through each unique 'series_id' in the `series_ids` list, using `tqdm` to display a progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `sample = train_data.filter(...)`: Within the loop, this line filters the `train_data` DataFrame to obtain the data for the current 'series_id'. It then normalizes the selected columns (except 'hour') by dividing each column by its standard deviation and casting the result as a 32-bit floating-point number (Float32).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `events = train_events.filter(...)`: This line filters the `train_events` DataFrame to obtain the events data for the current 'series_id'.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `if drop_nulls: ...`: If the `drop_nulls` parameter is set to `True`, this section removes data points in the `sample` DataFrame that correspond to dates where no events were recorded. It does this by filtering the `sample` DataFrame based on matching dates between `sample` and `events` using the 'timestamp' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `X = X.vstack(...)`: This line vertically stacks the current 'sample' DataFrame onto the existing 'X' DataFrame, combining the features for multiple series.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `onsets = events.filter(...)`: This line extracts the 'step' values corresponding to 'onset' events from the 'events' DataFrame and stores them in the `onsets` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `wakeups = events.filter(...)`: Similar to the previous line, this extracts the 'step' values corresponding to 'wakeup' events and stores them in the `wakeups` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. `y = y.vstack(...)`: This line constructs target labels ('asleep') based on the 'onsets' and 'wakeups' values. It checks for each data point in 'sample' if it falls within any sleep interval defined by 'onset' and 'wakeup' events, and casts the result as a Boolean value. The resulting labels are stacked vertically onto the 'y' DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. `y = y.to_numpy().ravel()`: After processing all series, this line converts the 'y' DataFrame to a NumPy array and flattens it to a 1D array. This is typically done to match the format expected by many machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Finally, the function returns `X` (the feature matrix) and `y` (the target labels) as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes raw feature data and event information, processes them for each series, and creates a dataset suitable for training machine learning models. It provides a way to drop null data points if desired and generates target labels based on sleep event information."

    "\n",
    "This Python function, `get_events`, is designed to generate sleep event predictions and format them as a submission DataFrame. It takes a time series dataset (`series`) with features and a trained classifier (`classifier`) for predicting sleep events. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `series_ids = series['series_id'].unique(maintain_order=True).to_list()`: This line extracts unique 'series_id' values from the `series` DataFrame while maintaining the original order and converts them to a Python list. These unique series identifiers will be used to process data for each individual series.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `events = pl.DataFrame(...)`: This line initializes an empty DataFrame called `events` with a specific schema containing columns: 'series_id' (string), 'step' (integer), 'event' (string), and 'score' (float). This DataFrame will store sleep event predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `for idx in tqdm(series_ids):`: This loop iterates through each unique 'series_id' in the `series_ids` list, using `tqdm` to display a progress bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `scale_cols = [...]`: This line identifies the columns in the `feature_cols` list (excluding 'hour') that have a standard deviation not equal to zero. These columns will be used for feature scaling later.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `X = series.filter(...)`: Within the loop, this line filters the `series` DataFrame to obtain data for the current 'series_id'. It selects the columns specified in `id_cols` and `feature_cols`. The selected columns are then normalized by dividing them by their standard deviation and casting the result as a 32-bit floating-point number (Float32).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `preds, probs = ...`: This line applies the trained classifier (`classifier`) to predict sleep events and obtain corresponding probabilities for each data point in the 'X' DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `X = X.with_columns(...)`: This code adds two new columns to the 'X' DataFrame:\n",
    "   - 'prediction': It contains the integer predictions (0 or 1) for sleep events.\n",
    "   - 'probability': It contains the predicted probabilities of being in a sleep state.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `pred_onsets = X.filter(...)`, `pred_wakeups = X.filter(...)`: These lines extract predicted 'onset' and 'wakeup' time steps based on changes in the 'prediction' column. These steps are converted to Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `if len(pred_onsets) > 0: ...`: This conditional block checks if there are any predicted sleep events ('onset' and 'wakeup' pairs). If there are, it proceeds to process and filter these events.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Inside the conditional block, it ensures that predicted sleep periods have a minimum duration of 30 minutes (12 * 30 time steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. It calculates a 'score' for each sleep period by taking the mean probability over that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. It then adds sleep events to the `events` DataFrame, including 'onset' and 'wakeup' events, along with their corresponding 'score'.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The loop continues to process each series, accumulating sleep events in the `events` DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. After processing all series, it converts the `events` DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame, resets the index, and renames the index column to 'row_id'.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Finally, the function returns the formatted sleep events as a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function takes a time series dataset and a trained classifier, predicts sleep events, filters and processes them, and returns the results as a Pandas DataFrame suitable for submission or further analysis."
