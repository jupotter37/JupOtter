More than enough to kickstart your Python development career. My first idea was to also add a series of examples to this series. The examples would include data visualization, working with matrices, the amazing Pandas library, and some Scikit-Learn topics. While, I will probably still create those articles, they will be published in a separate series a bit later this year. Feel free to contact me for requests or suggestions."

And to prove the point that you can do everything in Python, we will create a nice certificate ourselves! It would be great if you actually posted this on your LinkedIn and please do not forget to tag me. I would definitely congratulate you on your achievement! Alright, lets create our Pythonic certificate in the most Python way possible! First we need three libraries: matplotlib and pillow for working with images and wget for downloading the required fonts."

    "This is a long piece of code, but it does create a full-blown certificate with all the bells and whistles one would expect. We first import three parts of pillow, which is abbreviated as PIL: Image, ImageDraw, and ImageFont. The first holds the image, the second adds many draw funtions, and the last adds text drawing. Another thing that is new is the magic-option %matplotlib inline which makes sure that we plot right into the Notebook. The function itself makes use of the drawing functionality of pillow. We add a double-lined border, and some rectangles on the top and bottom. Next we add centered text in two different fonts. To make it official, I have the current date and my signature added at the bottom. We can call the function we the name who has earned the certificate and it will write the image and also plots it onto the screen. It should look like this:"

    "[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices in Python. Without Numpy, we would probably create a list, which would work perfectly fine. Numpy trades the flexibility of having any object in the list for having fixed types, generally numbers, as an array, and has blazingly fast compiled code to process them. Numpy is tremendously faster than vanilla Python. But as with regular Python, it takes a bit of time to learn the concepts. Pablo Carares has made [an amazing guide](https://pabloinsente.github.io/intro-numpy-fundamentals) for Numpy and highly recommend that you start there."

    "If you got an idea on how Numpy works (you don't have to be a Numpy master), the next step is definitely [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Personally, I am a huge fan of Pandas! It offers a kind of language to talk to your data. Getting fluent in Pandas has many benefits and I really advice to invest in this skill. To start with Pandas, there is the [10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) in the Pandas documentation. Every year, there are great tutorials on PyCon. I really liked the talk from [Brandon Rhodes at PyCon2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw&t=4s). Also Daniel Chen did a very good [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qDhDXNRgHE) on Pandas. Get good at Pandas! I promise you will love it!"

    "When you are comfortable with Pandas, the next thing is to do data visualization. The plotting itself can be done with many different libraries. In the beginning, almost everybody used [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). It is easy to use but has its subtleties. Nowadays, I generally use [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), a framework on top of Matplotlib with much better defaults and a somewhat easier syntax. These are not the only options, there is also [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) and [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html), and actually many more. I think it is still useful to start with Matplotlib. After that, choose one of the others if you care about more eye-candy."

Kaggle is the ultimate resource to learn Data Science and Machine Learning problem based. If it is your first time, click to old-time favorite Titanic competition.
