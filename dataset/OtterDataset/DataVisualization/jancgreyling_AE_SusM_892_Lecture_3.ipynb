    "## Definition and Importance of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential initial step in the data analysis process. It involves visualizing, summarizing, and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and columns of data. The main aim of EDA is to understand the data, identify anomalies or outliers, uncover patterns, and extract valuable insights. This, in turn, provides a solid foundation for the subsequent analytical or modeling activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data in Applied Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various types of data that researchers and professionals in applied economics frequently encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical Data**: This data type represents categories or labels. It can be further divided into nominal (e.g., crop types like wheat, rice, maize) and ordinal data (e.g., low, medium, high).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numerical Data**: Represents numbers, and can be either discrete (e.g., number of farms) or continuous (e.g., rainfall in mm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time-series Data**: Observations recorded at regular time intervals. For instance, the monthly prices of a commodity over several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-sectional Data**: Observations recorded at the same point in time. An example could be the agricultural yield of different farms in a particular year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Panel Data**: This is a combination of time-series and cross-sectional data. For example, observing the yields of multiple farms over multiple years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help differentiate these data types further, here's a simple table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type        | Description                                           | Example                                       |\n",
    "|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Categorical      | Represents categories or labels                        | Crop types: Wheat, Rice                       |\n",
    "| Numerical        | Represents numbers                                     | Rainfall in mm, Number of farms               |\n",
    "| Time-series      | Observations over regular intervals                   | Monthly commodity prices over several years   |\n",
    "| Cross-sectional  | Observations at a specific point in time               | Agricultural yield of farms in a given year   |\n",

    "## Statistical Summaries in EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with any analytical approach, understanding the basic statistical properties of the dataset is essential. This process provides a snapshot of central tendencies, spread, and shape of the dataset's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming data is loaded in a dataframe named 'df'\n",
    "stats_summary = df.describe()\n",
    "print(stats_summary)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This provides count, mean, standard deviation, min, 25th percentile, median (50th percentile), 75th percentile, and max for all numerical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation and Association\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1, is the most widely used method to measure it. A value close to 1 implies a strong positive correlation, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. A value close to 0 implies a weak or no linear correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "correlation_matrix = df.corr()\n",
    "print(correlation_matrix)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This returns a matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients between every pair of numerical columns in the dataframe. A value close to 1 implies a strong positive correlation: as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase. A value close to -1 implies a strong negative correlation: as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",

    "### Detecting and Handling Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from other observations in the dataset. They might be a result of variability or errors. The Interquartile Range (IQR) method is commonly used to detect them. Here's the logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IQR**: It's the range between the first quartile (25%) and the third quartile (75%) in the dataset.\n",
    "- Any data point that falls below Q1 - 1.5I*QR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR is considered an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using IQR to flag outliers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of filtering out the outliers, you can create a new column in your dataframe that flags them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Q1 = df.quantile(0.25)\n",
    "Q3 = df.quantile(0.75)\n",
    "IQR = Q3 - Q1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new column 'is_outlier' that flags outliers with a '1' and '0' otherwise\n",
    "df['is_outlier'] = ((df < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))).any(axis=1).astype(int)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the dataframe `df` has a new column named `is_outlier` which flags the outliers as '1' and the other data points as '0'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lets break down the logic:**\n",
    "1. **Outlier Boundaries**: \n",
    "    - Lower Boundary: \\(Q1 - 1.5 \\times IQR\\)\n",
    "    - Upper Boundary: \\(Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR\\)\n",
    "   \n",
    "    These boundaries define what we consider as outliers based on the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Anything below the lower boundary or above the upper boundary is treated as an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Condition Checks**:\n",
    "    - \\(df < (Q1 - 1.5 \\times IQR)\\): This checks if each data point in the dataframe `df` is below the lower boundary.\n",
    "    - \\(df > (Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR)\\): This checks if each data point in `df` is above the upper boundary.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Conditions with OR (|)**:\n",
    "    - \\((df < (Q1 - 1.5 \\times IQR)) | (df > (Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR))\\): \n",
    "      This combines the two conditions using the \"OR\" operator `|`. If a data point satisfies either of the conditions, it's considered an outlier.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checking across rows with `.any(axis=1)`**:\n",
    "    - The `.any(axis=1)` method checks row-wise. If any column in a specific row is `True` (i.e., it's an outlier), the method returns `True` for that row. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Converting Boolean to Integer with `.astype(int)`**:\n",
    "    - The `True` and `False` values are then converted to integers (1 for `True` and 0 for `False`) using `.astype(int)`.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Storing the Results**:\n",
    "    - Finally, the result, which is a series of 1s and 0s indicating outliers and non-outliers respectively, is stored in a new column `is_outlier` in the dataframe `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this line of code creates a new column in the dataframe that flags outliers as '1' and non-outliers as '0' based on the IQR method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Z-Score and Modified Z-Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are also other methods to detect outliers, such as Z-Score and Modified Z-Score. Here's a quick summary of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-Score\n",
    "- Indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean.\n",
    "- Outliers typically have Z-scores > 3 or < -3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified Z-Score\n",
    "- Indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the median.\n",
    "- Hence this version uses median and Median Absolute Deviation (MAD).\n",
    "- Outliers often have scores > 3.5 or < -3.5."

    "### Python Libraries for Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is an integral part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as it allows for a graphical representation of information and data. Python offers a range of libraries tailored for various visualization needs. Here, we'll introduce three of the most popular ones:\n",
    "\n",
