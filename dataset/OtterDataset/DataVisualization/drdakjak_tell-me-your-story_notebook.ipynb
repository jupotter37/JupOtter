This resulted in a substantial double-digit increase in key performance metrics.  \\n- Data Processing and Analysis: Processed and analyzed terabytes of logs daily using an on-premise cluster. Developed and maintained a proprietary framework for data manipulation and quality checks. PySpark  \\n- Collaboration and Code Review: Worked closely with the ML engineering team to reimplement prototypes into the production environment and review production code. Participated in planning and prioritization meetings.  \\n- Highlighted projects:  \\n    * Model Improvement: Continuously improved online machine learning models through data cleaning, feature selection/extraction/engineering techniques, and conducting numerous offline and online tests. Vowpal Wabbit  \\n    * Recommendation Diversification: Developed an approach for recommendation diversification based on clustering of semantic and text vectors. scikit-learn  \\n    * Hyperparameter Optimization: Developed an approach based on the Nelder-Mead method, enabling real-time adjustments based on online metrics (e.g., user engagement). Python  \\n    * Offline Evaluation Framework: Created a framework for offline evaluation of models based on matrix factorization, leading to informed deployment and improved performance in online metrics. Python  \\n    * A/B/n Test Evaluation: Coauthored a proprietary library for A/B/n test evaluation based on a frequentist approach. Designed, evaluated, and interpreted results of A/B/n tests. Python, Pyspark, Statmodels  \\n    * Production Implementation: Implemented the machine learning component of a recommender system based on matrix factorization into production, significantly optimizing its memory efficiency and performance. NumPy, multiprocessing  \\n    * Contextual Bandits Research: Focused research on the field of contextual bandits, leading to collaboration with the counterpart research department and a publication (short paper) at SIGIR 2019.'},\n",
