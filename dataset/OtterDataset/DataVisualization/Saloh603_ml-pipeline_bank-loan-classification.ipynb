    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The GOAL IS!\n",
    "> - To sell more Personal Loan products to Bank customers.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "We performed the following steps:\n",
    "> - We check all twelve characteristics whether or not each of them has an association with the fact the product been sold.\n",
    "> - We find FIVE main characteristics that have higher than moderate strength of association with the product.\n",
    "> - We analyze main characteristics and get segments in each with different strength of association with the product.\n",
