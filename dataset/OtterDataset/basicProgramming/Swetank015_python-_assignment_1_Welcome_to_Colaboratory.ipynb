        "\n",
        "Ans. Python's popularity as a programming language can be attributed to several key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Readability and Simplicity:**\n",
        "   * **Clear Syntax:** Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and understand, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
        "   * **Indentation-based Structure:** Python uses indentation to define code blocks, eliminating the need for curly braces or semicolons, which can improve code readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Versatility and Applicability:**\n",
        "   * **Wide Range of Applications:** Python can be used for various tasks, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, automation, and more.\n",
        "   * **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Python runs on multiple operating systems, making it highly versatile and accessible to developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Extensive Standard Library:**\n",
        "   * **Built-in Modules:** Python comes with a rich standard library that provides modules for tasks like file I/O, network programming, regular expressions, and more.\n",
        "   * **Third-Party Libraries:** The Python Package Index (PyPI) offers a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks for specific domains, such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and Django.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Strong Community and Support:**\n",
        "   * **Active Community:** Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth and provide support through forums, tutorials, and open-source projects.\n",
        "   * **Abundant Resources:** There are numerous online resources, books, and courses available to help you learn Python and stay updated with the latest developments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Dynamic Typing:**\n",
        "   * **Flexible Data Types:** Python allows you to assign different data types to variables at runtime, making your code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**\n",
        "   * **Modular Structure:** Python supports OOP principles, enabling you to organize your code into reusable objects and classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. Interpreted Language:**\n",
        "   * **Rapid Development:** Python code is interpreted rather than compiled, allowing for faster development cycles and easier testing and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. Memory Management:**\n",
        "   * **Automatic Garbage Collection:** Python's built-in garbage collector handles memory management, freeing you from the burden of manual memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features combined make Python a powerful, versatile, and user-friendly language that has gained immense popularity among developers worldwide.\n",

        "  * `while`: Looping construct for repeating code until a condition is met.\n",
        "  * `break`: Terminates the current loop.\n",
        "  * `continue`: Skips the current iteration of a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Types and Structures:**\n",
