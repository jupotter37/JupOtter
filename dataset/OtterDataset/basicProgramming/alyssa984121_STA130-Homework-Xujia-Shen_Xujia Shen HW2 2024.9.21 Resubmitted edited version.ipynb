    "# Q1\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Importing Libraries and Initial Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** Imports the NumPy library as `np`, which is a library for working with arrays and random number generation.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** NumPy’s `np.random.choice` is used later to randomly select a winning door or a door to reveal. This mimics the randomness of door selection in the Monty Hall game.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)  # tuple\n",
    "my_door_choice = 1  # 1,2,3\n",
    "i_won = 0\n",
    "reps = 100000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:**\n",
    "  - `all_door_options`: Creates a tuple with the three door options, labeled 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "  - `my_door_choice`: Initially, the player always picks door 1. In the Monty Hall game, the player picks one of the three doors.\n",
    "  - `i_won`: Initializes a counter for the number of times the player wins using the switching strategy.\n",
    "  - `reps`: The simulation will repeat the Monty Hall game 100,000 times to estimate the probability of winning by switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - The tuple `all_door_options` holds the three doors, and the player starts by always choosing door 1. The large number of repetitions (`reps`) allows us to simulate enough games to approximate the winning probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Looping Through Simulations**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(reps):\n",
    "    secret_winning_door = np.random.choice(all_door_options)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** This loop runs the simulation `reps` (100,000) times.\n",
    "  - `secret_winning_door`: Randomly selects one of the three doors to hide the prize. This simulates the randomness of the prize placement in the Monty Hall game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - For each simulation iteration (`i`), the `secret_winning_door` is chosen using `np.random.choice`, which picks one door (1, 2, or 3) at random to be the winning door.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Preparing the List of Doors Monty Can Reveal**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** Converts the tuple `all_door_options` into a list called `all_door_options_list`.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. Since Monty will remove doors from the list during the game (doors with goats), we need a list that can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - By converting the tuple to a list, we can add or remove doors later as Monty reveals a goat or the player switches their choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Removing the Winning Door from Monty’s Reveal Options**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "all_door_options_list.remove(secret_winning_door)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** Removes the door with the prize (the `secret_winning_door`) from the list of available doors Monty can reveal.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - Monty knows where the prize is and will never reveal the winning door. This step ensures that Monty doesn’t accidentally reveal the door with the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - The `.remove()` method removes the `secret_winning_door` from `all_door_options_list`. Now Monty has two doors left in the list, both of which contain goats.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Handling the Player's Initial Door Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice)\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** Attempts to remove the player’s initial choice (`my_door_choice`) from the list of doors Monty can reveal. If the player’s choice is the same as the winning door, it will already be removed, so the `try-except` handles this case.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - Monty cannot reveal the door the player picked; he must reveal a different door with a goat.\n",
    "  - The `try-except` ensures that the code doesn’t crash if the player picked the winning door (since it was already removed in the previous step).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - If the player picked the `secret_winning_door`, the door is already removed from the list, and the `.remove()` operation would fail. The `except: pass` makes sure that this situation is handled gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Monty Reveals a Goat Door**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "goat_door_reveal = np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)\n",
    "all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:**\n",
    "  - `goat_door_reveal`: Randomly selects one of the remaining doors in `all_door_options_list` for Monty to reveal. Since Monty can only reveal a door with a goat, this will always be a non-winning door.\n",
    "  - `all_door_options_list.remove(goat_door_reveal)`: Removes the revealed goat door from the list, leaving only one unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:**\n",
    "  - Monty reveals a goat door, narrowing the player’s choices down to the initially chosen door and one other unopened door.\n",
    "  - By removing the revealed goat door, the list is reduced to only the doors that the player can potentially switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it Works:**\n",
    "  - `np.random.choice(all_door_options_list)` picks one of the remaining doors for Monty to reveal. After revealing the goat, we remove this door from the list, leaving only the player’s current door and the other remaining unopened door.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Adjusting the Remaining Doors**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if secret_winning_door != my_door_choice:\n",
    "    all_door_options_list.append(secret_winning_door)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** If the player’s initial choice was not the winning door, the winning door is added back to the list of remaining doors.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - If the player didn’t pick the winning door, Monty’s list no longer contains the winning door. This step puts the winning door back into the list so the player has the chance to switch to it.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - When the player’s initial choice is not the winning door, we append the `secret_winning_door` back to the list, giving the player the opportunity to switch to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Player Decides to Switch Doors**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_door_choice = all_door_options_list[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** The player switches their choice to the remaining unopened door (which is the only door left in `all_door_options_list`).\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - In this simulation, the player always switches doors after Monty reveals a goat. This is the key strategy that increases the player’s chances of winning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - Since only one door remains in `all_door_options_list`, the player automatically switches to that door.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Checking if the Player Won**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if my_door_choice == secret_winning_door:\n",
    "    i_won += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** If the player’s new choice (`my_door_choice`) matches the `secret_winning_door`, the player wins, and the win counter (`i_won`) is incremented by 1.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - This step checks the outcome of each game to see if the switching strategy resulted in a win.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - If the player’s switched door is the winning door, the `i_won` counter increases, tracking how many times the player won by switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Calculating the Win Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i_won / reps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it Does:** Divides the number of times the player won (`i_won`) by the total number of repetitions (`reps`) to calculate the probability of winning by switching.\n",
    "- **Why it’s Important:** \n",
    "  - This final calculation provides the simulated probability that the player wins by always switching doors, which should be approximately 2/3 (or 66.67%).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **How it Works:** \n",
    "  - Since the strategy of switching gives a higher probability of winning (because the player’s initial chance of picking the prize is only 1/3), this calculation will confirm that switching is the better strategy.\n",

    "# Between the original Monty Hall code and the simplified version you shared, the following changes have been made to enhance clarity and streamline the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifications and Enhancements:\n",
    "#1. **List and Tuple Handling**:\n",
    "   #- In the original code, the doors were initially stored as a tuple (`all_door_options = (1, 2, 3)`), and then converted to a list for processing (`all_door_options_list = list(all_door_options)`). The simplified code eliminates the tuple and directly starts with a list (`remaining_doors = [1, 2, 3]`), reducing unnecessary conversions and making the logic cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. **Try-Except Block Removed**:\n",
    "   #- The original code had a `try-except` block to handle cases where the contestant’s choice and the winning door were the same. This was removed in the simplified version by logically handling the door removal without error-catching, making the flow simpler and easier to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. **Monty's Door Reveal**:\n",
    "   #- Both codes determine which door Monty will reveal (a losing door). The simplified code handles this more clearly by using straightforward list operations: after removing the contestant’s choice, it checks if the winning door is still available and removes it if necessary. This step is logically clear and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. **Switch Door Selection**:\n",
    "   #- In the original code, after Monty reveals a door, there’s a step where the remaining doors are rebuilt, and the contestant switches to the only remaining door. The simplified code performs the same logic in fewer lines by re-creating the list of doors and removing the contestant’s choice and the revealed door, leaving just one option to switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. **Clearer Structure**:\n",
    "   #- The simplified code breaks the process down into clear, numbered steps, making it more readable. Each step is logically organized (selecting doors, revealing a door, switching, and checking the result), which enhances understanding without changing the underlying simulation logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. **Code Comments**:\n",
    "   #- The simplified code includes numbered comments for each step, which explain the purpose of each block of code in a structured manner. This makes it easier to follow for someone new to the Monty Hall problem or the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "#The simplified code eliminates unnecessary tuple-to-list conversion, removes the `try-except` block by handling all cases logically, and uses clearer list operations to determine Monty’s revealed door and the door to switch to. These changes result in a more readable and efficient version of the simulation without altering its functionality or accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preferences in terms of readibility or explainability between the original code and the code improvements suggested by the ChatBot:\n",
    "# The simplified version is easier to read and understand. It cuts out unnecessary steps like converting tuples to lists and avoids using confusing error-handling with `try-except`. \n",
    "#Instead, it uses straightforward list operations that make the whole process clearer. It breaks the code into simple and clear steps to make it easier to understand how the doors are chosen, revealed, and switched. \n",
    "#The original code is accurate, but involved complex logic and several steps that were hard to understand, which made it challenging for me to follow as a beginner in learning Python. \n",
    "#Each step in the simplified code is easy to trace, which helps in understanding how the simulation is performed and why each operation is necessary. \n",
    "#By focusing on the core logic without unnecessary complications, the simplified version makes it easier for me to grasp the process and verify that the implementation is correct. "

    "### Breakdown of the Code:\n",
    "1. **`reps = 100000`**: This sets the number of trials we’ll run in the simulation to 100,000.\n",
    "2. **`i_won = 0`**: A counter initialized to 0, used to count how many times the contestant wins by switching.\n",
    "3. **`for _ in range(reps):`**: This loop runs the simulation for the specified number of repetitions (`reps`).\n",
    "4. **`winning_door = np.random.choice([1, 2, 3])`**: Randomly select a door (1, 2, or 3) as the winning door.\n",
    "5. **`contestant_choice = np.random.choice([1, 2, 3])`**: The contestant also randomly picks a door.\n",
    "6. **`remaining_doors = [1, 2, 3]`**: This creates a list of all doors for future use in the game.\n",
    "7. **`remaining_doors.remove(contestant_choice)`**: The contestant’s chosen door is removed from the list.\n",
    "8. **`remaining_doors.remove(winning_door)`**: If the winning door is still in the list, it’s removed to prevent it from being revealed by Monty.\n",
    "9. **`revealed_door = np.random.choice(remaining_doors)`**: Monty randomly selects a door to reveal that isn't the contestant's choice or the winning door.\n",
    "10. **`remaining_doors = [1, 2, 3]`**: Resets the list of doors for determining the switching process.\n",
    "11. **`remaining_doors.remove(contestant_choice)`** and **`remaining_doors.remove(revealed_door)`**: These remove the contestant’s initial choice and the door Monty revealed.\n",
    "12. **`switch_choice = remaining_doors[0]`**: After removing the contestant’s choice and Monty’s revealed door, the only remaining door is the one the contestant will switch to.\n",
    "13. **`if switch_choice == winning_door:`**: This checks if the door the contestant switched to is the winning door.\n",
    "14. **`i_won += 1`**: If switching results in a win, increment the win counter.\n",
    "15. **`probability_of_winning = i_won / reps`**: Calculate the proportion of wins by switching out of the total number of repetitions.\n",
    "16. **`print(f\"Probability of winning by switching: {probability_of_winning:.5f}\")`**: Finally, the result is printed to 5 decimal places.\n",

    "# Q4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! This code snippet sets up a basic Markovian chatbot model, which is used to generate text based on the frequency of word sequences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how each part of the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports and Initializations\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "word_used = dict() # defaultdict(int)\n",
    "next_word = dict() # defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code imports `defaultdict` from the `collections` module but doesn’t use it here. Instead, it initializes `word_used` and `next_word` as regular dictionaries (`dict`).\n",
    "- `word_used` will store the count of how many times each word appears.\n",
    "- `next_word` will store the counts of how often each word is followed by another word.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop to Populate Dictionaries\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-1]):\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This loop iterates through each word in the `words` list except for the last one. `enumerate(words[:-1])` provides both the index (`i`) and the word (`word`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update `word_used`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if word in word_used:\n",
    "        word_used[word] += 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        word_used[word] = 1\n",
    "        next_word[word] = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If the current word is already in `word_used`, its count is incremented by 1.\n",
    "- If the word is not in `word_used`, it is added with a count of 1. Additionally, an entry for this word is created in `next_word` with an empty dictionary. This empty dictionary will later store the following words and their counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update `next_word`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if words[i+1] in next_word[word]:\n",
    "        next_word[word][words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        next_word[word][words[i+1]] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This part handles the transition counts: it checks the word following the current word (`words[i+1]`).\n",
    "- If this following word is already in the dictionary associated with the current word (`next_word[word]`), its count is incremented.\n",
    "- If it’s not in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **`word_used`** tracks how many times each word appears.\n",
    "- **`next_word`** tracks how often each word is followed by other words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows the chatbot to generate text by choosing words based on the frequency of their occurrence and the likelihood of their follow-up words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The APPLICATION of Markov Chains**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains can be used to predict events based on probabilities. For example, it help with text generation by predicting the next word in a sentence, which is how chatbots or autocomplete features work. In weather forecasting, it predict the next day’s weather based on the current conditions. It can also be used in Google’s PageRank algorithm, where it ranks web pages based on the probability of someone clicking on a link. In computer training, it is used in reinforcement learning, where machines learn to make decisions by predicting future states, like in game AI or self-driving cars. These systems learn by modeling what’s likely to happen next based on past data.\n",

    "## (1) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of EXTENSION 1 based on the explanation fo the original code in question 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and Data Preparation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "   characters = Counter(\"\\n\" + avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ', '.') + \":\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Imports:**\n",
    "     - `Counter` is used to count occurrences of items.\n",
    "     - `defaultdict` is a dictionary that provides default values for non-existent keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "     - `characters` is a `Counter` that processes the `avatar.character` column from a dataset:\n",
    "       - Converts the text to uppercase (`str.upper()`).\n",
    "       - Replaces spaces with periods (`str.replace(' ', '.')`).\n",
    "       - Prepends a newline character (`\"\\n\"`) and appends a colon (`\":\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define `nested_dict` Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `nested_dict` creates deeply nested default dictionaries. This means that any missing key automatically results in another `defaultdict` being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize Dictionaries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   word_used2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   next_word2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `word_used2C`: A nested dictionary for tracking word pairs and their frequencies for each character.\n",
    "   - `next_word2C`: A nested dictionary for tracking transitions between word pairs for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Process Words and Update Dictionaries:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "       if word in characters:\n",
    "           character = word\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The loop iterates over words, except the last two to avoid indexing errors.\n",
    "   - It checks if the `word` is in `characters`, and if so, assigns it to `character`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update `word_used2C`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if character not in word_used2C:\n",
    "       word_used2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "   if word + ' ' + words[i+1] not in word_used2C[character]:\n",

    "   word_used2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `character` is not yet in `word_used2C`, initialize it with an empty dictionary.\n",
    "   - Create or update the count for the word pair (`word + ' ' + words[i+1]`) in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update `next_word2C`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if character not in next_word2C:\n",
    "       next_word2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "   if word + ' ' + words[i+1] not in next_word2C[character]:\n",
    "       next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]] = dict()\n",
    "   if words[i+2] not in next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]]:\n",
    "       next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]][words[i+2]] = 0\n",
    "   next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]][words[i+2]] += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Similar to `word_used2C`, but here, it tracks transitions from one word pair to the next word.\n",
    "   - For each `character`, it creates or updates counts for word pairs and their following words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **`word_used2C`** tracks the frequency of word pairs for each character.\n",
    "- **`next_word2C`** records how often each word pair is followed by a specific word, for each character.\n",
    "- This extension code adds complexity by considering context (`character`) and word pairs, creating a more detailed Markov Chain model for analyzing sequences of words.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Imports and Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "characters = Counter(\"\\n\" + avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ', '.') + \":\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imports:**\n",
    "  - `Counter` from `collections` counts the occurrences of elements.\n",
    "  - `defaultdict` from `collections` is a dictionary that provides default values for non-existent keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "  - `avatar.character` is a column from the `avatar` dataset.\n",
    "  - `str.upper()` converts the text to uppercase.\n",
    "  - `str.replace(' ', '.')` replaces spaces with periods.\n",
    "  - `\"\\n\" + ... + \":\"` adds a newline at the beginning and a colon at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This creates a `Counter` called `characters` that counts how many times each unique formatted string (character name) appears in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Dictionary Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "word_used2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "next_word2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`nested_dict`:** A function that returns a `defaultdict` where the default value is another `defaultdict` created by the same `nested_dict` function. This creates a deeply nested dictionary structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`word_used2C` and `next_word2C`:** These are initialized as deeply nested dictionaries using `nested_dict()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Through Words and Update Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "    if word in characters:\n",
    "        character = word\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop:** Iterates over the `words` list except for the last two words (to prevent index errors when accessing `words[i+1]` and `words[i+2]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Character Check:** If `word` is found in `characters`, it’s assigned to `character`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update `word_used2C`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if character not in word_used2C:\n",
    "        word_used2C[character] = dict()\n",

    "    word_used2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary Initialization:** If `character` is not already in `word_used2C`, initialize it with an empty dictionary.\n",
    "- **Word Pair Count:** For each pair of consecutive words (`word + ' ' + words[i+1]`), update the count. If the pair doesn’t exist yet, initialize its count to 0 before incrementing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update `next_word2C`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if character not in next_word2C:\n",
    "        next_word2C[character] = dict()\n",
    "    if word + ' ' + words[i+1] not in next_word2C[character]:\n",

    "    next_word2C[character][word + ' ' + words[i+1]][words[i+2]] += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dictionary Initialization:** Similar to `word_used2C`, initialize `next_word2C` for the `character`. For each word pair (`word + ' ' + words[i+1]`), initialize its entry in `next_word2C` if it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "- **Word Transition Count:** Track transitions from a word pair to the next word (`words[i+2]`). Initialize counts and update them similarly.\n",

    "- Recording transitions from one word pair to the next word, for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `word_used2C` dictionary counts occurrences of word pairs for each character, while `next_word2C` tracks how often each word pair is followed by a specific next word. This provides a richer representation of word sequences and transitions in the text data.\n",

    "  - `word_used2C` and `next_word2C` are deeply nested dictionaries to handle complex relationships.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Processing:**\n",
    "  - For each word in the list, if it matches an entry in `characters`, it's used to update the context (`character`).\n",
    "  - **`word_used2C`**: Tracks the frequency of each word pair for the current `character`.\n",
    "  - **`next_word2C`**: Records how frequently a word pair is followed by a specific next word for the current `character`.\n",

    "# Q5(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and Setup**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from collections import Counter, defaultdict\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `Counter` is a dictionary subclass designed to count hashable objects.\n",
    "   - `defaultdict` is a dictionary subclass that provides a default value for missing keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing the 'character' Column**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   characters = Counter(\"\\n\"+ avatar.character.str.upper().str.replace(' ','.')+\":\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line processes the `character` column from the `avatar` dataset.\n",
    "   - `avatar.character.str.upper()` converts all characters to uppercase.\n",
    "   - `str.replace(' ', '.')` replaces spaces with dots.\n",
    "   - `\"\\n\" + ... + \":\"` adds a newline character at the beginning and a colon at the end of each character's name.\n",
    "   - `Counter` then counts the occurrences of each formatted character name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Nested Dictionary Creation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)\n",
    "   word_used2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   next_word2C = nested_dict()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `nested_dict` is a lambda function that creates a nested `defaultdict`. This means if a key is accessed that does not exist, a new `defaultdict` will be created for that key.\n",
    "   - `word_used2C` and `next_word2C` are initialized as nested dictionaries to track word pairs and word triplets respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing Words**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2]):\n",
    "       if word in characters:\n",
    "           character = word\n",

    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "When I interacted with ChatGPT, I think that it was efficient in providing answers. While working on the Monty Hall problem, I was trying to understand what each line of the code is doing and the logic of it. I asked ChatGPT to break down to each step, explain each code, and it responded fastly, which helped me get the clarity I needed without wasting time.When I moved on to the Markovian ChatBot code, I took a similar route. I started with the original code and inquired about the purpose of different sections. ChatGPT was quick to explain how each piece fit into the overall function. When I introduced the first extension, it continued to provide speedy answers about the changes I made. Given the complex version straightly, it still kept up that pace and gave me a ckear and quik response.\n",
    "From my personal experiences, ChatGPT helped me to make code easier to be understood and keep moving forward without getting stuck by confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I inquired about the basic details of the code, ChatGPT's explanations sometimes seemed too abstract, lacking sufficient clarity. As a beginner, I need a more direct understanding of basic operations, rather than just theoretical explanations. This often led to repeated questioning, such as asking, “So, you mean…” to clarify misunderstandings and the unclear part. Besides, while I was working on the Monty Hall problem, I asked why the code removed the winning door rather than my chosen door. I was confused about how removing the winning door would facilitate further calculations regarding whether to switch and how to determine the winning rate. Instead of directly addressing my concerns, ChatGPT suggested that I could remove my chosen door instead, which only added to my confusion and didn't resolve the main issue I was facing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on my experiences so far, I think ChatGPT is a very useful tool for understanding code and coding logics, writing code and troubleshooting coding issues. It can quickly explain foundamental concepts and provide theoretical explanations, which has been very important for my learning. ChatGPT can effectively break down the code to each step and gives a clear and detailed explanation, deepening my understanding of the questions. If I use google or other learning material, I won't et explanation that perfectly fullfill my needs. ChatGPT highly incerased my learning effciency in coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I've used ChatGPT to troubleshoot errors in previous homework assignments. It helped me identify issues in my code and suggested solutions. It also helps me to write some code sometimes and the answers are always able to be run successfully. It allows me to get quick feedback and guidance in learning code.\n",
    "Another great part of ChatGPT is that is responses based on our previous interactions. This makes the explanations more relevant and coherent, aligning with my specific questions and confusions. However, for basic knowledge and simple details, ChatGPT sometimes needs to provide more straightforward explanations rather than just more information. I found that its explanations can be abstract when it comes to foundational concepts, requiring extra time and effort to ask further explanations to understand. Overall, it is still a very useful and helpful learning material for learning code and statistical knowledge.\n"

    "\n",
    "Since starting this course, I have some different idea on the use of AI. At first, I thought that being able to use AI to write assignments would be very easy. However, when ChatGPT provided me with the answers to Homework 1, I found that every time I asked a question ChatGPT would give me a different answer, even when I asked the exact same question on a new page. I couldn't tell which answer was correct or if the code it gave me fulfilled the requirements of the homework. So I had to spend a lot of time asking ChatGPT questions until I could read the code and pick the most compatible submission from those answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I had questions about programming functions or statistical concepts, ChatGPT could provide quick responses to help me grasp the basics. ChatGPT is great at providing knowledge and explanations of concepts, and it is also very helpful in terms of modifying and improving code. However, when I need it to write code on its own to understand requirements and answer my confusion to provide me with a more detailed explanation, it sometimes fails to give me satisfactory answers. While AI can be an excellent resource and tool, it is only able to respond based on the database it gets from the internet, and differences in the data will affect its answers, just as people have different personalities and abilities under different upbringings, chatbot will not be able to meet and understand everyone's needs and questions. In the experience of using ChatGPT, there is no denying that it is a very powerful and useful tool, but it can only be used as a tool and cannot be the dominant one in work and study. In order to use it better, I needs to ask better questions when interacting with chatbots. Instead of being able to be vague, try to provide as much background information and specifics as possible so that the AI understands my needs and doubts. Additionally, using it to write code isn't as easy as one might think when there isn't a solid base of programming knowledge. I think I need to learn more about programming and explore how to communicate with this powerful AI tool in my future learning and coding ventures.\n",

    "This summary captures the key points and guidance provided for pursuing a career in data science or business analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get ready for a career as a business analyst, I’ll start by focusing on my education backgroud. I’m aiming for a degree of the double major in statistics and computer science. I will further try to pursue a MBA degree to get more business knowledge and to improve my soft skill. I’m also considering certifications like CFA to boost my credentials.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ChatBots like ChatGPT are fantastic for grasping the basics and understanding code structur, especially for simpler queries, they can sometimes miss the mark on more detailed or nuanced questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than describing ChatGPT's responses as high level or general，complex or easy, I think \"abstract\" and \"vague\" are more accurate. Its answers are often filled with technical jargon and complicated logic that make it hard to follow. I find myself constantly needing to ask for simpler, more straightforward explanations to really understand what it's saying. However, when asking Chatbot after learning a concept or code in class, I find its explanations are very easy to understand. I think ChatGPT isn’t well-suited for complete beginners, or at least beginners might need to repeatedly ask for more simplified answers. Its initial responses are great for those with some foundational knowledge—there’s no need to be an expert，but if someone is totally new to a topic, it can be difficult to follow. When I was learning about the `describe()` function, I simply wanted to understand the meaning behind each statistical metric. Instead of a straightforward explanation, I received a more general and theoriotical overview. Similarly, when I tackled the Monty Hall problem, I found myself wondering why the example code remove the winning door instead of 'my choice' door and how that affects the subsequent calculations. The Chatgpt suggested I could remove my chosen door also, and offer me a new code, which only added to my perplexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make our future conversations more productive, I’ve discovered that asking questions in a step-by-step manner works wonders. When I wanted to understand why using the tuple first and then use the list code in the Monty Hall problem. I want to know why can't I just use the list code straightly. I first inquired about their basic uses and functions, asking questions like \" can you explain tuple code for me?\" before moving on to more detailed question. This approach helps the ChatGPT find out where I’m coming from and what exactly I want to know. If the ChatBot’s answers still don’t fully address my questions, I can always reach out to my professor or a TA for additional help. \n"
