    "- In this use case, we will be building a \"system\" that helps to respond to customer's enquiries on training courses.\n",
    "- This notebook is designed to guide you through the process of creating a simplified \"end-to-end system\" that leverages advanced prompting and chaining techniques that we have learnt in topic 3 of the Bootcamp. These techniques allow for more complex and interactive user experiences, as they enable the system to ask follow-up questions based on user input and maintain context across multiple interactions (similar to ChatGPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here's what you can expect from this notebook:  \n",
    "    - **Data Preparation**: This includes loading and preparing the data. The data includes details about various training courses, such as course name, category, duration, price, etc, that are stored in a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Query Categorization**: We will develop a function to categorize incoming user queries. This function will help us understand whether the user is asking about a specific course, having account issues, facing registration problems, or other types of queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Course Information Retrieval**: Based on the categorized queries, we will retrieve relevant course information from our data. For instance, if a user is asking about a specific course, we will fetch all the details related to that course.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Response Generation**: After retrieving the necessary information, we will generate a response to the user's query. The response will be informative and detailed, providing the user with all the information they need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Malicious Intent Detection**: To ensure the safety and integrity of our system, we will implement a function to detect any malicious intentions in the user's queries, such as attempts to inject harmful instructions.  \n",
