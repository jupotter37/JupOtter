    "When naming variables in Python, it is important to follow some basic conventions. This will make your code more readable and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips for naming variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use descriptive variable names.** The name of a variable should describe what it stores. For example, instead of using the variable name `x`, use a more descriptive name such as `customer_name` or `total_price`.\n",
    "* **Use lowercase letters.** Variable names should be written in lowercase letters, with the exception of acronyms. For example, the variable name `customerName` is not acceptable. Instead, use the variable name `customer_name`.\n",
    "* **Use underscores to separate words.** If a variable name consists of multiple words, use underscores to separate the words. For example, the variable name `customer_name` is acceptable.\n",
    "* **Avoid using reserved words.** Reserved words are special words that have a specific meaning to the Python interpreter. Do not use reserved words as variable names. For example, the word `class` is a reserved word, so you should not use it as a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of good variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `customer_name`\n",
    "* `total_price`\n",
    "* `product_id`\n",
    "* `order_date`\n",
    "* `is_active`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of bad variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x`\n",
    "* `y`\n",
    "* `z`\n",
    "* `customerName`\n",
    "* `class`\n"
