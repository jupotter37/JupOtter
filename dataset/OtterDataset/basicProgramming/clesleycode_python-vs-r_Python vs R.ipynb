    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is an interdisciplinary field where scientific techniques from statistics, mathematics, and computer science are used to analyze data and solve problems more accurately and effectively. It is no wonder, then, that languages such as R and Python, with their extensive packages and libraries that support statistical methods and machine learning algorithms are cornerstones of the data science revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## R\n",
    "\n",
    "R is an open source, statistical computing language created with the intention of making data analysis, statistical models and graphical models easier. R has a large repository of packages called <b>CRAN</b> that users routinely contribute to. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of R’s main strengths is that it has a very active community that provides ample support to users via mailing lists, StackOverFlow forums, and very extensive documentation of all its packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "R has a slightly quirky syntax which can be hard to pick up for beginners but is especially suited for people from a statistical and research background looking to get started with creating their models quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high level, interpreted, general purpose language that was built to improve programmer productivity and code readability. It is usually the preferred language for programmers and people with a computer science background looking to get into data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a very flexible language, making it great for production level work and, like R, has libraries of packages around statistics and machine learning in <b>pip</b>, the repository of Python packages. It has great community support, although being a general purpose language it is not all concentrated around data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage to using Python is the availability of packages such as Theano, Keras, scikit-learn that are important machine learning and deep learning libraries used by both academic research purposes as well as for commercial intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing\n",
    "\n",
    "As professional problem solvers, data science practitioners need to have a versatile set of tools as part of their repertoire. While learning both R and Python is ideal, given that R makes data cleaning and manipulation a very easy task while Python is better for building models on larger data sets and scale, we all have to begin somewhere. And the right choice for you can be determined by the following factors - previous programming experience, educational background, career aspirations, and interest in working with deep learning technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Previous Programming Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any programming experience prior to learning data science, our recommendation would be for you to learn Python. It’s clear syntax would be easy for you to take up; and with it being a general purpose language, you’d have the added flexibility for building novel stuff. Even a complete novice is advised to learn Python, as it is one of the most beginner friendly languages in Computer Science, being the most popular introductory teaching language in the top U.S. universities (Communications of the ACM article, 2014). R code gets to the point more quickly and is less verbose as well, but it has a quirky syntax that would be difficult to learn for both hardcore programmers and beginners alike. We recommend this course for those interested in learning Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Educational Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a background in statistics or mathematics makes R a better choice for you. This is because R is a domain specific language created specifically for statistics, making its usage intuitive for people with a degree in statistics. R was created by statisticians and made with other statisticians in mind, so having a grasp of statistical analysis makes the transition into this language all the more easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Career Aspirations\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data analyst/business analyst/financial analyst, your focus would be on extracting the most information out of your data, without needing to create a product out of your content. For this reason, learning R and a database language like SQL would serve you better as R is great for working with tabular data on a single system/server and has great libraries like ggplot2 for easy visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a data scientist has different requirements, as they’re expected to carry out analysis as well as create products such as machine learning engines that work on the database of a website or a software. This would require both software development as well as predictive modelling work which can be better accomplished by a general purpose language like Python. These principles would apply across all industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interest in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is the trending topic du jour and anyone with an interest in contributing to the growth of artificial intelligence technology should be learning Python. Its overwhelming popularity for both machine learning as well as deep learning comes from the fact that Python acts as an interface between the programmer and lower level languages like C/C++, this making it very easy for experimenting, creating models and debugging without compromising on computational speed (as the machine uses C/C++and CUDA technology to build the models). This makes Python a very accessible language for mathematicians and statisticians looking to create neural network models without having to start creating them from scratch due to the pre-existing frameworks provided by Python. \n"

    "# Final Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Python and R have their own strengths and weaknesses. As we'll go into soon, Python is a much more dynamic language whereas R has great statistical support. Combining both language's strengths and weaknesses is the ideal scenario - we'll go into what that looks like soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "### R Statistical Support\n",
    "\n",
    "R was built as a statistical language, and it shows. `statsmodels` in Python and other packages provide decent coverage for statistical methods, but the R ecosystem is far larger. R has a rich ecosystem of cutting-edge packages and active community. Packages are available at CRAN, BioConductor and Github. You can search through all R packages at Rdocumentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Non-Statistical Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose language that is easy and intuitive. This gives it a relatively flat learning curve, and it increases the speed at which you can write a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Python testing framework is a built-in, low-barrier-to-entry testing framework that encourages good test coverage. This guarantees your code is reusable and dependable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are an important criteria when choosing data analysis software. Although Python has some nice visualization libraries, such as Seaborn, Bokeh and Pygal, there are maybe too many options to choose from. Moreover, compared to R, visualizations are usually more convoluted, and the results are not always so pleasing to the eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "In R, visualized data can often be understood more efficiently and effectively than the raw numbers alone. R and visualization are a perfect match. Some must-see visualization packages are ggplot2, ggvis, googleVis and rCharts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "R was developed for statisticians, so its code is not necessarily the most efficient. Although R can be experienced as slow, there are multiple packages to improve R’s performance: pqR, renjin and FastR, Riposte and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When do we use each then? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python when your data analysis needs to be integrated with web apps or if your statistical code needs to be incorporated into a production database. Being a dynamic programming language, it’s a great tool to implement algorithms for production use. If your data analysis needs integration with a web application or database, Python is probably your best bet. Compared to R, the support for these sorts of application is much better since it's more of a general-purpose language. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### R \n",
    "\n",
    "R is mainly for when the data analysis task requires standalone computing. It’s great for exploratory work and for almost any type of data analysis because of the huge number of packages and readily usable tests that often provide you with the necessary tools to get up and running quickly. R can even be part of a big data solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When getting started with R, a good first step is to install RStudio. Once this is done, you should continue to have a look at the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- dplyr, plyr and data.table to easily manipulate packages,\n",
    "- stringr to manipulate strings,\n",
    "- zoo to work with regular and irregular time series,\n",
    "- ggvis, lattice, and ggplot2 to visualize data, and\n",
    "- caret for machine learning\n"
