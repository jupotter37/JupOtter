    "# Chapter 1. Language Processing and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to get our hands on millions of words of text. What can we do with it, assuming we can write some simple programs? In this chapter, we’ll address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What can we achieve by combining simple programming techniques with large quantities of text?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How can we automatically extract key words and phrases that sum up the style and content of a text?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What tools and techniques does the Python programming language provide for such work?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are some of the interesting challenges of natural language processing?\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is divided into sections that skip between two quite different styles. In the “computing with language” sections, we will take on some linguistically motivated programming tasks without necessarily explaining how they work. In the “closer look at Python” sections we will systematically review key programming concepts. We’ll flag the two styles in the section titles, but later chapters will mix both styles without being so up-front about it. We hope this style of introduction gives you an authentic taste of what will come later, while covering a range of elementary concepts in linguistics and computer science. If you have basic familiarity with both areas, you can skip to Automatic Natural Language Understanding; we will repeat any important points in later chapters, and if you miss anything you can easily consult the online reference material at http://www.nltk.org/. If the material is completely new to you, this chapter will raise more questions than it answers, questions that are addressed in the rest of this book."

On a Mac you can find this under Applications→MacPython, and on Windows under All Programs→Python. Under Unix you can run Python from the shell by typing idle (if this is not installed, try typing python).

    "### Counting Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious fact about texts that emerges from the preceding examples is that they differ in the vocabulary they use. In this section, we will see how to use the computer to count the words in a text in a variety of useful ways. As before, you will jump right in and experiment with the Python interpreter, even though you may not have studied Python systematically yet. Test your understanding by modifying the examples, and trying the exercises at the end of the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s begin by finding out the length of a text from start to finish, in terms of the words and punctuation symbols that appear. We use the term len to get the length of something, which we’ll apply here to the book of Genesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    ">>> len(text3)<br>\n",
    "44764<br>\n",
    ">>><br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "So Genesis has 44,764 words and punctuation symbols, or “tokens.” A token is the technical name for a sequence of characters—such as hairy, his, or :)—that we want to treat as a group. When we count the number of tokens in a text, say, the phrase to be or not to be, we are counting occurrences of these sequences. Thus, in our example phrase there are two occurrences of to, two of be, and one each of or and not. But there are only four distinct vocabulary items in this phrase. How many distinct words does the book of Genesis contain? To work this out in Python, we have to pose the question slightly differently. The vocabulary of a text is just the set of tokens that it uses, since in a set, all duplicates are collapsed together. In Python we can obtain the vocabulary items of text3 with the command: set(text3). When you do this, many screens of words will fly past. Now try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    ">>> sorted(set(text3)) 1<br>\n",
    "['!', \"'\", '(', ')', ',', ',)', '.', '.)', ':', ';', ';)', '?', '?)',<br>\n",
    "'A', 'Abel', 'Abelmizraim', 'Abidah', 'Abide', 'Abimael', 'Abimelech',<br>\n",
    "'Abr', 'Abrah', 'Abraham', 'Abram', 'Accad', 'Achbor', 'Adah', ...]<br>\n",
    ">>> len(set(text3)) 2<br>\n",
    "2789<br>\n",
    ">>><br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "By wrapping sorted() around the Python expression set(text3) 1, we obtain a sorted list of vocabulary items, beginning with various punctuation symbols and continuing with words starting with A. All capitalized words precede lowercase words. We discover the size of the vocabulary indirectly, by asking for the number of items in the set, and again we can use len to obtain this number 2. Although it has 44,764 tokens, this book has only 2,789 distinct words, or “word types.” A word type is the form or spelling of the word independently of its specific occurrences in a text—that is, the word considered as a unique item of vocabulary. Our count of 2,789 items will include punctuation symbols, so we will generally call these unique items types instead of word types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s calculate a measure of the lexical richness of the text. The next example shows us that each word is used 16 times on average (we need to make sure Python uses floating-point division):\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",

    ">>><br>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",

    "***\n",
    "    \n",
    "You may want to repeat such calculations on several texts, but it is tedious to keep retyping the formula.

Now you only have to type a short name instead of one or more complete lines of Python code, and you can reuse it as often as you like. The block of code that does a task for us is called a function, and we define a short name for our function with the keyword def.

Similarly, percentage() is defined to take two parameters, labeled count and total 3.\n",

Search engines have been crucial to the growth and popularity of the Web, but have some shortcomings. It takes skill, knowledge, and some luck, to extract answers to such questions as: What tourist sites can I visit between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on a limited budget? What do experts say about digital SLR cameras? What predictions about the steel market were made by credible commentators in the past week? Getting a computer to answer them automatically involves a range of language processing tasks, including information extraction, inference, and summarization, and would need to be carried out on a scale and with a level of robustness that is still beyond our current capabilities.\n",

This would force you to invent bizarre images, like a tennis pro taking out his frustrations on a china tea-set laid out beside the court. In other words, we automatically disambiguate words using context, exploiting the simple fact that nearby words have closely related meanings. As another example of this contextual effect, consider the word by, which has several meanings, for example, the book by Chesterton (agentive—Chesterton was the author of the book); the cup by the stove (locative—the stove is where the cup is); and submit by Friday (temporal—Friday is the time of the submitting). Observe in Example 1-3 that the meaning of the italicized word helps us interpret the meaning of by.\n",

The preposition before is initially translated into the corresponding German preposition vor, but later into the conjunction bevor (line 5). After line 5 the sentences become non-sensical (but notice the various phrasings indicated by the commas, and the change from jump to leap). The translation system did not recognize when a word was part of a proper name, and it misinterpreted the grammatical structure. The grammatical problems are more obvious in the following example.

Today these difficulties are being faced by collecting massive quantities of parallel texts from news and government websites that publish documents in two or more languages. Given a document in German and English, and possibly a bilingual dictionary, we can automatically pair up the sentences, a process called text alignment. Once we have a million or more sentence pairs, we can detect corresponding words and phrases, and build a model that can be used for translating new text.  "

In contrast, today’s commercial dialogue systems are very limited, but still perform useful functions in narrowly defined domains, as we see here:\n",

This inference seems so obvious that you probably didn’t notice it was made, yet a natural language system needs to be endowed with this capability in order to interact naturally. Without it, when asked, Do you know when Saving Private Ryan is playing?, a system might unhelpfully respond with a cold Yes. However, the developers of commercial dialogue systems use contextual assumptions and business logic to ensure that the different ways in which a user might express requests or provide information are handled in a way that makes sense for the particular application. So, if you type When is ..., or I want to know when ..., or Can you tell me when ..., simple rules will always yield screening times. This is enough for the system to provide a useful service.\n",

Along the middle, moving from right to left, is the reverse pipeline of components for converting concepts to speech. These components make up the dynamic aspects of the system. At the bottom of the diagram are some representative bodies of static information: the repositories of language-related data that the processing components draw on to do their work.\n",

    "### Textual Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of language understanding has been brought into focus in recent years by a public “shared task” called Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE). The basic scenario is simple. Suppose you want to find evidence to support the hypothesis: Sandra Goudie was defeated by Max Purnell, and that you have another short text that seems to be relevant, for example, Sandra Goudie was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 elections, narrowly winning the seat of Coromandel by defeating Labour candidate Max Purnell and pushing incumbent Green MP Jeanette Fitzsimons into third place. Does the text provide enough evidence for you to accept the hypothesis? In this particular case, the answer will be “No.” You can draw this conclusion easily, but it is very hard to come up with automated methods for making the right decision. The RTE Challenges provide data that allow competitors to develop their systems, but not enough data for “brute force” machine learning techniques (a topic we will cover in Chapter 6). Consequently, some linguistic analysis is crucial. In the previous example, it is important for the system to note that Sandra Goudie names the person being defeated in the hypothesis, not the person doing the defeating in the text. As another illustration of the difficulty of the task, consider the following text-hypothesis pair:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1-7. \n",

    "\n",
    "    Hypothesis: Golinkin has written 18 books\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine whether the hypothesis is supported by the text, the system needs the following background knowledge: (i) if someone is an author of a book, then he/she has written that book; (ii) if someone is an editor of a book, then he/she has not written (all of) that book; (iii) if someone is editor or author of 18 books, then one cannot conclude that he/she is author of 18 books."

    "Despite the research-led advances in tasks such as RTE, natural language systems that have been deployed for real-world applications still cannot perform common-sense reasoning or draw on world knowledge in a general and robust manner. We can wait for these difficult artificial intelligence problems to be solved, but in the meantime it is necessary to live with some severe limitations on the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of natural language systems. Accordingly, right from the beginning, an important goal of NLP research has been to make progress on the difficult task of building technologies that “understand language,” using superficial yet powerful techniques instead of unrestricted knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Indeed, this is one of the goals of this book, and we hope to equip you with the knowledge and skills to build useful NLP systems, and to contribute to the long-term aspiration of building intelligent machines."
