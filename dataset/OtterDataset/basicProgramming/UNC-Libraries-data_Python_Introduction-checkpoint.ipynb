    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a programming language?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages allow one to write instructions in human-readable form that can then be read and understood by a computer. \"High level\" languages like Python translate sets of commands or instructions (programs) created by people (programmers) to \"low level\" languages more readily understood by the computer. Once these instructions have been translated the computer can then follow the steps within to perform a specific task. (For more information on high- and low-level languages, please see this [definition](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/high-low-level-languages).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language that has become popular for data and text analysis.  Python can be easier to learn than other languages because it emphasizes (human) readability and flexibility.  Python is [the second most used language on GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/#trends); this means you'll find packages (sets of functionality developed by other users) to use Python for a wide variety of problems and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't worked with a programming language before, learning Python will introduce you to methods used in many programming languages, making it easier to learn other languages like Java and R later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scripting\n",
    "Writing code to automate repeptitive tasks.  For example, you might need to extract text from thousands of pdf files and sort them into directories based on whether the texts mention particular phrases.  To do this, you would need to create instructions for how to find the pdfs (and skip any non-pdfs!), open them, extract text, search for the key terms, then move the file to the proper final location.   In this series, we'll learn about some of the fundamental building blocks for translating a such processes into instructions the computer can understand.  The other uses outlined below often involve some element of automation!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "The `NLTK` package provides tools for dealing with unstructured text such as parsing words and sentences, or tagging parts of speech.  `tesseract` applies optical character recognition (OCR) to transform images into machine readable text.  Other packages provide access to algorithms like topic modeling on text corpora.  Scripting to automate these steps is necessary to apply these algorithms to the vast corpora common in NLP (for example, [Early English Books Online](https://eebo.chadwyck.com/about/about.htm) provides access to 130,000 works produced in English from 1473-1700).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science\n",
    "Python has a well-developed ecosystem of specialized tools and functions for everything from fitting deep learning models with `tensorflow` to creating visualizations with `seaborn`.  Most of these tasks aren't directly covered in Python's standard functionality (our focus today).  Later on, we'll explore some of the foundational packages used for Data Science in Python: the SciPy ecosystem, especially `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Others\n",
    "There are also packages available in Python for web development (`Django`), image processing (`pillow`), web scraping (`BeautifulSoup`), APIs, databases, games (`pygame`), psychological experiments (`PsychoPy`), astronomy (`astropy`), and many many other uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks are a popular tool to share python code in a \"literate\" format, mixing regular english with code and outputs, including formatted tables, visualizations, etc., for easy comprehension by non-Python users.  We'll explore Jupyter Notebooks later on in this series of workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are few things you can do in Python that can't also be done in other languages!  If you already know one or more programming language, you'll have to decide where Python best fits in your own workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python vs. R\n",
    "\n",
    "R is another popular language often compared to Python in the realm of data science.  Each has relative strengths and weaknesses, but in most cases Python and R can ultimately accomplish the same goals.  We also teach a series of workshops introducing the R language: [R Open Labs](http://ropenlabs.web.unc.edu/), however we usually recommend that you focus on one \n",
    "language at a time to avoid confusion!\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Python 2 vs. Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Python 2 and Python 3 are widely used in research.  Unfortunately, while both Python 2 and 3 are very similar, there are a few key syntax differences: Python 3 cannot always run Python 2 code (or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 was released in 2008; since then, nearly all important tools have been re-written or updated for Python 3.  **Python 2 is not maintained as of January 1, 2020.**  This workshop will use **Python 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=red>Warning!</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already comfortable with basic programming concepts, you'll probably find this workshop very straightforward.  The later workshops in the series may be more helpful if you're already familiar with the concepts below and just need to learn new syntax.  Experienced attendees are more than welcome to stay, review, and help others!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDEs\n",
    "\n",
    "An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is software that combines many tools to help you use a programming language, such as a code editor, compiler, and debugger in a convenient interface. There are many different IDEs to choose from.  IDEs are not necessary, but are often good for beginners and useful for experienced users.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you gain experience, you can choose whether an IDE is right for your uses and which one works best for you. For the purposes of this workshop, we will use Spyder, which comes packaged with Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Spyder:\n",
    "* **Windows**: Start>Anaconda3 64-bit>Spyder\n",
    "* **Mac**: Applications>Anaconda Navigator>Spyder\n",

    "![SpyderIDE.png](https://github.com/UNC-Libraries-data/Python/raw/master/Intro/images/SpyderIDE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spyder's default interface provides three panes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Editor pane (left) is a scripting window for writing Python code for *reuse or sharing* later.\n",
    " + Scripts should be self contained to ensure easy reuse later on.  You should always be able to restart and run your script from scratch to make sure you haven't left anything important out.\n",
    "* The Console pane (bottom right) contains a console for executing code.  We'll use this to *test our code* interactively.\n",
    "* The Explorer pane (top right) contains other helpful tools listing defined variables, files in the working directory, and other help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Code prepared in a simple text editor (not a formatted editor like Microsoft Word) can be executed (run) using your computer's command line or terminal.  "
