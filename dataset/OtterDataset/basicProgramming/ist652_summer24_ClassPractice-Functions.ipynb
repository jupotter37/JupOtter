    "## The Credit Card Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to do commerce on the web, you're going to support credit cards. But how do you know if a given number is valid? And how do you know which network issued the card?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Is `5300023581452982` a valid credit card number?Is it? Visa? MasterCard, Discover? or American Express?\n",
    "\n",
    "While eventually the card number is validated when you attempt to post a transaction, there's a lot of reasons why you might want to know its valid before the transaction takes place. The most common being just trying to catch an honest key-entry mistake made by your site visitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are two things we'd like to figure out, for any \"potential\" card number:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who is the issuing network? Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express.\n",
    "- IS the number potentially valid (as opposed to a made up series of digits)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does this have to do with functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we get this code to work, it seems like it might be useful to re-use it in several other programs we may write in the future. We can do this by writing the code as a **function**. Think of a function as an independent program its own inputs and output. The program is defined under a name so that we can use it simply by calling its name. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** `n = int(\"50\")` the function `int()` takes the string `\"50\"` as input and converts it to an `int` value `50` which is then stored in the value `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create these credit card functions, we might want to re-use them by placing them in a **Module** which is a file with a collection of functions in it. Furthermore we can take a group of related modules and place them together in a Python **Package**. You install packages on your computer with the `pip` command. \n"
