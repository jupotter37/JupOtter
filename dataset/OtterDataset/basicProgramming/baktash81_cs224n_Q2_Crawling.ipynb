There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting. Because such answers are so easy to produce, a large number of people are posting a <em>lot</em> of answers. The volume of these answers (thousands) and the fact that the answers often require a detailed read by someone with at least some subject matter expertise in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.</p>\n",

It is intended to be a resource for people who are looking for help with specific programming problems or who want to learn more about a particular topic. Because AI-generated answers may not always be accurate or relevant, they could potentially cause confusion or mislead users who are looking for help on Stack Overflow. In addition, AI-generated answers may not always follow the formatting and style guidelines of the site, which could make them difficult to read or understand. For these reasons, it may be appropriate for Stack Overflow to ban AI-generated answers.</p>\n",

For one, AI-generated answers could potentially provide more accurate and detailed answers to users' questions. This could be especially useful for complex technical questions that may be difficult for human experts to answer. Additionally, AI-generated answers could help to reduce the workload for human experts, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.</p>\n",

For example, AI-generated answers may not always be accurate or helpful, and there may be concerns about the potential for bias in the algorithms used to generate answers. Additionally, some users may have concerns about the use of AI in general, and may prefer to receive answers from human experts.</p>\n",

Language models are an essential part of tools like automatic translators; they tell us how probable it is that any given sentence is a valid English (or whatever language) sentence written as a native speaker would<sup>1</sup>, which lets us favor translations that are idiomatic over ones that just translate individual words without considering how the sentence flows. The systems can be trivially modified to generate text, if instead of looking up the word you have in the probability distribution it provides, you instead <em>select</em> the next word according to that distribution, which is how these chat bots work.</p>\n",
              " <p>Because the goal is to produce output that looks like native English text, the models are trained to assign high probabilities to existing text samples, and evaluated based on how well they predict <em>other</em> (previously unseen) samples. Which, for a language model, is a <em>fine</em> objective function. It will favor models that produce syntactically correct text, use common idioms over semantically similar but uncommon phrases, don't shift topics too often, etc. Some level of actual understanding <em>does</em> exist in these models<sup>2</sup>, but it's on the level of knowing that two words or phrases have similar meanings, or that certain parts of a paragraph relate to each other.

If you have a question for which there is a commonly held false belief or an answer that can be constructed out of common idioms and otherwise excellent grammar, the model is quite likely to report those instead of the real answer, because <em>semantic correctness is not what a language model is trained for</em>.</p>\n",

While certain SE sites definitely have their share of duplicate information (e.g. SO has a lot of questions whose answers can be found in documentation), it's still generally of no value to add additional duplication, especially when that information is just a copy of a Q/A session that can be had with a given GPT bot at any time.

              " <p>This means that if we can't ensure that most answers remain generated by humans, this will lead to a catastrophic failure of AI models, as it will simply become impossible to use newer data to make newer models: 2022 will become an \"event horizon for AI\" , with data generated prior to this year being still usable for training, but any data generated past being mostly unusable because of being tainted potentially in great proportions by AI generated content.</p>\n",

              " <p>There are three classes of amateur radio licenses in the United States: Technician, General, and Extra. Each class of license has its own set of privileges and requirements.</p>\n",
              " <p>The Technician class license is the entry-level license for amateur radio operators. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies above 30 megahertz, including the very popular 2-meter and 70-centimeter bands. Technician licensees are not allowed to use the HF (high-frequency) bands, which are the bands used for long-distance communication.</p>\n",
              " <p>The General class license is the intermediate level license. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies, including the HF bands. General class licensees are also allowed to use higher-power transmitters and to operate certain types of equipment that are not available to Technician licensees.</p>\n",
              " <p>The Extra class license is the highest level of amateur radio license. It allows the licensee to operate on all amateur radio frequencies, including the HF bands, and to use the highest power levels allowed by law. Extra class licensees are also allowed to use a wider range of equipment and to operate in certain types of specialized modes, such as digital modes and satellite communications.</p>\n",
              " <p>To obtain an amateur radio license, an individual must pass a written examination administered by a team of volunteer examiners. The examination covers the rules and regulations governing the operation of amateur radio stations, as well as basic concepts in electronics and radio theory. The level of difficulty of the examination increases with each class of license, with the Extra class license being the most difficult to obtain.</p>\n",
