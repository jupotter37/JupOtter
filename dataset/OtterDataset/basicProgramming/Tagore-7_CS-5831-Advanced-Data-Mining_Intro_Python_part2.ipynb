        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most important lesson in debugging is that it is **largely avoidable** -- if you work carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Understand the Problem**  You must have a firm grasp on **what** you are trying to accomplish but not necessarily **how** to do it. You do not need to understand the entire problem. But you must understand at least a portion of it and what the program should do in a specific circumstance -- what output should be produced for some given input. This will allow you to test your progress. You can then identify if a solution is correct or whether there remains work to do or bugs to fix. This is probably the single  biggest piece of advice for programmers at every level.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Start Small**  It is tempting to sit down and crank out an entire program at once.  But, when the program  -- inevitably -- does not work, you have a myriad of options for things that might be wrong.  Where to start? Where to look first?  How to figure out what went wrong?  I'll get to that in the next section.  So, start with something really small.  Maybe just two lines and then make sure that runs.  Hitting the run button is quick and easy. It gives you immediate feedback about whether what you have just done works or not.  Another immediate benefit of having something small working is that you have something to turn in.  Turning in a small, incomplete program, is almost always better than nothing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Keep Improving It**  Once you have a small part of your program working, the next step is to figure out something small to add to it -- how can you move closer to a correct solution. As you add to your program, you gain greater insight into the underlying problem you are trying to solve.  \n",
        "If you keep adding small pieces of the program one at a time, it is much easier to figure out what went wrong. (This of course means you must be able to recognize if there is an error. And that is done through testing.)  \n",
        "As long as you always test each new bit of code, it is most likely that any error is in the new code you have just added. Less new code means its easier to figure out where the problem is.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notion of **Get something working and keep improving it** is a mantra that you can repeat throughout your  career as a programmer.  It's a great way to avoid the frustrations mentioned above.  Think of it this way.   Every time you have a little success, your brain releases a tiny bit of chemical that makes you happy.  So, you can keep yourself happy and make programming more enjoyable by creating lots of small victories for yourself.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Finding Clues**  One thing that can help you in this situation is to print out the values and the types of the variables involved in the statement that is causing the error.  You might try adding a print statement after line 4 ``print(x, type(x))``  You will see that at least we have confirmed that x is of type string.  Now you need to start to work backward through the program.  You need to ask yourself, where is x used in the program?  x is used on lines 2, 3, and of course 5 and 6 (where we are getting an error).  So maybe you move the print statement to be after line 2 and again after 3.  Line 3 is where you expect the value of x to be changed to an integer.  Could line 4 be mysteriously changing x back to a string?  Not very likely.  So the value and type of x is just what you would expect it to be after line 2, but not after line 3.  This helps you isolate the problem to line 3.  In fact if you employ one of our earlier techniques of commenting out line 3 you will see that this has no impact on the error, and is a big clue that line 3 as it is currently written is useless.\n",

Notice that the words \"current time\" are a different color than those around them.  Why is this?  Because \"current time\" is in double quotes inside another pair of double quotes Python thinks that you are finishing off one string, then you have some other names and finally another string.  But you haven't separated these names or strings by commas, and you haven't added them together with the concatenation operator (+).  So, there are several corrections you could make.  First you could make the argument to input be as follows:  ``\"What is the 'current time' (in hours 0-23)\"``  Notice that here we have correctly used single quotes inside double quotes.   Another option is to simply remove the extra double quotes.  Why were you quoting \"current time\" anyway?  ``\"What is the current time (in hours 0-23)\"``\n",

You can see the function call on line 3 where you are converting x to an integer.  ``int(x)`` or so you think.
