      "Welcome to _An Introduction to Python for new Programmers_! This iPython notebook serves as an instructor-led guide to the Python programming language, particularly for those who are new to programming or have very limited programming experience. iPython notebooks are a novel form of communicating about programming; creating an environment where both text and live code can be executed in an explanatory fashion. Parts of this document will contain live Python code that is interpreted by the notebook and whose output will be rendered directly to the screen. If you would like to follow along on your laptop, you can install iPython and download this workbook from [github/intro-to-python](https://github.com/bbengfort/intro-to-python)."

Obviously we're not going to make you an expert programmer in this time, nor are we going to impart a comprehensive theory of programming. However, there is one fundamental concept about programming that I would like ensure you all take away: **programming isn't about knowing syntax it's about learning**.

      "Now that we have covered the basic building blocks of a Python program, let's discuss a programming paradigm called Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP gives programmers a framework for modeling the real world by using classes - templates that describe an object's methods and attributes. Using this methodology, a programmer simply has to imagine the component interactions of the structure they're trying to model, then translate that into the executional components described above. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Some Terminology**:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Class**: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.\n",
      "* **Class variable**: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables aren't used as frequently as instance variables are.\n",
      "* **Data member**: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.\n",
      "* **Function overloading**: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects (arguments) involved.\n",
      "* **Instance variable**: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
      "* **Inheritance** : The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.\n",
      "* **Instance**: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.\n",
      "* **Instantiation** : The creation of an instance of a class.\n",
      "* **Method** : A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.\n",
      "* **Object** : A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.\n",
      "* **Operator overloading**: The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator."
