      "I am very sorry to say that because professor is very patient and expert. But the course is a real mess in which I had great difficulties to understand what are the things to learn. \n",
      "Well. That’s not what I expected. It was not structured enough, I missed theory and general organization of classes.\n",
      "Content were not in depth. I understand hands-on sessions but concept should be explained before on board properly. Unfortunately it wasn't done for most of the concepts.\n",
      "The name of the class is \"Software Engineering\" so I expected a more general class (i.e. higher level software engineering rather than 90% coding).\n",

      "For the exercises, I think he could prepare the solutions in advance before the class instead of trying out the codes in class.\n",
      "I already had an understanding of most of the concepts covered which helped a lot, I think without this I would have struggled as the class lacked structure and was at times confusing. \n",
      "In general, the module seemed unstructured and unclear, as well as inefficiently planned.\n",
      "The class was unfortunately a bit \"messy\" and hard to follow.\n",
      "No organisation\n",
      "It was a little anarchy.. \n",
      "The course was confusing, it was meant to be an introduction for beginners in C/C++ langage but was conducted as if we had already a background in this subject. Asking to code solutions to exercices on our own without properly defining commands structures was quite frustrating. It would have been better to do the exercices together with the teacher commenting line by line the commands used, what are the variables required and best practices. Or, at least, doing more theoretical explanation of commands on slides prior to exercice ourselves on software. \n",
      "the syllabus indicated that we would practice some of the features seen in C during the day, in Python  during personal work, which hasn't been triggered at all by the teacher. The C++ part has been done in 4 hours on friday afternoon\n",
      "There is no preparation and planning for course. I've to follow and learn everything on my own. Complete waste of time. \n",
      "The professor might be experienced, but he has no pedagogy and came unprepared the whole time. He wasted a lot of time figuring out where are the errors while he should've already prepared a second cleaner version of his code as a reference. He also didn't prepare good explanations for concepts and algorithms and was just coding them before our eyes to see. \n",
      "This class did not meet my expectation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clement came teaching without any slides, preparation, instruction, guideline beforehand that make the course become extremely messy and difficult to follow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clement often left us alone for 1 hour to work with exercises. This approach creat a \"blank moment\" with lack of communication does not make a win for students, either for DSTI, especially on Monday where we had some external audiences for a demonstration. \n",
      "\n",
      "Monday's exercise solutions were not uploaded in the Moodle as mentioned at the end of the courses. We could not find anything until the next morning. Instead of moving forward to learn the new things, we went back to the point which supposed to be done and Clement was using this time to code the solution in front of us.\n",
      " The class falls short on all expectations.\n",
      "the class covers C and the way it works so yeah it is software engineering\n",
      "The Class met my expectation and i did learnt a lot about pointers and  memory allocation.\n",
      "Very good introduction to C language (and C++). \n",
      "It was a good overview of C but he did not explain very well what he was doing/why he was doing it\n",
      "it was light and fun actually \n",
      "I ,as a beginner of C Programming, spend quite a time just to build an environment for writing a code and make my console functional. Although Clément gave the instruction in the class, it would be nice to have an instruction such as which packages should we download with and how IDE(Visual Studio) works with C programming language. The class starts with the history of C and right after that, coding part starts. This seems not to be seamless for me. \n",
      "It covered the core concepts of Software Engineering, yet I think it needed more time and there some another topics to be covered though. \n"
