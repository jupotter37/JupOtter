    "Overview\n",
    "On the 26th of september 2024,the topic Github control was taught in the course python prohramming language by Dr.Yae Gaba. In this course, I learned the fundamental principles and terminology of Revision Control Systems (RCS), focusing primarily on Git, a distributed version control system. We also briefly touched upon other systems like Mercurial, but our main emphasis was on Git due to its widespread use and powerful features.\n",

Execute each code cell and follow the instructions to understand how to manage version control locally. Experiment with commands, make changes, and observe how they affect your repository.

    "What is Version Control ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, revision control systems (RCS) are essential tools. They are widely used across all development environments and by developers everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "RCS are versatile and not limited to just software projects; they are also invaluable for managing various types of digital content, including manuscripts, figures, data, and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revision control systems (RCS) serve two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Track Changes in Source Code:\n",
    "        Enable tracking and managing changes to the source code.\n",
    "        Allow reverting to previous versions if issues arise.\n",
    "        Support working on multiple \"branches\" of the software at the same time.\n",
    "        Use tags to identify and manage different versions, such as \"release-1.0\" or \"paper-A-final.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Facilitate Collaborative Development:\n",
    "        Allow multiple contributors to work on the same codebase simultaneously.\n",
    "        Enable numerous authors to make and integrate changes.\n",
    "        Provide clear communication and visualization of changes to all team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Principles and Terminology of Revision Control Systems (RCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an RCS, source code or digital content is managed within a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Repository: Stores not only the latest version of files but also the complete history of all changes made to these files since their initial addition to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Checkout: Users obtain a local working copy of the files from the repository. Changes are made to these local files, allowing for additions, deletions, and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Commit: After completing a task, changes made to the local files are saved back to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Conflict Resolution: If changes have been made by others to the same files, conflicts may arise. The system often resolves conflicts automatically, but manual intervention may be necessary to merge conflicting changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Branches and Forks: For larger experimental developments, it’s common to create a new branch, fork, or clone of the repository. The primary branch is usually called master or trunk. Once work on a branch or fork is finished, it can be merged back into the main branch or repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Distributed RCS: Systems like Git or Mercurial allow for pulling and pushing changesets between different repositories. For instance, changes can be pushed from a local repository to a central online repository, such as those hosted on platforms like GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few words, version control is a way to keep a backup of the changes in your files and to store a history of those changes. The key charateristic of VC is that and it allows many people in a collaboration to make changes to the same files concurrently. VC is done via a VC system and there are a lot of them. Wikipedia provides both a nice vocabulary list and a fairly complete table of some popular version control systems and their equivalent commands.\n",
    "Popular Revision Control Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "    Git (git): http://git-scm.com/\n",
    "    Mercurial (hg): http://mercurial.selenic.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this lecture, we will focus on Git. However, Mercurial is equally effective and operates in a very similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using git. Git is an example of a distributed version control system, distinct from centralized versing control systems. I'll not discuss the distinction, but for now, the table below will suffice.\n",

    "Let's recall the behavior of the linux diff command on the command line. The equivalent command for windows is fc. Choosing two files that are similar, the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "$!diff file1 file2\n",
    "\n",
    "will output the lines that differ between the two files. This information can be saved as what's known as a patch, but we won't go deeply into that just now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between the command line diff tool and git's diff tool is that the git tool is aware of all of the revisions in your repository, allowing each revision of each file to be treated as a full file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, git diff will output the changes in your working directory that are not yet staged for a commit. To see how this works, make a change in your README.md file, but don't yet commit it.\n",
