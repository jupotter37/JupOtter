    "In this section, we expand our knowledge of pandas DataFrames. First, we learn how to add a new column to the DataFrame. Then, we cover how to save the DataFrame as a `csv` file using the `to_csv` method and how to read the csv file back into a DataFrame using the `read_csv` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also delve into more complex operations on DataFrames, such as accessing data using conditions, grouping data by a certain column, and applying functions to columns. These operations are essential for data manipulation and analysis in pandas.\n",

    "Finally, we use the `apply()` method to apply a function to each element in a DataFrame column. This is a powerful tool that allows us to perform complex transformations on our data. In this example, we use a `lambda` function to add 1 to each age in the 'Age' column."
