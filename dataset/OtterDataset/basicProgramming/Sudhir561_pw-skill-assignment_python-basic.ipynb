    "2.\tExplicit Type Casting (Manual Conversion)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another without explicit instruction from the programmer. \n",
    "This usually occurs in operations where a smaller data type is converted into a larger data type to prevent data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 10   # Integer\n",
    "y = 2.5  # Float\n",
    "\n",
    "result = x + y\n",
    "print(\"Result:\", result)         # 12.5\n",
    "print(\"Type of result:\", type(result))  # <class 'float'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "•\tIn the example above, the integer x is automatically converted to a float before the addition operation because y is a float. \n",
    "The result is a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explicit Type Casting\n",

    "6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a given condition is True or False. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are fundamental to controlling the flow of a program, allowing it to make decisions and respond differently under various circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Conditional Statements in Python:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.\tif statement\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tif-else statement\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tif-elif-else statement\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tNested conditional statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. if Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The if statement is the most basic form of conditional statement. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition\n",
    "is True.\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "    \n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is True\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "The code inside the if block runs only if the condition age >= 18 evaluates to True. Since age is 18, \n",
    "the message \"You are eligible to vote.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. if-else Statement\n",
    "The if-else statement allows you to define an alternative block of code that will run if the condition is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "    \n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is True\n",

    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation:\n",

    "•\tSince the condition age >= 18 is False (because age is 16), the code inside the else block is executed,\n",
    "printing \"You are not eligible to vote.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t3. if-elif-else Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tThe if-elif-else statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check. The elif keyword stands for \"else if\" and\n",
    "allows you to check additional conditions if the previous ones are False.\n",

    "    \n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition1 is True\n",
    "    \n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition2 is True\n",
    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # code to execute if all conditions are False\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "marks = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "if marks >= 90:\n",

    "    \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: D\")\n",

    "4. Nested Conditional Statements\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer if checks if the age is 18 or older. If it is True, the inner if checks the citizenship. \n",

    "7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples\n",

    "1. while Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is True. \n",
    "It is useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and the loop should continue until a specific condition changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "    \n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # code to be executed\n",
    "    \n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "•\tThe loop runs as long as count is less than 5. In each iteration, the value of count is printed and then incremented by 1.\n",
    "The loop stops when count reaches 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "•\tThe while loop is ideal for scenarios where you need to keep looping until a condition changes, \n",
    "such as waiting for user input or processing elements until a certain state is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. for Loop\n",
    "The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and \n",
    "execute a block of code for each element in the sequence. It is ideal when you know the number of iterations ahead of time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "    \n",
    "•\tThe for loop is commonly used for iterating over sequences like lists, tuples, and strings,\n",

    "3. Nested Loops\n",
