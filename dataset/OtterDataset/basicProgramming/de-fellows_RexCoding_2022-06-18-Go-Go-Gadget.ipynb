    "### 1.1: A Brief Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Phase 1 we need to get the Raspberry Pi 4 up and running. Unlike the computers in your phone, laptop or smartwatch, Raspberry Pi computers do not come with a built-in Operating System (OS). This means you need to do it yourself, by putting the OS on a microSD card using your own computer and then inserting the microSD into the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to do this. For a Raspberry Pi 4, you can use the New Out of Box Software (NOOBS) method, or the Raspberry Pi Imager method. We will be using the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to have some sort of an adapter for your microSD card, since most laptops or computers do not have that kind of port. Some options are a microSD to USB adapter or a microSD to SD card adapter. The important part is that you have some way of connecting the microSD to your computer. I am using an ADATA microReader, because it is what I had on hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.2: Checking the File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Raspberry Pi’s require your microSD card to be in FAT32 file format. This is the default format for SD cards with 32GB or less storage capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your microSD card is 32GB or less, congratulations! You can move on to section 1.3.\n",

    "If your microSD card is greater than 32GB, you will need to convert it to FAT32. Both Windows and Mac have options for this that can be found with a simple Google search. Once this is completed, move on to section 1.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3: Flashing the microSD Card\n",
