    "\n",
    "-   Python syntax and basic rules\n",
    "-   Variables and how to use them\n",
    "-   Different data types\n",
    "-   Operators and their magic\n",
    "-   Real-world applications\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Python Syntax: The Grammar of Code 📝\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is known for its clean and readable syntax. Let’s see some basic\n",
    "rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# This is a comment - Python ignores everything after #\n",
    "print(\"Hello, Python Learner!\")  # Comments can also be at the end of lines\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python uses indentation for code blocks\n",
    "if True:\n",
    "    print(\"This line is indented\")  # Notice the 4 spaces/1 tab\n",
    "print(\"This line is not indented\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple statements in one line (not recommended but possible)\n",
    "print(\"First\"); print(\"Second\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Long line split into multiple lines using \\\n",
    "long_text = \"This is a very long line of code that \\\n",
    "            continues on the next line\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Practice: Fix the Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Try to fix these syntax errors!\n",
    "# Uncomment and run each line separately\n",
    "\n",
    "#print \"Hello\"  # What's missing?\n",
    "#if True\n",
    "#    print(\"Indented\")\n",
    "#print(\"Multiple\" print(\"prints\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Variables: Storing Data 📦\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are like containers that store data. Python makes it easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Basic variable assignment\n",
    "name = \"Python Learner\"\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "height = 1.75\n",
    "is_student = True\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple assignment\n",
    "x, y, z = 1, 2, 3\n",

    "# 1invalid = \"Bad\"  # Can't start with number\n",
    "camelCase = \"Valid but not Python convention\"\n",
    "snake_case = \"Python's preferred naming style\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Practice: Create Your Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "# Create variables for your profile\n",
    "your_name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "your_age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "your_favorite_number = float(input(\"Enter your favorite number: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate some fun facts\n",
    "days_lived = your_age * 365\n",
