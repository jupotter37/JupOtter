To get a better headstart, you must represent your online course brand and strike a balance between visitors and conversions. Here are some best practices for designing an effective landing page to promote an online course. A. Mobile Responsiveness A course landing page is a specific web page dedicated to promoting and selling an online course. It typically includes key elements such as a header, pricing, social proof, video testimonials, a call-to-action (CTA), and an FAQ section. Ultimately, the main goal of a course landing page is to generate leads and convert them to paying customers ...\n",
            "\u001b[00m\n",
            "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mFinal Answer: To create a beautiful and effective landing page for Edukey's MS SQL trainer-led database course for corporate employees, it is essential to integrate several best practices based on comprehensive research. The landing page should be designed with the following elements in mind:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the landing page is fully responsive and optimized for all devices. Given the high likelihood of corporate employees accessing the page on various devices, including smartphones and tablets, a mobile-first approach will ensure a wider reach and better user experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clean Design and Powerful Copy:** Adopt a clean, clutter-free design that focuses on the course's value proposition. Use powerful, reaction-inducing copy that presents potential customers with a problem (e.g., the need for advanced MS SQL skills in the corporate world) and offers Edukey's course as the solution.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Concise Layout with Strategic CTAs:** The page layout should be concise, directing visitors' attention to critical information about the course. Include Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons strategically placed after every section to prompt immediate action, such as signing up or requesting more information.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Key Elements Inclusion:** Incorporate essential elements specific to online course landing pages, including:\n",
            "   - A compelling header that captures attention and clearly states the course's benefit.\n",
            "   - Pricing information that is straightforward and offers clear value.\n",
            "   - Social proof, such as testimonials from past participants or endorsements from reputable corporate clients, to build credibility.\n",
            "   - Video content, such as testimonials or a course preview, to engage visitors and provide a tangible sense of the course's content and delivery.\n",
            "   - An FAQ section addressing common concerns and questions, reducing barriers to sign-up.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Highlight Unique Selling Points (USPs):** Clearly communicate the USPs of Edukey's MS SQL course, such as its focus on corporate employees, the expertise of trainers, and any unique course features (e.g., real-world project experience, personalized coaching, etc.) that set it apart from competitors.\n",
            "\n",

            "context: The landing page should be fully responsive and optimized for all devices. It should adopt a clean, clutter-free design that focuses on the course's value proposition. The layout should be concise, directing visitors' attention to critical information about the course. Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons should be strategically placed after every section to prompt immediate action. Essential elements specific to online course landing pages should be incorporated, including a compelling header, straightforward pricing information, social proof, video content, and an FAQ section. The USPs of Edukey's MS SQL course should be clearly communicated, such as its focus on corporate employees, the expertise of trainers, and any unique course features. The landing page should be designed with lead generation in mind. A form that is easy to complete should be included, asking for essential contact details. The landing page should communicate that Edukey exists to empower corporate employees with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the modern data-driven world. The landing page should demonstrate that Edukey achieves its mission through a unique blend of expert-led training, practical hands-on exercises, and real-world project experience. The landing page should clearly outline that Edukey offers a comprehensive MS SQL trainer-led database course specifically tailored for corporate employees. The landing page should use the Golden Circle Communication technique, starting with the 'Why', followed by the 'How', and finally the 'What'. This will resonate with potential customers by connecting with their values, demonstrating the effectiveness and uniqueness of Edukey's approach, and clearly outlining the tangible benefits and features of the course. The overall design of the landing page should be clean and professional, with a focus on the course's value proposition. The color scheme should be calming and trustworthy, using shades of blue and white. The typography should be clear and easy to read, using a modern sans-serif font. The layout should be simple and straightforward, with clearly defined sections for each element of the Golden Circle Communication technique. The landing page should also include high-quality images and videos related to the course, as well as testimonials from past participants. The landing page structure is designed to engage corporate clients by clearly communicating the value of the MS SQL course, addressing common concerns, and making the registration process as easy as possible. The code should start with a Header with responsive menu (also as a mobile hamburger menu) and end with a Footer will all elements and copywriting provided. Use Responsive Design and Mobile First when possible. Use React best practices and naming conventions. Save the file as with `.tsx` extension. NEVER FORGET TO CLOSE THE FINAL BRACKET (}) or tag `>` in the file. NEVER import custom components without providing their code in output code. NEVER provide a list of suggestions, checkpoints, examples or ideas as an output, YOU MUST PROVIDE WORKING CODE, NOTHING ELSE! Final answer MUST BE ONLY a valid Typescript Code with Tailwind classes and custom css. Make sure code starts with Header with Nav and ends with Footer, and that we use semantic HTML 5. Provide all sections between Header and Footer. Make sure we have all copy written, like full trainer description, full course program, full FAQ section. Not only examples. You MUST export whole code to one file. But you SHOULD create multiple components in this file. You can import existing UI Libraries when possible, like Radix UI library, for example: import '@radix-ui/themes/styles.css'; import Theme, Button from '@radix-ui/themes' @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-tooltip.\u001b[0m\n",

If you don't have code provided, try to write it from scratch based on all data you have. make sure code starts with Header with Nav and ends with Footer, and that we use semantic HTML 5. Provide all sections between Header and Footer. make sure we have all copy written, like full trainer description, full course program, full FAQ section. Not only examples.
