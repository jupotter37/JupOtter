Still, this is something that pops up quite a lot on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/890128/how-are-lambdas-useful) threads and in other communities. And, if you ever have the urge to delve into [functional programming with Python](https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/), you will learn to absolutely love lambda expressions.\n",

    "+ [Python learning path from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/beginner-python/): This learning path is appropriate for beginners that have no problem using Microsoft-supplied tools, most notably Visual Studio Code. While sign-up is not required, it is useful to get access to interactive coding sandboxes. **If you have time for only one follow-up, complete this learning path.**\n",
    "+ [Python intro course by Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110): Interactive introductory lessons from Udacity. While free of charge, you will need to provide some personal data to get started. **The Udacity course will go through much the same topics as this notebook, but with more patience.**\n",
    "+ [Official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial): The official Python tutorial covers key concepts rather systematically, but not always in an easy-to-follow manner.\n",
    "+ [Python tutorial from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp): Similar to the official Python tutorial, but more accessible since it provides examples that are more to the point - with a slight bias towards topics relevant for data scientists.\n",
    "+ [Python reference documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/): Here, you will find authoritative documentation on the Python language and its standard library. As an added benefit, the documentation collects also how-tos, FAQs and setup instructions. If you are looking for design explanations, head over to the [PEP](https://peps.python.org/) repository.\n",
