Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.\n",

            "\"[\\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"He scored twice in the last group match, a 3\\\\\\\\u20132 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[423] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1\\\\\\\\u20130 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1\\\\\\\\u20130 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[424][425] Following a 0\\\\\\\\u20130 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4\\\\\\\\u20132 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[426]\\\\\\\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[427] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[582] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[583][584][585] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"more one of the group, more Argentine\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[581]\\\\\\\\nComparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\\\\\\\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali\\\\\\\\u2013Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer\\\\\\\\u2013Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost\\\\\\\\u2013Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[586][587]\\\\\\\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[588][589] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[160] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[590] seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[591] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[160][592] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1\\\\\\\\u20130 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi's record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002\\\\\\\\u201303 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe's top-five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace in a 5\\\\\\\\u20130 away win against Alav\\\\\\\\u00e9s in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\\\\\\\\u00e9 Altafini's record from the 1962\\\\\\\\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\\\\\\\\u00fcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\\\\\\\\u00e9sar Rodr\\\\\\\\u00edguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\\\\\\\nDespite Messi's individual form, Barcelona's four-year cycle of success under Guardiola \\\\\\\\u2013 one of the greatest eras in the club's history \\\\\\\\u2013 drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alc\\\\\\\\u00e1ntara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Cl\\\\\\\\u00e1sico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di St\\\\\\\\u00e9fano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atl\\\\\\\\u00e9tico Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://olympics.com/en/athletes/lionel-messi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\u201cThe Olympic gold in 2008 is the win that I value the most because it is a tournament that you may play only once in your life and involves many athletes from different disciplines\\\\\\\\u201d - Lionel Messi, Spanish Esquire\\\\\\\\nFeatured\\\\\\\\nLatest News\\\\\\\\nOlympic Results\\\\\\\\nAthlete Olympic Results Content\\\\\\\\nYou may like Lionel MESSI\\\\\\\\nBiography\\\\\\\\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina in 1987 Lionel Messi is widely held to be one of the greatest football players of his generation \\\\\\\\u2014 and with good reason.\\\\\\\\n Graduating quickly through the club\\\\\\\\u2019s ranks thanks to his ever-growing skill set Messi made his first senior appearance for the club at the age of 17.\\\\\\\\n When he eventually left the team in 2021 for French club Paris Saint-Germain the Argentine completed his time in La Liga as its top goal-scorer, with an eye-watering 474 successful shots to his name.\\\\\\\\n He also came close to winning the FIFA World Cup in 2014 but Argentina fell to Germany 1-0 in the final.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"}\\\", \\\"{\\\\\\\"url\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"content\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"He told the court he \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"only played football\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and didn't know anything because he left his money problems to be dealt with by his father, Jorge Messi.[23]\\\\\\\\nClub career statistics[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nInternational career statistics[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nHonours[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nClub[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nBarcelona[26]\\\\\\\\nInternational[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nArgentina U20\\\\\\\\nArgentina Olympic team\\\\\\\\nArgentina Senior team\\\\\\\\nIndividual[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nNotes[change | change source]\\\\\\\\nReferences[change | change source] He scored his first hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a 3-1 victory against Switzerland in February 2012.[17]\\\\\\\\nOn 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by scoring his 55th goal with a gem of a free-kick against the United States in the Copa Am\\\\\\\\u00e9rica Centenario. In an emotional interview after the game, he said he was very sad that he missed the penalty and also sad that he wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals.[18][19][20]\\\\\\\\nHe came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.\\\\\\\\n On 18 April 2007, he scored a goal almost exactly identical to Maradona's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Goal of the Century\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" against England in the 1986 World Cup, where Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side and beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score.
