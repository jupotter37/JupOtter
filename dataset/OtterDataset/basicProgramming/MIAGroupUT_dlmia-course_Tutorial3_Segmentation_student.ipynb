    "In this part of the tutorial, you will train a convolutional neural network for automatic segmentation of ribs in a chest X-ray image. You will examine the effects of using different loss functions, data augmentations and network architectures. To keep track of all these parameters, we will use wandb.\n",

    "### Build a CacheDataset\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the notebook, you defined the path to the rib data. We will now use it to find and load the corresponding images.\n",
    "The data consists of an image and a label. However, the label is in this case not a binary label, but a segmentation mask. Both the segmentation masks and the X-rays are .png files and can be opened using the PIL library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we are not going to code the Dataset class ourselves but instead use a Monai class: [`CacheDataset`](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/data.html#cachedataset). It has two main advantages:\n",
    "- as the name suggests, it uses a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) mechanism, which means that it is memory efficient (this is partly explained later).\n",
    "- everything is pre-built, so no need to code the `__init__`, `__getitem__` and `__len__` functions anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "`CacheDataset` only needs the list of your data samples to work. As we are learning a segmentation task, one data sample is composed of two images: the chest X-ray (named `img`) and the mask of the ribs (named `mask`). With Python, we represent this data sample with a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yLI4sJz.png\" alt=\"sample\" width=\"450\"/>\n",

    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/r7JJTgY.png\" alt=\"list of samples\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as this list contains all the images, it means that all the images are always in Python memory even though they are not currently used so this is very inefficient. This is why we don't directly give  the images to `CacheDataset`, but the paths to find them on our disk. Then we also need to give a `Transform` object, `LoadRibData` which will transform these paths into the corresponding images only when they are needed.\n",

    "As we don't want to write this list of paths manually, we write the function `build_dict_ribs` which automatically computes it based on the root folder of the data directory `data_path`. This is possible because fortunately your teachers pre-organized the dataset for this tutorial, but be aware that most medical datasets require a lot of cleaning up prior to this."

Monai offers a wide range of different [loss functions](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/losses.html) that are also suitable for segmentation. In this tutorial, we will also assess the effects of using different loss functions on our network performance.\n",

The Dice loss is computed over the full mini-batch (`batch=True`) to avoid poorly defined loss in individual batch samples. This means that, in a sense, we compute the Dice loss in a 3D stack of 2D images."

Though this is an essential step when developping and debugging a network, this step is also quite subjective, and tedious when there are a lot of images. This is why we need metrics to evaluate the performance of our network! These metrics give us a quantity that represents the performance of our network and enable comparison to other methods.\n",
