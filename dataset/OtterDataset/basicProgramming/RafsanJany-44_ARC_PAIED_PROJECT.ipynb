        "Python is an interpreter-based, powerful full-programming language. Python is very popular for its simplicity and worldwide developer community. Guido van Rossum designed it between 1985 and 1990. Python programming is used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, web development, etc. It’s an object-oriented programming language. The libraries are very extensive and well supported by the community. The simplicity of this language makes it more friendly to the beginner programmer. \n",

        "An IDE is an integrated development environment where developers have all the tools with a graphical interface for developing. For Python programming, there are lots of IDEs, such as PyCharm, Spider, Jupiter NoteBook, etc. For this project, I have used Jupiter NoteBook. Jupiter NoteBook is a very powerful IDE for Python development. The most advantageous feature of this IDE is that it provides block or section-wise execution and saves each instance. So the result can be found after execution. Another advantage is that any software is not needed for this. Jupiter NoteBook can be run in any browser. Jupiter NoteBook is easily customisable and shareable.\n",

        "Python has a large and extended community of developers. This made this language very user-friendly. Any beginner programmer can get any kind of help from this community. So there are always people around them to help with programming. The libraries are vast and easy to import and use. The syntax are easy to implement. Python provides clear readability to its users. So, the code is written in Python and is clean to be understood.\n",

        "In this project a mathematical game is asked to be implemented with Python where user will chose the arithmetic and the number of questions. Then the code will generate a list size of 50. The list will contain random number of 0 to 10000. The program will select two number randomly and an arithmetic. Then it will show it to the user and ask for the correct answer. The user will give the answer and program will check it. If the answer is wrong then the program will show the correct answer with an appropriate message. If the answer is correct than the program will show a relevant message. This is a basic structure of the game. \n",
