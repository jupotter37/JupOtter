An object is considered mutable if its state or value can be modified after it is created. This means that you can alter its internal data or attributes without creating a new object."],"metadata":{"id":"xlRcmfbK5zL7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.6 : Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","Ans : Tuples are an essential data structure in Python, representing an immutable, ordered collection of elements. They are similar to lists but with a key difference: once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. This immutability makes tuples a reliable choice for storing fixed collections of data while lists can be modified."],"metadata":{"id":"Q-_Pmlvj6W8O"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.7 : What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","Ans : The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects.

In such a case, the condition is true."],"metadata":{"id":"lPTnt8hd6-3U"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.8 : What are logical operators in Python ?\n","Ans : Logical operators in Python are keywords that connect and evaluate multiple conditions in a single expression. They are used to: combine conditional statements, express complex conditions, make decisions based on multiple factors, and improve the flexibility and complexity of logical expressions.\n","The three main logical operators in Python are:\n","and: Returns True if both operands are True, and False if either operand is False.\n","or: Returns True if at least one operand is True, and False if neither operand is True.\n","not: Reverses the result, returning False if the result is True."],"metadata":{"id":"6-l63t237TRV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.9 : What is type casting in Python ?\n","Ans : Type Casting is the method to convert the Python variable datatype into a certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users."],"metadata":{"id":"1hgcegpC7p0C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q.10 : What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","Ans : Explicit type conversion in programming is done manually by the programmer, while implicit conversion is handled automatically by the compiler.
