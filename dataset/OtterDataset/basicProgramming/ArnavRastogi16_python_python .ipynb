    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language for several reasons. Here are some key features that make python a preferred choice:\n",
    "       \n",
    "1.*Readability*: Python emphasizes readability and uses simple and clean syntax,making it easier to understand and write code. This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners and experienced programmers alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.*Versatility*: Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web developments, data analysis and more . Its flexibility allows developers to work on diverse projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.*Interpreted Language*: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code execution occurs line by line, allowing for easier debugging and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect that makes Python a popular choice for programming is its strong support for objects-oriented programming priciples. Python allows developers to create reusable and organized code through classes and objects, promoting modularity and code reusability . This OOP supports simplifies complexes problems by breaking tham down into smaller, more manageable components, enhancing code structure and maintainability."

    " ## QUES 5) Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples .\n",
    " \n",
    " In Python, type casting refers to the conversion of one data type to another. This process allows you to change the data type of a variable or value. Here's an explanation of type casting with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.*Implicit Type Conversion*:\n",
    "   -Python automatically converts data types in certain situations, such as when performing operations between different types.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_int = 10\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_float = 5.5\n",

    "   result = num_int + num_float  # Python implicitly converts num_int to a float before performing the addition\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 15.5\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2.*Explicit Type Conversion*:\n",
    "   -You can explicitly convert data types using predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_str = \"50\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_int = int(num_str)  # Convert the string \"50\" to an integer\n",
    "   print(num_int)  # Output: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "   num_float = float(num_int)  # Convert the integer 50 to a float\n",
    "   print(num_float)  # Output: 50.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3.*Type Casting between Different Data Types*:\n",
    "   -You can convert data types between integers, floats, and strings.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_int = 100\n",
    "   \n",
    "   num_str = str(num_int)  # Convert the integer 100 to a string\n",

    "   print(num_float)  # Output: 100.0\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4.*Handling Errors during Type Casting*:\n",
    "   -Type casting can raise errors if the conversion is not possible (e.g., converting a string that is not a number to an integer).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   python\n",
    "   \n",
