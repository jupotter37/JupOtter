    "Ans.In Python memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic.Some of the ways in which Python manages memory:\n",
    "1. Memory Allocation:\n",
    "Whenever a new object is created, Python dynamically allocates memory for it. Python allocates a specific memory space for the object, depending on the object’s type and size. The process of allocating memory for an object is known as memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memory Deallocation:\n",
    "When an object is no longer required, Python deallocates the memory allocated to it. Python has a built-in garbage collector that manages memory deallocation automatically. The garbage collector frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use and not referenced by any other part of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reference Counting:\r\n",
    "Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects in memory. Every object has a reference count associated with it that keeps track of the number of references to that object. The reference count is incremented whenever a new reference to an object is created and decremented whenever a reference is deleted. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the object is no longer in use and can be deallocated.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. Garbage Collection:\r\n",
    "Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. Python’s garbage collector runs periodically to check for objects that are no longer referenced and frees up the memory occupied by them."
