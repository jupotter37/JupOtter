    "\n",
    "8.(5)Helpfulness is that ChatGPT can provide me with definition and examples to help me understand the code. Limitation is that sometimes the code is complicated so that a beginner cannot understand fully. If the code offered by ChatGPT is too high-level, I should understand the code taught in lecture and tutorial first, and then ask ChatGPT to use these code and try to understand it. And I also need to adjust my needs based on my current level and performance, and ask ChatGPT to adjust the answer appropriately.\n",
