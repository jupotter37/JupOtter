    "Welcome to Hill Thesis Survey Analysis Part A! In this lab, we will introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks, the Python programming language and the tools that you are going to use to conduct your data cleaning and exploration analysis on the Hill Thesis Survey. In the main part of this notebook, you will work with Hill Thesis Survey dataset using Python and learn basic data cleaning techniques and strategies. By the end of this notebook, you will output a cleaned  dataset that will be used to conduct survey analysis in Part B of this project. \n",

All of the code in this notebook is in a programming language called **Python**. You can select any cell by clicking it once. After a cell is selected, you can navigate the notebook using the up and down arrow keys or by simply scrolling.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning \n",
    "Data is the backbone of data analysis. In order to successfuly analyze data, it must be in a clean and easily interpretable format so that we don't run into inconsistencies or errors later in the process. Regarding the survey data, we might encounter non-serious participants (who choose the first answer for all questions), missing values, duplications, and so on. To perform the data analytics properly we need various data cleaning techniques so that our data is ready for analysis. \n",

    "[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling), sometimes referred to as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one \"raw\" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes.\n",

If we're not interested in some information in the original table, too many columns can make the table difficult to read. Thus, obtaining a smaller table containing only the relevant information we need to conduct our analysis is important. \n",

    "In our dataset, there are about 50 questions and 132 columns in the original table. Also, the top two rows are not survey response so we do not want to include them in the table (we showed did this step above!).

Search `Table.exclude()` in the [documentation of `exclude`](http://data8.org/datascience/_autosummary/datascience.tables.Table.exclude.html) for more information.\n",
