machines that understand and respond to text or voice data—and respond with text or speech of their own—in much the same way humans do.', 'What is natural language processing?', 'Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.', 'NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.', 'Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.', 'NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time.', 'There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences.', 'But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.', 'NLP tasks', 'Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data.', 'Homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structure—these just a few of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those applications are going to be useful.', \"Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting.\", 'Some of these tasks include the following:', 'Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data.', 'Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions.', 'What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.', 'Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context.', 'Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’', 'Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings  through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context.', \"For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb 'make' in ‘make the grade’ (achieve) vs. ‘make a bet’ (place).\", 'Named entity recognition, or NEM, identifies words or phrases as useful entities.', \"NEM identifies ‘Kentucky’ as a location or ‘Fred’ as a man's name.\", 'Co-reference resolution is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity.', \"The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (e.g., ‘she’ = ‘Mary’),  but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or an idiom in the text  (e.g., an instance in which 'bear' isn't an animal but a large hairy person).\", 'Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities—attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion—from text.', \"Natural language generation is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it's the task of putting structured information into human language.\", 'See the blog post “NLP vs. NLU vs. NLG: the differences between three natural language processing concepts” for a deeper look into how these concepts relate.', 'NLP tools and approaches', 'Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)', 'The Python programing language provides a wide range of tools and libraries for attacking specific NLP tasks.', 'Many of these are found in the Natural Language Toolkit, or NLTK, an open source collection of libraries, programs, and education resources for building NLP programs.', 'The NLTK includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, plus libraries for subtasks, such as sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that help the computer better understand the text).', 'It also includes libraries for implementing capabilities such as semantic reasoning, the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.', 'Statistical NLP, machine learning, and deep learning', \"The earliest NLP applications were hand-coded, rules-based systems that could perform certain NLP tasks, but couldn't easily scale to accommodate a seemingly endless stream of exceptions or the increasing volumes of text and voice data.\", 'Enter statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements.', \"Today, deep learning models and learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable NLP systems that 'learn' as they work and extract ever more accurate meaning from huge volumes of raw, unstructured, and unlabeled text and voice data sets.\", 'For a deeper dive into the nuances between these technologies and their learning approaches, see “AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?”', 'NLP use cases', 'Natural language processing is the driving force behind machine intelligence in many modern real-world applications.', 'Here are a few examples:', \"Spam detection: You may not think of spam detection as an NLP solution, but the best spam detection technologies use NLP's text classification capabilities to scan emails for language that often indicates spam or phishing.\", 'These indicators can include overuse of financial terms, characteristic bad grammar, threatening language, inappropriate urgency, misspelled company names, and more.', \"Spam detection is one of a handful of NLP problems that experts consider 'mostly solved' (although you may argue that this doesn’t match your email experience).\", 'Machine translation: Google Translate is an example of widely available NLP technology at work.', 'Truly useful machine translation involves more than replacing words in one language with words of another.', 'Effective translation has to capture accurately the meaning and tone of the input language and translate it to text with the same meaning and desired impact in the output language.', 'Machine translation tools are making good progress in terms of accuracy.', 'A great way to test any machine translation tool is to translate text to one language and then back to the original.', 'An oft-cited classic example: Not long ago, translating “The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak” from English to Russian and back yielded “The vodka is good but the meat is rotten.”', 'Today, the result is “The spirit desires, but the flesh is weak,” which isn’t perfect, but inspires much more confidence in the English-to-Russian translation.', \"Virtual agents and chatbots: Virtual agents such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa use speech recognition to recognize patterns in voice commands and natural language generation to respond with appropriate action or helpful comments.\", 'Chatbots perform the same magic in response to typed text entries.', 'The best of these also learn to recognize contextual clues about human requests and use them to provide even better responses or options over time.', 'The next enhancement for these applications is question answering, the ability to respond to our questions—anticipated or not—with relevant and helpful answers in their own words.', 'Social media sentiment analysis: NLP has become an essential business tool for uncovering hidden data insights from social media channels.', 'Sentiment analysis can analyze language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and events–information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more.', \"Text summarization: Text summarization uses NLP techniques to digest huge volumes of digital text and create summaries and synopses for indexes, research databases, or busy readers who don't have time to read full text.\", 'The best text summarization applications use semantic reasoning and natural language generation (NLG) to add useful context and conclusions to summaries.', 'Natural language processing and IBM Watson', 'IBM has innovated in the artificial intelligence space by pioneering NLP-driven tools and services that enable organizations to automate their complex business processes while gaining essential business

popular natural language project is CoreNLP from Stanford.', 'Also quite academic, albeit powerful, though CoreNLP can be challenging to integrate with other software for production use.', 'Then a few years ago everything in this natural language corner of the world began to change.', 'The two principal authors for spaCy, Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani, launched the project in 2015 and industry adoption was rapid.', \"They focused on an opinionated approach (do what's needed, do it well, no more, no less) which provided simple, rapid integration into data science workflows in Python, as well as faster execution and better accuracy than the alternatives.\", 'Based on these priorities, spaCy became sort of the opposite of NLTK.', 'Since 2015, spaCy has consistently focused on being an open-source project (i.e., depending on its community for directions, integrations, etc.) and being commercial-grade software (not academic research).', 'That said, spaCy has been quick to incorporate the SOTA advances in machine learning, effectively becoming a conduit for moving research into industry.', \"It's important to note that machine learning for natural language got a big boost during the mid-2000's as Google began to win international language translation competitions.\", 'Another big change occurred during 2017-2018 when, following the many successes of deep learning, those approaches began to out-perform previous machine learning models.', 'For example, see the ELMo work on language embedding by Allen AI, followed by BERT from Google, and more recently ERNIE by Baidu—in other words, the search engine giants of the world have gifted the rest of us with a Sesame Street repertoire of open-source embedded language models based on deep learning, which is now state of the art (SOTA).', 'Speaking of which, to keep track of SOTA for natural language keep an eye on NLP-Progress and Papers with Code.', 'The use cases for natural language have shifted dramatically over the past two years, after deep learning techniques arose to the fore.', 'Circa 2014, a natural language tutorial in Python might have shown word count or keyword search or sentiment detection and the target use cases were relatively underwhelming.', \"Circa 2019, we're talking about analyzing thousands of documents for vendor contracts in an industrial supply chain optimization...or hundreds of millions of documents for policyholders of an insurance company or gazillions of documents regarding financial disclosures.\", 'More contemporary natural language work tends to be in NLU, often to support the construction of knowledge graphs, and increasingly in NLG where large numbers of similar documents can be summarized at human scale.', 'The spaCy Universe is a great place to check for deep-dives into particular use cases and to see how this field is evolving.', 'Some selections from this \"universe\" include:', 'Blackstone – parsing unstructured legal texts', 'Kindred – extracting entities from biomedical texts (e.g., Pharma)', 'mordecai – parsing geographic information', 'Prodigy – human-in-the-loop annotation for labeling datasets', 'Rasa NLU – Rasa integration for chat apps', 'Also, a couple super new items to mention:', 'spacy-pytorch-transformers to fine-tune (i.e., use transfer learning with) the Sesame Street characters and friends: BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, etc.', 'spaCy IRL 2019 conference – check out videos from the talks!', \"There's so much more we can do with spaCy— hopefully, this tutorial provides an introduction.\", 'We wish you all the best in your

intelligence program in an old computer system.', 'On the other hand, the beneficiary effect of machine learning is unlimited.', 'Natural Language Processing is one of the branches of AI that gives the machines the ability to read, understand, and deliver meaning.', 'NLP has been very successful in healthcare, media, finance, and human resource.', 'The most common form of unstructured data is texts and speeches.', 'It’s plenty but hard to extract useful information.', 'If not, it would take a long time to mine the information.', 'Written text and speech contain rich information.', 'It’s because we, as intelligent beings, use writing and speaking as the primary form of communication.', 'NLP can analyze these data for us and do the task like sentiment analysis, cognitive assistant, span filtering, identifying fake news, and real-time language translation.', 'This article will cover how NLP understands the texts or parts of speech.', 'Mainly we will be focusing on Words and Sequence Analysis.', 'It includes text classification, vector semantic and word embedding, probabilistic language model, sequential labeling, and speech reorganization.', 'We will look at the sentiment analysis of fifty thousand IMDB movie reviewer.', 'Our goal is to identify whether the review posted on the IMDB site by its user is positive or negative.', 'Topic List', 'Understand what

'Performing Semantic Analysis on IMDB movie review data project', 'NLP has widely used in cars, smartphones, speakers, computers, websites, etc.', 'Google Translator usage machine translator which is the NLP system.', 'Google Translator wrote and spoken natural language to desire language users want to translate.', 'NLP helps google translator to understand the word in context, remove extra noises, and build CNN to understand native voice.', 'NLP is also popular in chatbots.', 'Chatbots is very useful because it reduces the human work of asking what customer needs.', 'NLP chatbot cans ask sequential questions like what the user problem is and where to find the solution.', 'Apple and AMAZON have a robust chatbot in their system.', 'When the user asks some questions, the chatbot converts them into understandable phrases in the internal system.', 'It’s call toke.', 'Then token goes into NLP to get the idea of what users are asking.', 'NLP is used in information retrieval (IR).', 'IR is a software program that deals with large storage, evaluation of information from large text documents from repositories.', 'It will retrieve only relevant information.', 'For example, it is used in google voice detection to trim unnecessary words.', 'Application of NLP', 'Machine Translation i.e. Google Translator', 'Information retrieval', 'Question Answering i.e. ChatBot', 'Summarization', 'Sentiment Analysis', 'Social Media Analysis', 'Mining large data\\\\', 'Words and Sequences', 'NLP system needs to understand text, sign, and semantic properly.', 'Many methods help the NLP system to understand text and symbols.', 'They are text classification, vector semantic, word embedding, probabilistic language model, sequence labeling, and speech reorganization.', 'Text classification', 'Text clarification is the process of categorizing the text into a group of words.', 'By using NLP, text classification can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of predefined tags or categories based on its context.', 'NLP is used for sentiment analysis, topic detection, and language detection.', 'There is mainly three text classification approach-', 'Rule-based System,', 'Machine System', 'Hybrid System.', 'In the rule-based approach, texts are separated into an organized group using a set of handicraft linguistic rules.', 'Those handicraft linguistic rules contain users to define a list of words that are characterized by groups.', 'For example, words like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson would be categorized into politics.', 'People like LeBron James and Ronaldo would be categorized into sports.', 'Machine-based classifier learns to make a classification based on past observation from the data sets.', 'User data is prelabeled as tarin and test data.', 'It collects the classification strategy from the previous inputs and learns continuously.', 'Machine-based classifier usage a bag of a word for feature extension.', 'Source', 'In a bag of words, a vector represents the frequency of words in a predefined dictionary of a word list.', 'We can perform NLP using the following machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayer, SVM, and Deep Learning.', 'The third approach to text classification is the Hybrid Approach.', 'Hybrid approach usage combines a rule-based and machine Based approach.', 'Hybrid based approach usage of the rule-based system to create a tag and use machine learning to train the system and create a rule.', 'Then the machine-based rule list is compared with the rule-based rule list.', 'If something does not match on the tags, humans improve the list manually.', 'It is the best method to implement text classification', 'Vector Semantic', 'Vector Semantic is another way of word and sequence analysis.', 'Vector semantic defines semantic and interprets words meaning to explain features such as similar words and opposite words.', 'The main idea behind vector semantic is two words are alike if they have used in a similar context.', 'Vector semantic divide the words in a multi-dimensional vector space.', 'Vector semantic is useful in sentiment analysis.', 'Source', 'Word Embedding', 'Word embedding is another method of word and sequence analysis.', 'Embedding translates spares vectors into a low-dimensional space that preserves semantic relationships.', 'Word embedding is a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.', 'There are two types of word embedding-', 'Word2vec', 'Doc2Vec.', 'Word2Vec is a statistical method for effectively learning a standalone word embedding from a text corpus.', 'Source', 'Doc2Vec is similar to Doc2Vec, but it analyzes a group of text like pages.', 'Source', 'Probabilistic Language Model', 'Another approach to word and sequence analysis is the probabilistic language model.', 'The goal of the probabilistic language model is to calculate the probability of a sentence of a sequence of words.', 'For example, the probability of the word “a” occurring in a given word “to” is 0.00013131 percent.', 'Source', 'Sequence Labeling', 'Sequence labeling is a typical NLP task that assigns a class or label to each token in a given input sequence.', 'If someone says “play the movie by tom hanks”.', 'In sequence, labeling will be [play, movie, tom hanks].', 'Play determines an action.', 'Movies are an instance of action.', 'Tom Hanks goes for a search entity.', 'It divides the input into multiple tokens and uses LSTM to analyze it.', 'There are two forms of sequence labeling.', 'They are token labeling and span labeling.', 'Parsing is a phase of NLP where the parser determines the syntactic structure of a text by analyzing its constituent words based on an underlying grammar.', 'For example, “tom ate an apple” will be divided into proper noun \\uf0e0 tom, verb \\uf0e0 ate, determiner \\uf0e0 , noun \\uf0e0 apple.', 'The best example is Amazon Alexa.', 'Source', 'We discuss how text is classified and how to divide the word and sequence so that the algorithm can understand and categorize it.', 'In this project, we are going to discover a sentiment analysis of fifty thousand IMDB movie reviewer.', 'Our goal is to identify whether the review posted on the IMDB site by its user is positive or negative.', 'This project covers text mining techniques like Text Embedding, Bags of Words, word context, and other things.', 'We will also cover the introduction of a bidirectional LSTM sentiment classifier.', 'We will also look at how to import a labeled dataset from TensorFlow automatically.', 'This project also covers steps like data cleaning, text processing, data balance through sampling, and train and test a deep learning model to classify text.', 'Parsing', 'Parser determines the syntactic

Language Processing?', 'Computers and machines are great at working with tabular data or spreadsheets.', 'However, as human beings generally communicate in words and sentences, not in the form of tables.', 'Much information that humans speak or write is unstructured.', 'So it is not very clear for computers to interpret such.', 'In natural language processing (NLP), the goal is to make computers understand the unstructured text and retrieve meaningful pieces of information from it.', 'Natural language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence, in which its depth involves the interactions between computers and humans.', 'Applications of NLP:', 'Machine Translation.', 'Speech Recognition.', 'Sentiment Analysis.', 'Question Answering.', 'Summarization of Text.',

'Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP):', 'Figure 1: Revealing, listening, and understand.', 'We, as humans, perform natural language processing (NLP) considerably well, but even then, we are not perfect.', 'We often misunderstand one thing for another, and we often interpret the same sentences or words differently.', 'For instance, consider the following sentence, we will try to understand its interpretation in many different ways:', 'Example 1:', 'Figure 2: NLP example sentence with the text: “I saw a man on a hill with a telescope.”', 'These are some interpretations of the sentence shown above.', 'There is a man on the hill, and I watched him with my telescope.', 'There is a man on the hill, and he has a telescope.', 'I’m on a hill, and I saw a man using my telescope.', 'I’m on a hill, and I saw a man who has a telescope.', 'There is a man on a hill, and I saw him something with my telescope.', 'Example 2:', 'Figure 3: NLP example sentence with the text: “Can you help me with the can?”', 'In the sentence above, we can see that there are two “can” words, but both of them have different meanings.', 'Here the first “can” word is used for question formation.', 'The second “can” word at the end of the sentence is used to represent a container that holds food or liquid.', 'Hence, from the examples above, we can see that language processing is not “deterministic” (the same language has the same interpretations), and something suitable to one person might not be suitable to another.', 'Therefore, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a non-deterministic approach.', 'In other words, Natural Language Processing can be used to create a new intelligent system that can understand how humans understand and interpret language in different situations.', 'Rule-based NLP vs. Statistical NLP:', 'Natural Language Processing is separated in two different approaches:', 'Rule-based Natural Language Processing:', 'It uses common sense reasoning for processing tasks.', 'For instance, the freezing temperature can lead to death, or hot coffee can burn people’s skin, along with other common sense reasoning tasks.', 'However, this process can take much time, and it requires manual effort.', 'Statistical Natural Language Processing:', 'It uses large amounts of data and tries to derive conclusions from it.', 'Statistical NLP uses machine learning algorithms to train NLP models.', 'After successful training on large amounts of data, the trained model will have positive outcomes with deduction.', 'Comparison:', 'Figure 4: Rule-Based NLP
