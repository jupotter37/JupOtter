Currently, this code is being used to run 5 of the same devices, same instructions, but the script is being run separately for each device. The code starts out with system\\_init() and is connected to a Mac address, but I wanted to know if it was possible to define the system\\_init() function with these devices and their Mac addresses to run them all simultaneously? This code is currently being run in Fenics dolfin. I am unsure how the devices are connected to the computer system, I am pretty sure it is by some physical port and not bluetooth. An example of the code I am envisioning looks something like this:\n",
