    "##  Introduction\n",
    "CuPy is an open-source library that implements GPU-accelerated NumPy arrays on CUDA. CuPy represents a GPU version of NumPy. NumPy runs only on CPU cores while CuPy leverages on multiple CUDA cores for parallel execution, therefore, CuPy is considered to run fastest and delivers maximum speed up. Due to the NumPy-compatibility nature of CuPy, almost all NumPy functionalities including multi-dimensional arrays and data types are implemented by CuPy. The rest of this notebook includes simple illustration on `CuPy architecture`, `CuPy fundamentals`, `CuPy CUDA kernels` and, frequently use terms like `Host` (this refers to a CPU), `Device` (means a GPU), and `Kernel` (a CuPy user-defined function that runs on the GPU).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "## CuPy Architecture\n",
    "The CuPy architecture exposes functionalities within the CuPy API that allows developers (or users) to create a user-defined CUDA kernel and make use of deep neural network utility through the `cuDNN` functionality. Linear algebras are solved through `cuBLAS` while systems of equations are solved with `cuSOLVER`. The `cuSPARSE` and `cuTENSOR` API functions specifically target sparse matrix and tensor operations respectively. Random numbers are generated using `cuRAND`. Sort, Scan and Reduction operations are conveniently executed using `CUB` and `Thrust`. Furthermore, Multi-GPU data transfer tasks are initiated with `NCCL` functionality. It is important to know that all these API functionalities rely on `CUDA`, while the CUDA itself depends on the `NVIDIA GPU` as shown in figure 1.0.\n",

    "##  CuPy Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, three frequently used CuPy paradigm namely variable initialization, data transfer, and device selection would be considered. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable or data initialization**: This is the process of assigning data or value to CuPy ndarray. The first step is to import the CuPy library and then initialize variables with data type as follows:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import cupy as cp\n",
    "X1 = cp.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], dtype=cp.int32)#array of 10 values\n",
    "X2 = cp.arange(100, dtype=cp.float32)#generating array of 100 values \n",
    "X3 = cp.empty((3,3), dtype=cp.float32)#initializing empty 2D array of 3X3 matrix\n",
    "Sizebin = 10000\n",
    "X4 = cp.zeros(sizebin, dtype=cp.int64)#initializing array filled with 10,000 zeros\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data transfer**: The idea is to move or copy data from the Host (NumPy) to the Device (CuPy) and vice versa such that data is visible to the Kernel and the resulting output would be copied back to the Host.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import cupy as cp\n",
    "#copy data from Host to Device using cp.asarray()\n",
    "h_X = np.arange(100, dtype=np.float32)#generating array of 100 values on the Host with NumPy\n",
    "d_X = cp.asarray(x)# copy data to Device \n",
    "#copy data from Device to Host using cp.asnumpy()\n",
    "h_X = cp.asnumpy(d_X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Device selection**: This is a mechanism used by CuPy to select a particular GPU or switch from one Device to another (when there are more than one Device, default device is given 0 index id).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Using default Device\n",
    "X1 = cp.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], dtype=cp.int32)\n",

Raw Kernels are written using CUDA C paradigm therefore there is need to understand the memory architecture to know how best to manipulate threads, thread blocks and grid size. This is important to effectively write Raw Kernels that solve complex task.\n",

    "When written codes run on the device (GPU), execution is shared amongst threads and blocks of memory space. The execution could be mapped to thousands of threads modelled in blocks and grids form. This idea is illustrated in figure 3.0 with a view that a thread can be seen as a single executing unit on the device.  A `thread block` (also known as a block) is as collection of threads that can communicate, while a collection of these blocks is referred to as a `Grid`. In several devices the maximum number of threads within a thread block is `1,024` and `65,535` blocks within a grid.\n",

    "A raw kernel runs on the Device and it is defined by creating a `RawKernel` object the embeds CUDA C kernel codes. Let’s illustrate this using example 7 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 7**: Write a CuPy raw kernel program that adds two arrays assume that both arrays contain 10,000 elements each.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Write code body**: To successfully write the kernel code body, it is important to know that computations within CUDA kernels execute in thread blocks and grids in a way that input array elements are accessed using global thread id as index. Therefore, it is necessary to uniquely identify distinct threads. A simple illustration on how to estimate global thread `id(s)` is given in figure 5.0 using four blocks of threads stacked over each other to form a matrix in rows and columns arrangement. Global thread ids are calculated in `x-dimension` (ideally thread block are in x,y,z dimensions) by rearranging the thread blocks as single row and then estimate using statement below:\n",
