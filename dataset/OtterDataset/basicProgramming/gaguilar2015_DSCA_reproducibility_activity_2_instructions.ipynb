    "* Help to standardise python scripts prior to sharing online or with team members.\n",
    "* Introduce pylint as a tool used to standardise this process.\n",

    "## Why do we lint?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to lint code prior to sharing scripts with colleagues or online. There are various approaches to linting code. In this activity, we will be exploring the use of **Pylint**. Some companies such as [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) incorporate linting software as part of their programming style guide. \n",

    "If you use a distribution of **Anaconda**, it is likely that you already have Pylint installed. The [user manual](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is extensive and contains all the information you will need. \n",

    "Pylint can be run from **Anaconda prompt** on Windows or **Terminal** on Mac. From your console type:\n",

By spacing this over two lines, the readability of the script is improved. \n",
