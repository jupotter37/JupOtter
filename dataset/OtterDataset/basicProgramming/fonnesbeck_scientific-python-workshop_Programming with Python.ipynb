As the name implies, object-oriented languages employ objects to create convenient abstractions of data structures. This allows for more flexible programs, fewer lines of code, and a more natural programming paradigm in general. An object is simply a modular unit of data and associated functions, related to the state and behavior, respectively,  of some abstract entity. Object-oriented languages group similar objects into classes. For example, consider a Python class representing a bird:"
