        "-  Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by        Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed to emphasize code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer       lines of code.The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – ‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and       also he wanted    a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python.\n",
