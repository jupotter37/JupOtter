    "The second principle is directly in play: this lie is used *precisely* to keep cognitive load as low as possible. The only way of keeping it lower would be to introduce `import` as a magic statement, and I think that has bigger negative impacts on the later principles.\n",

I'm using this lie to make code re-use and `import` feel both natural and \"what everybody does\": to make the learner feel that they're immediately learning and performing as an expert, as a \"real\" Python programmer. That should give a (minor, but real) feeling that this is an authentic programming task. However, I'm doing that using a carefully constructed lie, and one that could easily fall apart if the student tries something even slightly different. Balancing this is the quandary.\n",

However, for what it's worth, my experience says that there's few good ways of avoiding this issue.\n",

    "You can re-import modules within Python, but the steps are just magic incantations to a beginner, of exactly the sort we wanted to avoid. One approach that avoids this issue is to not mix-and-match scripts and the console. If you start by getting the students to use the console, then switch *entirely* to coding in scripts before introducing the `import` statement. Especially if combined with a good IDE (like `spyder`, which tries to automatically re-import modules where needed), this substantially reduces the issue. I can imagine people internally shouting \"Jupyter notebooks!\" as another solution: I don't think they work for getting beginners comfortable with scripts and `import` in the same way. In the discussion, I will ask for peoples' experience with this issue!"

Thinking here about mathematicians, particularly early undergraduate students or those with less comfort in switching notation, the use of these chained comparisons makes it *much* faster and easier for students to do particular tasks, connects directly to the mathematical notation that they see, re-inforces their identity as mathematicians more, keeps cognitive load lower (as they can directly translate maths notation to code), allows them to tackle interesting problems faster, and so be more generative and productive.\n",

You could also argue that, unless the full suite of comparison operators (like `in`) is covered, and the consequences shown, then we're not being honest - and I believe for most students working at an early *mathematical* level this would cause a massive hit on cognitive load.\n",

Similar thoughts about how it wouldn't generalize to other languages, and it would be too easy to abuse, came up.

    "Here's the sort of thing that Unicode support really helps with. A brief mathematical formula for a decay process uses letters from the Greek alphabet, particularly $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$. We could switch to their latin equivalents, `a` and `l`. However, we're typically using the Greek alphabet because we've run out of latin characters at some point. Equally, explanatory variable names are best, and matching an existing convention clearly good. Particularly with $\\lambda$ converting to the latin equivalent is a problem, as `lambda` is a reserved keyword in Python. It's so much clearer and more Pythonic to be able to use Unicode variable names as done here."

If the random number is less than the probability of a single trial working, then the trial is a success: otherwise the trial is a failure. The comparison `numpy.zeros(...) <= p_colon` does this comparison for every trial in one go. We use `numpy.zeros` to illustrate the method: it means all the trials will succeed.

The sum counts the number of successes, as `True` is converted to one and `False` to zero within the sum, and dividing by the number of trials gives the probability of success.\n",

To some extent this is a problem with the tools: the IDEs, and the fonts, and our expectations. We need to build, and build on, better approaches in the long run. But in the short, we need to watch out for the sort of gotchas this could bring.

    "This is the fourth lie of three, and possibly the hardest to teach, although the concepts are quite easy. It boils down to an implicit assumption behind much of my earlier talk, which was \"Matching existing mathematical notation is good\". This assumed that scientists and mathematicians had settled on the clearest, most expressive notation, and that the job of computing is just to transfer the beauty of mathematics onto the computer so it can do the boring steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I admit, as a professional mathematician, this is definitely my bias. But there's been a lot of push-back from software developers to this viewpoint, and rightly so. To illustrate it, here's three functions, all of which multiply $x$ by $a$. The notational differences between the three are all on the left-hand-side and are tiny: however, to me, as a professional mathematician working in a small sub-field, they indicate large differences.\n",

    "Here is a case where expressing my assumptions in code will actually clarify my mathematical notation. The first function is a function of two variables.

The semi-colon indicates that I should think of the variable $a$ as being fixed within the context of this call. *However*, there may be other contexts where it varies. We are holding $a$ fixed while letting $x$ vary. The point is, there still is, somewhere, a function of two variables $(x, a)$, and in other contexts we may want to use this full function. When expressed in code (in Python, at least) we take our original function $f$ and enforce that $a$ takes a specific value, like 3. The function of two variables is still around, to use if we wish.\n",

    "The third and final function is different again. We're now thinking of $a$ as being fixed in *all* contexts. In this case, there *is no* function of two variables: there is only ever a function of one variable, defined in terms of some constant $a$, presently unspecified. As soon as we specify $a$, enforcing that it takes a specific value like 3, the function of $x$ is fixed. Considering how the function varies as $a$ does *makes no sense*. We can express this in Python using functional tricks: a function takes `a` as input, and returns a function of `x` alone. At no point have we ever defined a function of two variables."
