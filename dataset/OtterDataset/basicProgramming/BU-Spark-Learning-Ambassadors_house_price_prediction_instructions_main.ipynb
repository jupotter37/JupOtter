        "\n",
        "This micro challenge is focused on applying and comparing two machine learning models, Decision Tree and Random Forest, to predict house prices using the Boston house prices dataset. The challenge includes tasks such as loading the dataset, preprocessing data, training both models, and evaluating their performance to determine which model predicts house prices more accurately.\n",

        "**Whatâ€™s the purpose of it:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this challenge is to provide beginner to intermediate machine learning enthusiasts with hands-on experience in applying, comparing, and understanding the performance of different machine learning models on a real-world dataset. It aims to enhance understanding of regression analysis, model selection, and model evaluation metrics within a practical context. This challenge is particularly beneficial for students who have taken introductory courses in data science or machine learning and are looking to apply their knowledge in a practical setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How will the resources help:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommended resources will provide the necessary programming environment to code, test, and compare the Decision Tree and Random Forest models. These platforms support the installation of necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, which contains both machine learning algorithms and the Boston house prices dataset, facilitating an accessible and comprehensive learning experience. Additionally, these environments offer tools for data visualization and analysis, enabling participants to deeply understand model performance and data characteristics\n",
