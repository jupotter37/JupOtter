    "# Lab 1: Introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks with Python Kernel #\n",
    "`Python` is incredibly flexible programming language. It is interpretable hence easy to write and debug. Moreover, hundreds of dozens of packages are available to suit it to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three most important concepts in this lab to learn (from programming point of view) are:\n",
    " - use of `NumPy` package which is designed for scientific computation (somehow like `MatLab` backend);\n",
    " - use of `MatPlotLib` package that can be used to plot any kind of data; and\n",
    " - `Python` programming environment available as a `Jupyter Notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging and help with your code ##\n",
    "The best resource for learning all available features of introduced packages is their documentation. It is available either online:\n",
    "- `NumPy` [here](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html),\n",
    "- `MatPlotLib` [here](http://matplotlib.org/contents.html);\n",
    "\n",
    "or as `Python` enqiry e.g. `help(numpy.matrix)` in `Python` interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python programming language ##\n",
    "The basics of `Python` programming language are available [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three key concepts worth mentioning are:\n",
    "- loose syntax: no need of line end symbol (e.g. `;` in `C`),\n",
    "- importance of code *indentation*: `if` and *loop* block are identified by **indentation**, and\n",
    "- comments are introduced with `#` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Notebook Interpreter ##\n",
    "`Python` can be ran in as a [`Jupyter Notebook`](http://jupyter.org/), previously known as the `IPython Notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter Notebook` is a computing environment which facilitates various programing languages (`Python`, `R`, `Lua`, etc.) through concept of kernels.  \n",
    "In the notebook, you can include multiple cells, which are either complex comments formatted as `Markdown` and $\\LaTeX$ or code segments. Beside it has all features of commandline `ipython` interpreter like *tab auto-completion*.  \n",
    "It is run as a web server with `www` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run `Jupyter Notebook` in the command line/terminal call:\n",
    "``` Bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "now open your favourite web browser and go to: [localhost:8888/notebooks](http://localhost:8888/notebooks). \n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate the folders to where you have downloaded `Lab1_Jupyter.ipynb` file and clik on the file to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important features of the notebook interface are:\n",
    "![Jupyter bar](jupyterBar.png)\n",
    "- <font color=\"red\">Red</font> - insert new cell (above or below currently active one),\n",
    "- <font color=\"blue\">Blue</font> - save your notebook - you can also use `<Ctrl-S>` (the application should save your notebook autoatically once every couple of minutes),\n",
    "- <font color=\"black\">Black</font> - add new cell below currently active one,\n",
    "- <font color=\"green\">Green</font> - **evaluate** the cell and go to the one below - you can also use `<Shift-Return>`,\n",
    "- <font color=\"yellow\">Yellow</font> - select **type** of cell, the two most important are:\n",
    "    - `Code` - `Python` code that can be evaluated,\n",
    "    - `Markdown` - fancy comments and notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To shut down the notebook simply close your browser window and in the terminal window running the backend press `<Ctrl-C>`, type `y`, and press `Return` key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown language (and a bit of $\\LaTeX$ and HTML) ###\n",
    "`Markdown` cells allow you to write fancy and simple comments: all of this is written in `Markdown` - double click on this cell to see the source. Introduction to `Markdown` syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "As `Markdown` is translated to `HTML` upon displaying it also allows you to use pure `HTML` (see the text colour change in the source of this cell): more details are available [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also display simple $\\LaTeX$ equations in `Markdown` thanks to `MathJax` support.  \n",
    "For inline equations wrap your equation between `$` symbols; for display mode equations use `$$`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Creating comments ##\n",
