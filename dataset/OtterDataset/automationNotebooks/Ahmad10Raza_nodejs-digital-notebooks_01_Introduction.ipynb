    "Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, which was traditionally done using languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it efficient and suitable for building scalable network applications."
