    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: to encourage you to move away from writing code in one-off notebooks and towards re-usable modules. But even more importantly, to encourage you to learn good coding practices that will make you a better collaborator. [Meme](img/dalle_meme_of_me.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Key idea: you are already so close to being a good programmer, you just need to make the jump!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever we write code, we care about it ***actually working as expected for ourselves and for others***.\n",
    "    - From that simple premise, I believe that notebooks are bad.\n",
    "- Notebooks encourage bad habits (bad project structure, low re-usability, no testing) and are worse for refactoring code and reproducibility. [Artistic rendition of refactoring](img/code_refactor.png)\n",
    "- Yet there is a *notebook mafia* out there that has been lobbying for the use of notebooks in data science courses both online and on university campuses for years. [DALL-E wouldn't make me a notebook mafia meme](img/chatgpt_reject.png)\n",
    "    - This is producing more and more data scientists and machine learning practitioners that don't write good code.\n",
    "    - This causes a division in many organizations: there are the notebook users and the software engineers. The notebook users (typically with titles like ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù or ‚Äúmachine learning scientist‚Äù) do scrappy work and then toss it over the fence to ‚Äúthe real engineers‚Äù once they have a finding. The real engineers are then tasked with migrating their notebooks to robust modules and scripts. In practice, this requires the engineers to re-write and re-test all of this code and often the code will not work as the notebook user expected!\n",
    "    - We already know that tossing things over the fence doesn‚Äôt work well!\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to highlight the most widely applicable and immediately valuable features for you right now. There are many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who am I to comment on this?\n",
    "- I went through the notebook mafia education system! I took university courses and online classes that do all their assignments in the form of notebooks.\n",
    "- I have been a teaching assistant for classes that use notebooks and I've had to correct and grade hundreds of student submissions in the form of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view me as a survivor or someone who has made it to the other side and escaped the notebook mafia. So I‚Äôm here to tell you what it looks like from the outside. üòá\n",

    "## Joel's talk at JupyterCon 2018\n",
    "Joel Grus (from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence) gave a (now-famous) [1-hour talk](https://youtu.be/7jiPeIFXb6U) with this title at the Jupyter Convention in New York 5 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is very funny and enlightening, you should watch the whole thing! Courtesy to Andrew Beam who originally shared it with me a few years \n",
