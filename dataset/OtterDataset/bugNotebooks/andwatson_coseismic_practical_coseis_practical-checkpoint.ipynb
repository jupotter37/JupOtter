    "## 0. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, the coseismic displacements of more than 100 earthquakes have been captured by InSAR. These range in size from Magnitude ~5 to Magnitude ~8, and have a variety of different mechanisms. Typically, coseismic interferograms are interpreted by comparing the interferograms with the predictions of elastic dislocation models, in which slip occurs on one or more dislocations (fault) in an elastic half space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with the model of Okada (1985), with uniform slip occuring on a rectangular dislocation in an elastic half-space. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the model, including the parameters that you will be able to vary throughout the practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/okada_half_space.png\" style=\"float: centre;\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "*Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the Okada half space model used in this practical.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1)** Produce synthetic displacement maps for strike-slip and normal faulting earthquakes, so as to investigate the underlying structure of the deformation signals produced by different earthquake mechanisms when observed through InSAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2)** Fit a forward model to the March 2021, $M_w$ 6.3 Thessaly Mainshock in Greece.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3)** Fit a forward model to the June 2022, $M_w$ 6.0 Afghanistan earthquake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4)** Fit a forward model to the November 2017, $M_w$ 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake in Iran,.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these earthquakes, you will try to find a simple, single-fault model that provides a reasonable fit to the observed interferograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this practical, you should have an improved understanding of how to interpret coseismic interferograms, understand how to produce elastic dislocation models of earthquakes, and better appricate the uncertainties involved with determining earthquake mechanisms from coseismic InSAR data.\n",
