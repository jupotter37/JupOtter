    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Although release-it is a **generic** release tool, most projects use it for projects with npm packages. The recommended\n",
    "way to install release-it uses npm and adds some minimal configuration to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm init release-it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, install it manually, and add the `release` script to `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm install -D release-it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"my-package\",\n",
    "  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n",
    "  \"scripts\": {\n",
    "    \"release\": \"release-it\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"devDependencies\": {\n",
    "    \"release-it\": \"^16.1.0\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Run release-it from the root of the project using either `npm run` or `npx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm run release\n",
    "npx release-it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be prompted to select the new version, and more prompts will follow based on your configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental: knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to ask your questions in the [Release It! knowledge base][15] (powered by OpenAI and [7-docs][16]). This\n",
    "is an experimental knowledge base, answers may be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yarn\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Yarn? Please see the [npm section on Yarn][17].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monorepos\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a monorepo? Please see this [monorepo recipe][18].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Per-project installation as shown above is recommended, but global installs are supported as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From npm: `npm install -g release-it`\n",
    "- From Homebrew: `brew install release-it`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Videos, articles & examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a list of interesting external resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Video: [How to use GitHub Actions & Release-It to Easily Release Your Code][19]\n",
    "- Article: [Monorepo Semantic Releases][20] ([repo][21])\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to add yours to the list? Just open a pull request!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the box, release-it has sane defaults, and [plenty of options][22] to configure it. Most projects use a\n",
    "`.release-it.json` file in the project root, or a `release-it` property in `package.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick example `.release-it.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"git\": {\n",
    "    \"commitMessage\": \"chore: release v${version}\"\n",
    "  },\n",
    "  \"github\": {\n",
    "    \"release\": true\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Configuration][23] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive vs. CI mode\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, release-it is **interactive** and allows you to confirm each task before execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./docs/assets/release-it-interactive.gif?raw=true\" height=\"290\">\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `--ci` option, the process is fully automated without prompts. The configured tasks will be executed as\n",
    "demonstrated in the first animation above. In a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, this non-interactive mode is\n",
    "activated automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `--only-version` to use a prompt only to determine the version, and automate the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Latest version\n",
    "\n",
    "How does release-it determine the latest version?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For projects with a `package.json`, its `version` will be used (see [npm][24] to skip this).\n",
    "2. Otherwise, release-it uses the latest Git tag to determine which version should be released.\n",
    "3. As a last resort, `0.0.0` will be used as the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, a plugin can be used to override this (e.g. to manage a `VERSION` or `composer.json` file):\n",
    "\n",
    "- [@release-it/bumper][25] to read from or bump the version in any file\n",
    "- [@release-it/conventional-changelog][26] to get a recommended bump based on commit messages\n",
    "- [release-it-calver-plugin][27] to use CalVer (Calendar Versioning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the `--release-version` flag to print the **next** version without releasing anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git projects are supported well by release-it, automating the tasks to stage, commit, tag and push releases to any Git\n",
    "remote.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Git][28] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Releases\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub projects can have releases attached to Git tags, containing release notes and assets. There are two ways to add\n",
    "[GitHub releases][29] in your release-it flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automated (requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN`)\n",
    "2. Manual (using the GitHub web interface with pre-populated fields)\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [GitHub Releases][30] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitLab Releases\n",
    "\n",
    "GitLab projects can have releases attached to Git tags, containing release notes and assets. To automate [GitLab\n",
    "releases][31]:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configure `gitlab.release: true`\n",
    "- Obtain a [personal access token][32] (release-it only needs the \"api\" scope).\n",
    "- Make sure the token is [available as an environment variable][33].\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [GitLab Releases][34] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changelog\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, release-it generates a changelog, to show and help select a version for the new release. Additionally, this\n",
    "changelog serves as the release notes for the GitHub or GitLab release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [default command][22] is based on `git log ...`. This setting (`git.changelog`) can be overridden. To further\n",
    "customize the release notes for the GitHub or GitLab release, there's `github.releaseNotes` or `gitlab.releaseNotes`.\n",
    "Make sure any of these commands output the changelog to `stdout`. Note that release-it by default is agnostic to commit\n",
    "message conventions. Plugins are available for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub and GitLab Releases\n",
    "- auto-changelog\n",
    "- Conventional Changelog\n",
    "- Keep A Changelog\n",
    "\n",
    "To print the changelog without releasing anything, add the `--changelog` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Changelog][35] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publish to npm\n",
    "\n",
    "With a `package.json` in the current directory, release-it will let `npm` bump the version in `package.json` (and\n",
    "`package-lock.json` if present), and publish to the npm registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Publish to npm][24] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manage pre-releases\n",
    "\n",
    "With release-it, it's easy to create pre-releases: a version of your software that you want to make available, while\n",
    "it's not in the stable semver range yet. Often \"alpha\", \"beta\", and \"rc\" (release candidate) are used as identifiers for\n",
    "pre-releases. An example pre-release version is `2.0.0-beta.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Manage pre-releases][36] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update or re-run existing releases\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `--no-increment` to not increment the last version, but update the last existing tag/version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be helpful in cases where the version was already incremented. Here are a few example scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To update or publish a (draft) GitHub Release for an existing Git tag.\n",
    "- Publishing to npm succeeded, but pushing the Git tag to the remote failed. Then use\n",
    "  `release-it --no-increment --no-npm` to skip the `npm publish` and try pushing the same Git tag again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Use script hooks to run shell commands at any moment during the release process (such as `before:init` or\n",
    "`after:release`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The format is `[prefix]:[hook]` or `[prefix]:[plugin]:[hook]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "| part   | value                                       |\n",
    "| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| prefix | `before` or `after`                         |\n",
    "| plugin | `version`, `git`, `npm`, `github`, `gitlab` |\n",
    "| hook   | `init`, `bump`, `release`                   |\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the optional `:plugin` part in the middle to hook into a life cycle method exactly before or after any plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core plugins include `version`, `git`, `npm`, `github`, `gitlab`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that hooks like `after:git:release` will not run when either the `git push` failed, or when it is configured not to\n",
    "be executed (e.g. `git.push: false`). See [execution order][37] for more details on execution order of plugin lifecycle\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "All commands can use configuration variables (like template strings). An array of commands can also be provided, they\n",
    "will run one after another. Some example release-it configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"hooks\": {\n",
    "    \"before:init\": [\"npm run lint\", \"npm test\"],\n",
    "    \"after:my-plugin:bump\": \"./bin/my-script.sh\",\n",
    "    \"after:bump\": \"npm run build\",\n",
    "    \"after:git:release\": \"echo After git push, before github release\",\n",
    "    \"after:release\": \"echo Successfully released ${name} v${version} to ${repo.repository}.\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables can be found in the [default configuration][22]. Additionally, the following variables are exposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "version\n",
    "latestVersion\n",
    "changelog\n",
    "name\n",
    "repo.remote, repo.protocol, repo.host, repo.owner, repo.repository, repo.project\n",
    "branchName\n",
    "releaseUrl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables are available in all hooks. The only exception is that the additional variables listed above are not yet\n",
    "available in the `init` hook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `--verbose` to log the output of the commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of verbosity, the full list of hooks is actually: `init`, `beforeBump`, `bump`, `beforeRelease`, `release`\n",
    "or `afterRelease`. However, hooks like `before:beforeRelease` look weird and are usually not useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that arguments need to be quoted properly when used from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "release-it --'hooks.after:release=\"echo Successfully released ${name} v${version} to ${repo.repository}.\"'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Inquirer.js inside custom hook scripts might cause issues (since release-it also uses this itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dry Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `--dry-run` to show the interactivity and the commands it _would_ execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "→ See [Dry Runs][38] for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting & debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "- With `release-it --verbose` (or `-V`), release-it prints the output of every user-defined [hook][2].\n",
    "- With `release-it -VV`, release-it also prints the output of every internal command.\n",
    "- Use `NODE_DEBUG=release-it:* release-it [...]` to print configuration and more error details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `verbose: 2` in a configuration file to have the equivalent of `-VV` on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Since v11, release-it can be extended in many, many ways. Here are some plugins:\n",
    "\n",

    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)\n",
    "   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).\n",
    "   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.\n",
    "2. If you use the `webpack` plugin, Size Limit will bundle your JS files into\n",
    "   a single file. It is important to track dependencies and webpack polyfills.\n",
    "   It is also useful for small libraries with many small files and without\n",
    "   a bundler.\n",
    "3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library\n",
    "   and looks for the bundle size difference.\n",
    "4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of\n",
    "   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.\n",
    "5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if it’s\n",
    "   available) to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.\n",
    "   Note that these measurements depend on available resources and might\n",
    "   be unstable. [See here](https://github.com/mbalabash/estimo/issues/5)\n",
    "   for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "### JS Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitable for applications that have their own bundler and send the JS bundle\n",
    "directly to a client (without publishing it to npm). Think of a user-facing app\n",
    "or website, like an email client, a CRM, a landing page or a blog with\n",
    "interactive elements, using React/Vue/Svelte lib or vanilla JS.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary><b>Show instructions</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the preset:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    npm install --save-dev size-limit @size-limit/file\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add the `size-limit` section and the `size` script to your `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```diff\n",
    "    + \"size-limit\": [\n",
    "    +   {\n",
    "    +     \"path\": \"dist/app-*.js\"\n",

    "        \"test\": \"vitest && eslint .\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Here’s how you can get the size for your current project:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    $ npm run size\n",
    "\n",
    "      Package size: 30.08 kB with all dependencies, minified and brotlied\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now, let’s set the limit. Add 25% to the current total size and use that as\n",
    "   the limit in your `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```diff\n",
    "      \"size-limit\": [\n",

    "          \"path\": \"dist/app-*.js\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "      ],\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add the `size` script to your test suite:\n",

    "    ```diff\n",
    "      \"scripts\": {\n",
    "        \"build\": \"webpack ./webpack.config.js\",\n",
    "        \"size\": \"npm run build && size-limit\",\n",
    "    -   \"test\": \"vitest && eslint .\"\n",
    "    +   \"test\": \"vitest && eslint . && npm run size\"\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If you don’t have a continuous integration service running, don’t forget\n",

    "### JS Application and Time-based Limit\n",
    "\n",
    "File size limit (in kB) is not the best way to describe your JS application\n",
    "cost for developers. Developers will compare the size of the JS bundle\n",

    "of JS than 100 kB of an image since JS compilers are very complex.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Plugins and Presets\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins or plugin presets will be loaded automatically from `package.json`.\n",
    "For example, if you want to use `@size-limit/webpack`, you can just use\n",
    "`npm install --save-dev @size-limit/webpack`, or you can use our preset\n",
    "`@size-limit/preset-big-lib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@size-limit/file` checks the size of files with Brotli (default), Gzip\n",
    "  or without compression.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack` adds your library to empty webpack project\n",
    "  and prepares bundle file for `file` plugin.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack-why` adds reports for `webpack` plugin\n",
    "  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your\n",
    "  dependencies.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/webpack-css` adds css support for `webpack` plugin.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/esbuild` is like `webpack` plugin, but uses `esbuild`\n",
    "  to be faster and use less space in `node_modules`.\n",
    "* `@size-limit/esbuild-why` add reports for `esbuild` plugin\n",
    "  about your library is of this size to show the cost of all your\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Third-Party Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Third-party plugins and presets named starting with `size-limit-` are also supported.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`size-limit-node-esbuild`](https://github.com/un-ts/size-limit/tree/main/packages/node-esbuild)\n",
    "  is like `@size-limit/esbuild` but for Node libraries.\n",
    "* [`size-limit-preset-node-lib`](https://github.com/un-ts/size-limit/tree/main/packages/preset-node-lib)\n",

    "### Limits Config\n",
    "\n",
    "Size Limits supports three ways to define limits config.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `size-limit` section in `package.json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "     \"size-limit\": [\n",
    "       {\n",
    "         \"path\": \"index.js\",\n",
    "         \"import\": \"{ createStore }\",\n",

    "       }\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. or a separate `.size-limit.json` config file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   [\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"path\": \"index.js\",\n",
    "       \"import\": \"{ createStore }\",\n",
    "       \"limit\": \"500 ms\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. or a more flexible `.size-limit.js` or `.size-limit.cjs` config file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```js\n",
    "   module.exports = [\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       path: \"index.js\",\n",
    "       import: \"{ createStore }\",\n",
    "       limit: \"500 ms\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section in the config can have these options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **path**: relative paths to files. The only mandatory option.\n",
    "  It could be a path `\"index.js\"`, a [pattern] `\"dist/app-*.js\"`\n",
    "  or an array `[\"index.js\", \"dist/app-*.js\", \"!dist/app-exclude.js\"]`.\n",
    "* **import**: partial import to test tree-shaking. It could be `\"{ lib }\"`\n",
    "  to test `import { lib } from 'lib'`, `*` to test all exports,\n",
    "  or `{ \"a.js\": \"{ a }\", \"b.js\": \"{ b }\" }` to test multiple files.\n",
    "* **limit**: size or time limit for files from the `path` option. It should be\n",
    "  a string with a number and unit, separated by a space.\n",
    "  Format: `100 B`, `10 kB`, `500 ms`, `1 s`.\n",
    "* **name**: the name of the current section. It will only be useful\n",
    "  if you have multiple sections.\n",
    "* **entry**: when using a custom webpack config, a webpack entry could be given.\n",
    "  It could be a string or an array of strings.\n",
    "  By default, the total size of all entry points will be checked.\n",
    "* **webpack**: with `false` it will disable webpack.\n",
    "* **running**: with `false` it will disable calculating running time.\n",
    "* **gzip**: with `true` it will use Gzip compression and disable\n",
    "  Brotli compression.\n",
    "* **brotli**: with `false` it will disable any compression.\n",
    "* **config**: a path to a custom webpack config.\n",
    "* **ignore**: an array of files and dependencies to exclude from\n",
    "  the project size calculation.\n",
    "* **modifyWebpackConfig**: (.size-limit.js only) function that can be used\n",
    "  to do last-minute changes to the webpack config, like adding a plugin.\n",
    "* **compareWith**: path to `stats.json` from another build to compare\n",
    "  (when `--why` is using).\n",
    "* **uiReports**: custom UI reports list (see [Statoscope docs]).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Size Limit to track the size of CSS files, make sure to set\n",
    "`webpack: false`. Otherwise, you will get wrong numbers, because webpack\n",
    "inserts `style-loader` runtime (≈2 kB) into the bundle.\n",

    "## Analyze with `--why`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run `size-limit --why` to analyze the bundle.\n",
    "\n",

    "the report will be generated inside `<DIR>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 📄 Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pagination` functionality is now (>= `5.0.0`) implemented as a `modifier`.\n",
    "It has three different states: `error`, `idle` and `loading`. If the `state` of the `Pagination` changes the `AdvancedList` displays the view created by the view builder of the specified pagination object (`AdvancedListPagination`). Keep track of the current pagination state by creating a local state variable (`@State`) of type `AdvancedListPaginationState`. Use this state variable in the `content` `ViewBuilder` of your pagination configuration object to determine which view should be displayed in the list (see the example below).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use pagination you can choose between the `lastItemPagination` and the `thresholdItemPagination`. Both concepts are described [here](https://github.com/crelies/ListPagination). Just specify the type of the pagination when adding the `.pagination` modifier to your `AdvancedList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The view created by the `content` `ViewBuilder` of your pagination configuration object will only be visible below the List if the last item of the List appeared! That way the user is only interrupted if needed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```swift\n",
    "@State private var paginationState: AdvancedListPaginationState = .idle\n",
    "\n",
    "AdvancedList(...)\n",

    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📁 Move and 🗑️ delete items\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable the move or delete function just use the related `onMove` or `onDelete` view modifier.\n",
    "**Per default the functions are disabled if you don't add the view modifiers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```swift\n",
    "import AdvancedList\n",
