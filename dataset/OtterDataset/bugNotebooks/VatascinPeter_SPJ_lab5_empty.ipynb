    "# Lab 05: Practical performance debugging tools\n",
    "Performance is crucial in scientific computing. There is a big difference if your experiments run one minute or one hour. We have already developed quite a bit of code, both in and outside packages, on which we are going to present some of the tooling that Julia provides for finding performance bottlenecks. Performance of your code or more precisely the speed of execution is of course relative (preference, expectation, existing code) and it's hard to find the exact threshold when we should start to care about it. When starting out with Julia, we recommend not to get bogged down by the performance side of things straightaway, but just design the code in the way that feels natural to you. As opposed to other languages Julia offers you to write the things \"like you are used to\" (depending on your background), e.g. for cycles are as fast as in C; vectorization of mathematical operators works the same or even better than in MATLAB, NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have tested the functionality, you can start exploring the performance of your code by different means:\n",
    "- manual code inspection - identifying performance gotchas (tedious, requires skill)\n",
    "- automatic code inspection - `Jet.jl` (probably not as powerful as in statically typed languages)\n",
    "- benchmarking - measuring variability in execution time, comparing with some baseline (only a statistic, non-specific)\n",
    "- profiling - measuring the execution time at \"each line of code\" (no easy way to handle advanced parallelism, ...)\n",
    "- allocation tracking - similar to profiling but specifically looking at allocations (one sided statistic)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking type stability\n",
    "Recall that type stable function is written in a way, that allows Julia's compiler to infer all the types of all the variables and produce an efficient native code implementation without the need of boxing some variables in a structure whose types is known only during runtime. Probably unbeknown to you we have already seen an example of type unstable function (at least in some situations) in the first lab, where we have defined the `polynomial` function:\n"

Anyway the output basically shows what the compiler thinks of each variable in the code, albeit for us in less readable form than the original code. The more red the color is of the type info the less sure the inferred type is. Our main focus should be on the return type of the function which is just at the start of the code with the keyword `Body`. In the first case the return type is an `Int64`, whereas in the second example the compiler is unsure whether the type is `Float64` or `Int64`, marked as the `Union` type of the two.

Throughout the course we will advertise the use of the `BenchmarkTools` package, which provides an easy way to test your code multiple times. In this lab we will focus on some advanced usage tips and gotchas that you may encounter while using it. \n",

    "- trial - experiment in which multiple samples are gathered \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a benchmark is a trial in which we collect multiple samples of time/memory measurements, which in turn may be composed of multiple executions of the code in question. This layering of repetition is required to allow for benchmarking code at different runtime magnitudes. Imagine having to benchmark operations which are faster than the act of measuring itself - clock initialization, dispatch of an operation and subsequent time subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of samples/evaluations can be set manually, however most of the time won't need to know about them, due to an existence of a tuning method `tune!`, which tries to run the code once to estimate the correct ration of evaluation/samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used interface of `Benchmarkools` is the `@btime` macro, which returns an output similar to the regular `@time` macro however now aggregated over samples by taking their minimum (a robust estimator for the location parameter of the time distribution, should not be considered an outlier - usually the noise from other processes/tasks puts the results to the other tail of the distribution and some miraculous noisy speedups are uncommon. In order to see the underlying sampling better there is also the `@benchmark` macro, which runs in the same way as `@btime`, but prints more detailed statistics which are also returned in the `Trial` type instead of the actual code output.\n"

    "Profiling in Julia is part of the standard library in the `Profile` module. It implements a fairly simple sampling based profiler, which in a nutshell asks at regular intervals, where the code execution is currently at. As a result we get an array of stacktraces (= chain of function calls), which allow us to make sense of where the execution spent the most time. The number of samples, that can be stored and the period in seconds can be checked after loading `Profile` into the session with the `init()` function.\n",

For example on Windows, there is a known issue that does not allow to sample faster than at `0.003s` and even on Linux based system this may not do much. There are some further caveat specific to Julia:\n",
    "- When running profile from REPL, it is usually dominated by the interactive part which spawns the task and waits for it's completion.\n",
    "- Code has to be run before profiling in order to filter out all the type inference and interpretation stuff. (Unless compilation is what we want to profile.)\n",

When we want to run profiling on something, that takes only a few nanoseconds, we have to repeatedly execute the function.\n"
