    "## Page Faulting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section you saw how the MMU in a Pentium-like CPU\n",
    "determines whether a memory access will succeed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if the top-level entry has P=1\n",
    "   and is(read) or W=1\n",
    "   and is(supervisor) or U=1:\n",

    "### Page Faults\n",
    "\n",
    "A page fault is a special form of exception that has the following two\n",
    "characteristics: first, it is generated when an address translation\n",
    "fails, and second, it occurs in the middle of an instruction, not after\n",
    "it is done, so that the instruction can be continued after fixing the\n",
    "problem which caused the page fault. Typical information that the MMU\n",
    "passes to the page fault handler is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The instruction address when the page fault occurred. (this is the\n",
    "return address pushed on the stack as part of the exception handling\n",
    "process)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The address that caused the page fault\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Whether the access attempt was a read or a write\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Whether the access was attempted in user or supervisor mode\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the page fault handler returns, the instruction that caused the\n",
    "fault resumes, and it retries the memory access that caused the fault in\n",
    "the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "15 Many of the examples in this section are illustrated using Linux, as\n",
    "the source code is readily available, but same principles (although not\n",
    "details) hold true for other modern OSes such as Windows, Mac OS X, or\n",
    "Solaris.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, keep in mind that the virtual memory map for a process is a\n",
    "software concept, and will almost certainly differ between two unrelated\n",
    "operating systems. In contrast, the page table structure is defined by\n",
    "the CPU itself, and must be used in that form by any operating system\n",
    "running on that CPU.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A single instruction can cause multiple, different page faults, of which\n",
    "there are two different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instruction fetch:** A fault can occur when the CPU tries to fetch the\n",
    "instruction at a particular address. If the instruction \\\"straddles\\\" a\n",
    "page boundary (i.e., a 6-byte instruction that starts 2 bytes before the\n",
    "end of a page) then you could (in the worst case) get two page faults\n",
    "while trying to fetch an instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory access:** Once the instruction has been fetched and decoded, it\n",
    "may require one or more memory accesses that result in page faults.\n",
    "These memory accesses include those to the stack (e.g., for CALL and RET\n",
    "instructions) in addition to load and store instructions. As before,\n",
    "accessing memory that straddles a page boundary will result in\n",

    "read-only pages---these are intrinsically safe to share, because\n",
    "processes are unable to modify the pages and thereby affect other\n",
    "processes. But, can writable pages be shared safely? The answer is yes,\n",
    "but it has to be done carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some background on why this is important. The Unix operating\n",
    "system uses two system calls to create new processes and execute\n",

    "UNIX uses this method because of an arbitrary choice someone made 40\n",
    "years ago; there are many other ways to do it, each of them with their\n",
    "own problems. However this is how UNIX works, and we're stuck with it,\n",
    "so it's important to be able to do it quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early versions of Unix, `fork()` was implemented by literally copying\n",
    "all the writable sections (e.g., stack, data) of the parent process\n",
    "address space into the child process address space. After doing all this\n",
    "work, most (but not all) of the time, the first thing the child process\n",
    "would do is to call exec(), throwing away the entire contents of the\n",
    "address space that were just copied. It's bad enough when the shell does\n",
    "this, but even worse when a large program (e.g. Chrome) tries to execute\n",
    "a small program (e.g. /bin/ls) in a child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen how to share read-only data, but can we do anything\n",
    "about writable data? In particular, data which is writable, but isn't\n",
    "actually going to be written?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick inspection of several Firefox and Safari instances (using pmap\n",
    "on Linux and vmmap on OS X) indicates that a browser with two or three\n",
    "open tabs can easily have over 300MB of writable address space[^17].\n",
    "When fork is executed these writable pages can't just be given writable\n",
    "mappings in the child process, or changes made in one process would be\n",
    "visible in the other. In certain cases (i.e., the stack) this mutual\n",
    "over-writing of memory would almost certainly be disastrous.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in practice, most of these writable pages *won't* be written to\n",
