    "\n",
    "**Act of hostility**: When a player invades another, or supports an invasion to the other player's territory.\n",

    "- Each **year** is broken down into two **seasons**: {'Spring', 'Fall'}.\n",
    "- Each **season** is itself divided into several phases, called **turns** (therefore, a year is made of at least two turns, and not more than five):\n",
    "    - **orders**: each player submit orders to all of his/her units (that can be **hold**, **move**, **support** or **convoy**)\n",
    "    - **retreats**: a phase that happens when some units (called **disloged units**) need to retreat. If they can't, they are destroyed\n",
    "    - **builds**: only happens after the *fall retreat*. Players gain control of **supply centers**  they are occupying.\n",
    "- Geographically, the game is divided into **provinces**.\n",
    "- Some provinces are called **supply centers** (SCS) and to win, a **player** must control 18 supply centers.\n",
    "- Each **unit** belongs to a **player** and there can be **only one unit** in a province at a time, however **units** can join their force with the **support** order.\n",
    "- There are two types of **units**:  {'F' or 'A'} for {Fleet, Army}.\n",
    "- Each **player** is characterized by his/her country, encoded by a letter: {E,F,I,G,A,T,R} standing for {England, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Turkey, Russia}.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also give a clarification for the rows of 'all_orders' (i.e. the proper orders) because we will be using those quite a lot, and it can be hard to understand. \n",
    "- Orders are defined by a **game_id**, a **unit_id** and a **turn_number** (which makes sense, considering all the above points). \n",

    "- AoH = \"Act of hostility\"\n",

Let's define 2 criteria: one internal criterion and one external criterion that 'bags of AoF' must verify in order to be part of an actual friendship.\n",

    "a. **Internal criteria** that a bag of AOFs must verify (*internal* because it only depends on the AoFs)\n",
    "- more than 2 acts emitted by the 2 countries\n",
    "- the overall time elapsed is longer than 1.5 years\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **External criterion** that a bag of AoFs must verify (*external* because the criterion depends on the AoHs that happened at the same time)\n",
    "- no AoH in the same time range\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each pair of countries** (*their friendship is represented by a column of the 'friendships' dataframe*): \n",
    "1. Find all AoFs that happened between them. Consider them like a bag of AoFs. \n",
    "2. Verify that this 'bag of acts of friendships' (BAOF) verifies the *internal criteria* mentioned above. If so, fill all cells between the first season and the last season with '1's. Else, make sure '0's are placed at the seasons of interest. \n",
    "3. Find acts of hostility that happened between the same time range as the bag of words. Split the bag of words (*actually, it's the seasons array that is split*) for every act of hostility so that we obtain \n",
    "4. For each bag of AoF (hence, uninterrupted by hostility, so external validity is verified !) verify internal validity again. If not verified, replace '1's with zeros.\n",
    "5. Find betrayal, as the event:  \"breaking a bags of AoFs with more than 1 hostile action\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's note that since step 3 doesn't need to be repeated, it is not a recursive algorithm. Recursive approaches were also tried, but they turned out to be a lot harder than this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing this algorithm, we need a 'splitting' function that is also a little tricky to find. There are several ways to do this splitting properly (recursive splitting would be one way) but we will use a vectorized approach. **We want to split a list of 'ones' divided by zeros into a list of 'bags' of ones**. Let's just show how one can do that here using the power of **numpy**. "

    "What do we observe ? The predictor has an overall accuracy of 85%: **this is better than random guess, however it is less than a most-frequent choice** . Because of the **strong class imbalance**, the accuracy isn't enough to determine, but we can look at the confusion matrix $C$ and see where does our classifier do the mistakes. \n",
    "- The second column of $C$ reveals that the accuracy of detecting betrayer is really low. Only one betrayal is detected on the test set, which is really not good at all. \n",
    "- The first row shows that $148 / 154 \\approx 0.96 \\%$ of non betrayal seasons are classifed as so. \n",
    "- We notice that 6 seasons that are non betrayal are detected as betrayals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that given more time, we could have found better results. At least, we really could have tried a lot more. Indeed, the data-processing to find betrayals was extremely time consuming and since we also had to invest time writing the data story and the report, we really didn't have many days working on the classifier. Here is a list of 'future plans' that we would have liked to do:\n",
    "- Ask ourself the question, like what the authors of the paper did,: **is it the case because some betrayals are detected too early ?** (*Actually, looking at the data we realize that it is probably not the case...*)\n",
    "- After looking at the prediction results, we noticed that, for a few games, many betrayals are detected, so we must answer to the question: **how can we enforce that there's only one betrayal per game ?** Adding this constraint is likely to increase the learning of the classifier. \n",
    "- Design better features\n",
    "- Perform cross-validation for feature selection\n",
    "- Have a more complex classifier. After all, humans are not able to perform well at this task, so it would not be suprising that even after doing all the previous steps and investing a lot of time on them, we realize that a linear classifier isn't able to do that. "
