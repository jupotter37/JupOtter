        "Potential Oral Examination Questions and Answers\n",
        "Q: What is the purpose of data encryption?\n",
        "A: Data encryption secures sensitive information by converting it into an unreadable format. Only users with the correct decryption key can access the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How does Fernet encryption work?\n",
        "A: Fernet encryption uses symmetric encryption, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It ensures data is both confidential and authenticated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why do we use a hash function to verify data integrity?\n",
        "A: A hash function generates a fixed-size hash from the data, which uniquely represents it. If the data changes, the hash will also change, allowing us to detect any modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Explain the difference between encryption and hashing.\n",
        "A: Encryption is reversible, allowing data to be decrypted back to its original form with a key. Hashing is one-way; it’s used for data integrity checks and cannot be reversed to get the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What is the purpose of the damping_factor in encryption?\n",
        "A: This question might be a confusion point since the damping factor doesn’t relate to encryption. Damping factors are used in algorithms like PageRank for balancing probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Can you explain the role of SHA-256 in this code?\n",
        "A: SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that outputs a unique 256-bit hash for any input data. In this code, it verifies data integrity by comparing hashes of the original and decrypted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Why is it necessary to encode data before encryption and decryption?\n",
        "A: Encoding converts the data to bytes, which is required by Fernet for both encryption and decryption processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How would you handle data integrity verification if there were multiple pieces of data?\n",
        "A: I would concatenate all data pieces into a single string or calculate individual hashes for each data piece and verify each separately.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What are some common use cases for hashing?\n",
        "A: Hashing is commonly used for password storage, data integrity checks, digital signatures, and file verification.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: How can you confirm that encrypted data has not been altered?\n",
        "A: Since Fernet includes authentication with encryption, it would raise an error during decryption if the data were altered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: Could a different encryption method be used here? If so, why or why not?\n",
        "A: Yes, other symmetric encryption methods like AES could be used. Fernet, however, is secure and easier to implement, which is why it’s suitable for this example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q: What happens if the decryption key doesn’t match the encryption key?\n",
        "A: If the keys don’t match, decryption will fail, resulting in an error since only the correct key can decrypt data encrypted with a specific Fernet key.\n",

        "Key Differences Between Arduino and Raspberry Pi\n",
        "\n",
        "Processor: Arduino uses a microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328), which is designed for simple tasks with low processing power,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi uses a more powerful ARM-based processor (e.g., Cortex-A72), capable of handling complex operations and multitasking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory: Arduino boards have limited memory, typically ranging from 2KB to 256KB, as they are optimized for small,\n",
        "specific tasks, whereas Raspberry Pi comes with 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB of RAM, supporting more demanding applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Operating System: Arduino does not run an operating system and executes code directly on its microcontroller,\n",
        "whereas Raspberry Pi runs a full-fledged operating system (such as Raspberry Pi OS), allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks like a regular computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming Language: Arduino is primarily programmed in C/C++ using the Arduino IDE,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi supports multiple programming languages including Python, C, C++, and others, giving it more flexibility for complex projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connectivity: Arduino has limited connectivity options, mainly for serial communication, SPI, and I2C,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi offers robust connectivity, including Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth, enabling it to connect to networks and the internet easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "GPIO Pins: Arduino typically has 14 digital I/O pins and 6 analog input pins, which are suitable for simple interfacing with sensors and actuators,\n",
        "whereas Raspberry Pi has 40 digital GPIO pins with support for SPI, I2C, and UART, offering more flexibility for complex I/O tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Processing Power: Arduino has relatively low processing power with an 8-bit microcontroller running at a clock speed of up to 16MHz,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi is much more powerful, with a quad-core ARM processor running up to 1.5GHz, capable of handling more intensive tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Storage: Arduino stores its program in flash memory, which is limited in size,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi uses a microSD card for storage, allowing for much larger files and an operating system to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases: Arduino is ideal for simpler embedded systems and projects that require real-time processing and hardware control, such as sensors, robotics, and automation,\n",
        "while Raspberry Pi is better suited for more advanced projects such as web servers, media centers, IoT applications, and running applications that require a full OS.\n",
        "\n",
        "Power Supply: Arduino typically operates on an external adapter or USB, requiring less power,\n",
        "whereas Raspberry Pi needs a 5V USB-C power supply and can be powered by a more substantial external adapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conclusion\n",
        "Arduino is ideal for simple embedded systems, sensors, actuators, and projects requiring direct hardware control.\n",
        "Raspberry Pi is suited for more advanced projects like web servers, media centers, robotics, and anything that requires running a full operating system or handling more complex computations.\n",
