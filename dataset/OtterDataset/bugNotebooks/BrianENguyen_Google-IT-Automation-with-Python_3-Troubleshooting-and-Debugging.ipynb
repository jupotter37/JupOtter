    "## 1. What to Do When You Can't Be Physically There\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to troubleshooting problems on physical computers. It can take a bit of a mindset shift to get used to fixing problems with virtual machines running in the cloud. There's a bunch of things that you can't do, you can't walk up to a server and check out what's wrong with it. But there's also other things that are a lot simpler when troubleshooting VMs in the cloud. Like adding more memory or moving the machine to a different data center. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that after the latest upgrade, a bunch of your cloud VMs have stopped booting. Something went wrong, but you don't know exactly what. You can't connect to the instances or boot them in rescue mode, so what can you do? There's a bunch of options, if you're following the infrastructure as code practices that we've talked about. You could deploy new VMs with the previous version of the system, this would help us get back to a healthy state as quickly as possible. On top of this, you want to understand the problem and how to fix it. To do that, you can create a snapshot of the disk image for one of the failing VMs. And then mount that disk image on a healthy machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img46](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-4-Managing-Cloud-Instances-at-Scale/img/img46.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you can analyze the contents of the image and figure out what's causing the failures. And it's not always easy to know which piece of the system is causing a failure. Especially if the system is complex with many different services interacting with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to figure out what's causing your complex servers to respond with a ton of 500s. You need to look at different pieces individually until you find the culprit. Does the problem happen if you run the service and a test VM? Without any load balancers or caching servers in between? Does it happen if you run the service locally on your workstation? The more you can isolate the faulty behavior, the easier it is to fix it. You should remember that problems will happen, it makes sense to spend some time getting ready for them. Setting up a testing environment might take time and effort. So it's a good idea to do this in advance before any problem actually happens. That way you don't need to do it under pressure when your users are complaining that the system's down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you're using a database service that's only reachable from inside your cloud network. This means you can't interact with it directly from the outside, only from instances within your cloud infrastructure. If your service starts acting up, you might want to check the responses from the database directly. Rather than going through any of the other back-end servers. To do this, you'll need to have a debugging machine in the network and you'll need to use tools to interact with the database directly. \n",

    "\n",
    "Again, setting the machine up, and learning how to use the tools takes time. So get ahead of the game and do it in advance before any problems come up. You might remember from the troubleshooting and debugging course, that understanding logs is super important for being able to solve problems in IT."

    "## 2. Identifying Where the Failure Is Coming From\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've called out a few times, when we host our services in the cloud, we need to give up part of the control over the infrastructure that we're using. This might be especially noticeable when we're trying to find the root cause of a problem in our service and we don't know if the failure is caused by an error on our side or on the provider side. So what can we do in that case? \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Geographical Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems on the provider side tend to be isolated to geographical regions. If you're seeing weird problems and you have no idea what could be going on, you can try bringing up your service in a different region and checking if the failure happens there too. If it works fine there, it's likely that there's an issue with the cloud infrastructure and you should bring it up with your provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Machine Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "If it fails in the other regions too, it's likely that it's a problem with your system. Similarly, if you're seeing problems related to resource usage, you can try running the same system in a different machine type and checking how it behaves there. This could help out, for example, if your service takes too much time to process incoming requests. By changing your service to more powerful machines, you might improve the overall performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Rollbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option that we've mentioned a bunch is doing rollbacks for the pieces that have recently changed. Having all your infrastructure stored as code in a version control system will let you access the history of the changes to each component in the system. When setting up your service, you should make sure that you can deploy and roll back each individual piece. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you get an alert saying that the web servers in your application are using a lot more memory than they used to you. You don't know why but you know that a new version was deployed a couple of days ago. By rolling back to the previous version, you can verify if that change was at fault or not. If the server's work fine after the rollback, you can investigate the specific changes and try to figure out why they're using so much more memory. If the server's are still using a lot of memory after the rollback, it means something else is up. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img48](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-4-Managing-Cloud-Instances-at-Scale/img/img48.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "In an earlier video, we touched briefly upon one popular option when running things on the cloud called containers. Containers are packaged applications that are shipped together with their libraries and dependencies. Each application is executed in a separate container, completely independent of any other applications running on the same machine. Now, one of the neat characteristics of containerized applications is that you can deploy the same container to your local workstation to a server running on-premise or to cloud infrastructure provided by different vendors. This can be really helpful when trying to understand if the failure is in the code or the infrastructure. You simply deploy the container somewhere else and check if it behaves the same way. When using containers, the typical architecture is to have a lot of small containers that take care of different parts of the service. This means that the overall system can get really complex and when something breaks, it can be hard to identify where the problem is coming from. The key to solving problems in the container world is to make sure you have good logs coming in from all of the parts of the system. And, that you can bring up test instances of each of the applications to try things out when necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Up next, we'll talk about some of the tools that we can use in the cloud to recover from outages."

    "## 3. Recovering from Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with a complex system, there's a lot of ways it can fail. If we want our service to be reliable, we need to make sure that we can get it up and running as quickly as possible when bad things happen. We'll need to have good backups and a well-documented recovery plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Backups\n",
    "\n",
    "Backups here doesn't mean just copies of your data. It also means backups for the different pieces of your infrastructure, including the instances that are running the service and the network that's used to connect to the service. Backups of the data your service handles are extremely important. **If you operate a service that stores any kind of data, it's critical that you implement automatic backups and that you periodically check that those backups are working correctly by performing restores.** This helps make sure that you're backing up the right data and that you have well-documented processes for recovering it when things fail. What about the rest of the infrastructure? If you store all your Infrastructure as code, you already have a backup of what your infrastructure should look like. But if your service goes down for some reason, deploying all that infrastructure from scratch might take awhile. That's why many teams keep backup or a secondary instances of their services already up and running. That way, if there's a problem with the primary instance, they can simply point the load balancer or the DNS entries to the secondary instance with minimal disruption to the service. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Having Many Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it's common practice to have enough servers running at any time so that if one of them goes down, the others can still handle the traffic, or on a larger scale, have the service running on different data centers around the world, so that if one of the data centers has a problem, the service can still be provided by the instances running in the other data centers. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running a service on-premise, you might want to have two different connections to the Internet. This way, if the connection offered by one of your ISPs goes down, you can still connect to the Internet through the other one. When you're running on Cloud, you can mostly rely on your Cloud provider having enough network redundancy. But if you really care about your service staying up no matter what, you might want to run your service on two different Cloud vendors so that if one of the providers has a large outage, you can still rely on the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you're running your service in one data center. Unfortunately, that data center has just suffered a natural disaster, and all of your instances are down. What do you do? First step, deep breath, don't panic. You need to recover your service from scratch, deploying it in a different data center and getting all your data from backups. As long as the backups are available in other data centers and your Infrastructure is fully stored in a version control system, this should be possible. But figuring out how to successfully bring up the whole system from scratch can take awhile. So you don't want to have to scramble to do it when disaster hits. Instead, you should have a documented procedure that explains all of the steps that you need to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Having Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since systems evolve over time, you need to make sure that this documentation stays up-to-date. One way to do that is to once in a while pretend that you need to recover your service, follow the documented steps, and check if anything is missing or outdated. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img49](https://github.com/Brian-E-Nguyen/Google-IT-Automation-with-Python/blob/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/5-Config-Management-and-Cloud/Week-4-Managing-Cloud-Instances-at-Scale/img/img49.jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems will fail. A hundred percent availability is simply not an achievable targets, but being prepared for a failure will let you recover your service quickly and keep your users happy. Up next, we've gathered some resources to give you more info on how to debug problems on the Cloud and to be ready for when things fail. After that, the last quiz of the course awaits you."
