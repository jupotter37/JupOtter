    "Python 3.5 added an intersting new library called **typing**. This adds type hinting to Python. Type hinting is kind of declaring your functions arguments to have a certain type. However the type hinting is not binding. It's just a hint, so there's nothing preventing the programmer from passing something they shouldn't. This is Python after all. You can read the type hinting specification in PEP 484 or you can just read the theory behind it in PEP 483.\n",
