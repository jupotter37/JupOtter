    "Functions are one of the most important concepts in computer programming, and perhaps the most underrated by students. As our codes get larger and more complex, using functions becomes a necessity, as they can be used to break down a large task into a collection of smaller tasks. In programming, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Functions are ideal because they can be reused multiple times with different input data.\n",

    "* Trace function calls to understand program flow and variable scope\n",
    "* Write functions with default input arguments\n",

A list of important built-in functions can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Since these are built-in, they are always available, without having to import any modules. We have also used functions from modules, such as `math.log()` and `math.tan()`.\n",

    "In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. A function can have **input arguments**, which are made available to it by the user. Functions can also have **output parameters**, which are the results of the function that the user expects to receive once the function has completed its task. For example, the function `math.sin()` has one input argument, an angle in radians, and one output parameter, an approximation to the sine function of the input angle. The sequence of instructions to compute the sine of the angle is the **body** of the function, which until this point has not been shown.\n",

If Python didn't provide some mechanism to separate variables within a function and those outside, every time we call `sum_3()`, the external variable `out` would be overwritten by the internal value within the function.

In this case, the order of the arguments is important because Python assumes that they follow the same order as in the function definition.\n",

When you call a function, you can precede some or all of the arguments by their name and an equal sign, such as `sum_3(c=1, a=5, b=6)`. This allows you to tell the function exactly which argument you are passing. In this case, the order of the arguments is no longer relevant and can differ from that in the function definition.\n",
