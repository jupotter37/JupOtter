    "*Some important notes on indentation*  Indentation in python is typically *4 spaces*. Most programming text editors will be smart about indentation, and will also convert TABs to four spaces. Jupyter notebooks are smart about indentation, and will do the right thing, i.e., autoindent a line below a line with a trailing colon, and convert TABs to spaces. \n"
