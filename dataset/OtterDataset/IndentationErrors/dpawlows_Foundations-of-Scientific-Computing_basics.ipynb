We used a function that had a dot in front of it, and then I called it a \"method\". This syntax is the first time that we've really been exposed to the object orientedness of python. Python is an object oriented programming language. That means that we can create things called objects, which means they have special powers. In fact, python is famous because it takes its object orientedness very seriously in that everything in python is considered an \n",
    "object. Once again, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail here. I mention this now because I want you to get familiar with the jargon of object oriented programming so that it is less confusing when looking at documentation or code examples.\n",

    "In short, object oriented programming (OOP) places emphasis on the associations between the data and the operations that are done on them. An example: suppose you are analyzing a population of students and tracking how well they performed on a certain exam based on which curriculum they took. Every student would have a set of parameters that are basically the same, GPA, academic year, age, major but could take on certain values that of course would be different. The object oriented approach to this example would be to define an object, maybe called student, and associate those parameters with the student object. So you could imagine creating a specific student object called \"Ben\" and specifying his major as \"physics\". This would look something like (note that this wont work in python because we would have to do a few more things, namely specify what a Student is. But this is the gist):"
