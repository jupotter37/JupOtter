These exceptional situations, also known as exceptions, can include errors, invalid input, file not found, network issues, and other unexpected events. By handling exceptions, programmers can gracefully manage these situations and prevent the program from crashing. In Python, exceptions are objects that represent errors. When an error occurs during the execution of a program, Python raises an exception. Exceptions can be raised explicitly by the programmer or implicitly by the Python interpreter when it encounters an error."
