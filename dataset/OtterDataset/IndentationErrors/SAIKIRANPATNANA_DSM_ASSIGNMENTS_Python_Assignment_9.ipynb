    "Q1. When creating a custom exception in Python, it is essential to inherit from the `Exception` class or any of its subclasses. This is because the `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. By inheriting from the `Exception` class, our custom exception can benefit from the functionality and features provided by the base class, such as the ability to capture and display error messages, stack traces, and other useful information.\n",

    "ArithmeticError is the base class for arithmetic errors. Two errors defined in this class are:\n",
    "- OverflowError: Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the limit for a specific numeric type.\n",
    "- ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# OverflowError example\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = sys.maxsize + 1\n",

    "Q4. LookupError class is used for key-related lookup errors. Two common examples of LookupError are KeyError and IndexError:\n",
    "- KeyError: Raised when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "- IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    value = my_dict['c']\n",

    "Q5. ImportError is raised when an import statement fails to find the module, or when an imported module cannot be initialized correctly. ModuleNotFoundError is a subclass of ImportError and is specifically raised when a module is not found during import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Best practices for exception handling in Python include:\n",
    "- Use specific exception types to catch only the expected errors.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages.\n",
    "- Avoid catching generic exceptions like `Exception` unless necessary.\n",
    "- Use `finally` block for cleanup actions that must be executed whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "- Minimize the scope of the `try` block to only include the statements that might raise exceptions.\n",
    "- Log exceptions using a logging framework to keep track of errors and debug easily.\n",
    "- Prefer raising exceptions over returning error codes to propagate errors up the call stack.\n",
    "- Use context managers (e.g., `with` statement) to ensure resources are properly released.\n",
    "- Follow the principle of EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) over LBYL (Look Before You Leap)."
