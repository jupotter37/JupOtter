    "# MinHeap as Priority Queue Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The MinHeap class represents a priority queue using a binary heap structure. Priority queues prioritize elements based on a defined order, ensuring that elements with higher priority (lower numeric value in this case) are dequeued first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert Method**: Adds a new item to the heap.\n",
    "  - Inserts the item as the last leaf node.\n",
    "  - Uses `heapify_up` to maintain the heap property by swapping the item with its parent until it satisfies the heap condition (`parent <= child`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove Method**: Removes and returns the smallest item (root) from the heap.\n",
    "  - Replaces the root with the last item in the heap.\n",
    "  - Uses `heapify_down` to restore the heap property by swapping the root with its smallest child until the heap condition is met (`parent <= children`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion**: O(log n) - Due to the `heapify_up` operation.\n",
    "- **Removal**: O(log n) - Due to the `heapify_down` operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "- The heap ensures that elements with lower numeric values (higher priority) are positioned closer to the root.\n",
    "- This ensures that when removing elements, those with higher priority are dequeued first, akin to how a priority-based queue functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Equal Priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elements with equal priority are handled based on their insertion order.\n",
    "- Maintains FIFO (First In, First Out) for elements with the same priority to respect order of insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: A hospital's emergency room where patients are prioritized based on their medical risk levels (lower number = higher risk).\n",
    "- **Behavior**: Patients with higher medical risk are dequeued first, ensuring critical cases receive immediate attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The MinHeap class provides an efficient way to manage a priority queue, ensuring elements are handled in order of their priority while respecting FIFO for equal priorities."
