    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* is back. They want you to improve upon the App you wrote previously that estimates the amount of paint required to paint a room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the program from the previous assignment will be the same but with the following two improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement 1** House depot sells 3 different qualities of paint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 Gallon of **Everyday** paint costs 19.95 and covers 320 square feet  \n",
    "- 1 Gallon of **Premium** paint costs 29.95 and covers 400 square feet  \n",
    "- 1 Gallon of **Professional** paint costs 34.95 as covers 425 square feet  \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Improvement 2** You will write a user-friendly version of the program using IPywidgets and the `@interact_manual` decorator.\n",
    "- **length** of the room is a slider from 1 to 40 feet\n",
    "- **width** of the room is a slider from 1 to 40 feet\n",
    "- **height** of walls is a slider from 6 to 10 feet in 0.5 ft increments\n",
    "- **coats** is the number of coats of paint on the walls a sliders from 1 to 3\n",
    "- **paint** is a drop-down of the 3 qualities of paint `['Everyday','Premium','Professional']`\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately your program allows the user to input the dimensions of a room, number of coats, and select a paint quality. The program then outputs the square footage to be painted, gallons of paint (in whole gallons), and total cost of the paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write this program in several phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You Code 2.1** write a function return the cost and coverage based on the type of paint input, `get_paint_info`\n",
    "- **You Code 2.2** rewrite the House Depot assignment as a function, `calculate_paint_area`\n",
    "- **You Code 2.3** write the final program to solve the problem, using your functions and regular `input` and `print` statements.\n",
    "- **You Code 2.4** re-write the final program to use `@interact_manual` and the IPywidgets in place of `input` and `print` statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a \"bottom up\" approach. Write each function first, test the function, then once you know it's right use the functions in your main program.\n",
    "- The code exercise from small group demonstrates how to create drop-downs and sliders with ipython widgets\n",
    "- If you use several code cells (which you probably will) make sure a copy  of all relevant code is in the code solution cell.\n",
    "- The lab has functions you can re-use to print  out the big title. and display text. "
