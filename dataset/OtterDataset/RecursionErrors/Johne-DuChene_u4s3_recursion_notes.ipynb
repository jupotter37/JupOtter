    "Most programming problems are solvable without recursion. So, strictly speaking, recursion usually isn’t necessary.  \n",

    "Traversal of tree-like data structures is another good example. Because these are nested structures, they readily fit a recursive definition. A non-recursive algorithm to walk through a nested structure is likely to be somewhat clunky, while a recursive solution will be relatively elegant. An example of this appears later in this tutorial.  \n",
    "On the other hand, recursion isn’t for every situation. Here are some other factors to consider:  \n",
    "- For some problems, a recursive solution, though possible, will be awkward rather than elegant.  \n",
    "- Recursive implementations often consume more memory than non-recursive ones.  \n",
    "- In some cases, using recursion may result in slower execution time.  \n",
