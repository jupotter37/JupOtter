    "We have seen that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for a function to call **itself**, which is known as **recursion**. If you ever stood between two mirrors, you could see yourself in mirror after mirror, deeper and deeper, to infinity. This is infinite recursion &ndash; the reflection of one mirror includes the reflection of the second mirror, which includes the reflection of the first, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, recursion is when a function calls a copy of itself, and the copy may call yet another copy, and so on. These recursions are finite, as the process repeats itself until a condition is satisfied (otherwise, the program might run indefinitely).\n",

    "A recursive function is a function that repeatedly calls itself until a specified condition is met. This approach solves problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable instances of the same problem. A recursive function has two essential components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Base Case**: The condition under which the function stops calling itself and returns a result.\n",
    "* **Recursive Case**: The part of the function that reduces the problem into smaller instances and calls the function on these smaller instances. This is also known as the general or non-base case.\n",
