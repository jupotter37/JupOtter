    "\n",
    "The `try` and `except` blocks are used in Python to handle exceptions. <br /> The code within the `try` block is executed, and if an exception is raised, the code within the `except` block is executed instead of the code following the `try` block. This allows for graceful handling of errors and prevents the program from crashing."

    "### 4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific exception type?\n",
    "\n",
    "When handling exceptions in Python, we can either specify a specific exception type to catch, or use a bare `except` block to catch all exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a specific exception type allows you to handle different exceptions in different ways. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except TypeError:\n",
    "    # handle TypeError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `try` block contains some code that might raise an exception. The `except` blocks catch specific exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, using a bare `except` block catches all exceptions, regardless of their type. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # some code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    # handle any exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `except` block catches any exception that was raised in the `try` block, regardless of its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's generally recommended to avoid using a bare `except` block, as it can catch unexpected exceptions and make it harder to debug errors. It's better to catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately."
