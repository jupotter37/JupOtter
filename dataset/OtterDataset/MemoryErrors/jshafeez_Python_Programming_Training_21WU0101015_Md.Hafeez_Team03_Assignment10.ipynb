    "### Ques-1. Role of `try` and `except` Block:\n",
    "The `try` and `except` blocks in Python are used to handle exceptions (errors). The `try` block allows you to test a block of code for errors, while the `except` block lets you handle those errors gracefully without stopping the program. It provides a way to catch and handle exceptions (errors) without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-2. Syntax for a Basic `try-except` Block:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except SomeException as e:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-3. What Happens if an Exception Occurs Inside a `try` Block and There is No Matching `except` Block?\n",
    "If an exception occurs in a `try` block and there is no matching `except` block, the program will terminate and an error message (traceback) will be displayed, indicating the exception that was not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-4. Difference Between Using a Bare `except` Block and Specifying a Specific Exception Type:\n",
    "- **Bare `except` block**: It catches all exceptions, including unexpected ones (like keyboard interrupts). This can be dangerous because it might catch errors that should have been handled differently.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    except:\n",
    "       \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specific exception type**: It only catches the specified type of exception, making the code more predictable and safer.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-5. Can You Have Nested `try-except` Blocks in Python? Example:\n",
    "Yes, you can have nested `try-except` blocks. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = 10 / x\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "    except Exception as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Some error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-6. Can We Use Multiple `except` Blocks? Example:\n",
    "Yes, you can use multiple `except` blocks to handle different exceptions. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    result = 10 / num\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-7. Reasons for the Following Errors:\n",
    "- **EOFError**: This occurs when the `input()` function hits an end of file (EOF) condition (usually when no input is provided, like in automated scripts).\n",
    "- **FloatingPointError**: Raised when a floating point operation fails (e.g., division by zero in some implementations).\n",
    "- **IndexError**: Occurs when trying to access an index that is out of range in a list, tuple, or string.\n",
    "- **MemoryError**: Raised when an operation runs out of memory (e.g., allocating too much memory).\n",
    "- **OverflowError**: Happens when a numerical calculation exceeds the largest number that can be handled by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- **TabError**: Raised when there’s an inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation.\n",
    "- **ValueError**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type, but an inappropriate value (e.g., trying to convert a string that doesn’t represent a number to an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question-8. Code with `try-except` Blocks for Given Scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Program to divide two numbers:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n",
    "    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n",
    "    result = num1 / num2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",

    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
