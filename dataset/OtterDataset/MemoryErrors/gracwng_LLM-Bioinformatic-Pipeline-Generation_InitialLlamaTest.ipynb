      "Metadata Description: This Common Workflow Language (CWL) tool implements the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) function \"ApplyBQSR,\" which is used for base quality score recalibration in genomic data processing. It takes as input a BAM file, a base recalibration file, and various optional parameters, and produces a recalibrated BAM file along with optional index and VCF outputs. Notable features include support for multiple command-line options for fine-tuning the recalibration process, such as output indexing, read filtering, and quality score preservation.\n",
