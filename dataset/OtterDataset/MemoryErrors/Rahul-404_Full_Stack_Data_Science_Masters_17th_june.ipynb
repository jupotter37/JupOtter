    "In Python, the `try` and `except` blocks are used for handling exceptions, which are runtime errors that can occur during the execution of a program. The main roles of `try` and `except` blocks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Role of `try` and `except` Blocks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - **`try` Block**: The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception. It is where you put code that you want to test for potential errors.\n",
    "   - **`except` Block**: The `except` block is used to catch and handle exceptions that are raised in the `try` block. You can specify the type of exception to catch or use a general `except` block to catch any exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prevent Program Crashes**:\n",
    "   - By using `try` and `except`, you can handle exceptions gracefully instead of letting the program crash. This ensures that the program can continue running or exit cleanly even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Providing Error Messages**:\n",
    "   - You can provide informative error messages or perform specific actions when an exception occurs, which can help with debugging or user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleaning Up Resources**:\n",
    "   - In conjunction with the `finally` block, you can ensure that certain cleanup actions are always performed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a basic example demonstrating the use of `try` and `except` blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    # Code that will always be executed, regardless of an exception\n",
    "    print(\"Execution complete.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **`try` Block**: Attempts to execute `10 / 0`, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "- **`except` Block**: Catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.\n",
    "- **`finally` Block**: Executes the cleanup code regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**:\n",
    "- **Specific Exceptions**: You can catch specific exceptions by naming them, e.g., `except ValueError:`.\n",
    "- **General Exception**: Using `except Exception:` catches any exception, but it’s often better to handle specific exceptions to avoid masking bugs.\n",
    "- **`finally` Block**: (Optional) Executes code that should run regardless of whether an exception was raised, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you need further clarification or have additional questions about exception handling in Python!"

  },

   "source": [
    "The syntax for a basic `try`-`except` block in Python is designed to handle exceptions that may arise during the execution of code. Here’s the structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    # Example: risky operation\n",
    "    risky_code()\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    # Example: handling the error\n",
    "    handle_error()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**:\n",
    "   - This block contains the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, Python will stop executing the remaining code in the `try` block and jump to the `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Block**:\n",
    "   - This block contains code that runs if an exception specified in `ExceptionType` occurs in the `try` block. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       print(10 / 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation**: If a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised in the `try` block, the `except` block will catch it and print the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Multiple Exceptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       value = int(\"string\")  # This will raise a ValueError\n",
    "   except ValueError:\n",
    "       print(\"ValueError: Cannot convert string to integer.\")\n",
    "   except TypeError:\n",
    "       print(\"TypeError: A type error occurred.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation**: If a `ValueError` is raised, the first `except` block handles it. If a `TypeError` were raised, it would be handled by the second `except` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling All Exceptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / int(\"string\")  # This will raise a ValueError\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation**: This example catches all exceptions and prints a general error message. `Exception` is the base class for all built-in exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `else` and `finally`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       result = 10 / 2  # This will not raise an exception\n",
    "   except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "       print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Division successful!\")\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       print(\"This will always execute.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation**:\n",
    "   - **`else` Block**: Executes if no exception is raised in the `try` block.\n",
    "   - **`finally` Block**: Executes regardless of whether an exception was raised or not, often used for cleanup actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic syntax and usage of `try`-`except` blocks allow you to handle errors gracefully and ensure that your program can continue running or exit cleanly even if unexpected issues occur."

  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "If an exception occurs inside a `try` block and there is no matching `except` block to handle it, the exception will propagate (i.e., bubble up) to the calling code. If no higher-level code handles the exception, it will eventually terminate the program. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Propagation of Exception**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uncaught Exception**: If the `try` block raises an exception and there is no corresponding `except` block to handle that specific exception, the exception will continue to propagate up the call stack.\n",
    "- **Call Stack**: The exception will move up to the calling function or script. If the exception is not caught there, it will continue to propagate to the next higher level, eventually reaching the top level of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Program Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unhandled Exception**: If the exception propagates all the way to the top of the call stack and there are no `except` blocks to handle it, Python will print a traceback to the console and terminate the program.\n",
    "- **Traceback**: The traceback provides information about the sequence of function calls leading to the exception, which can be useful for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = x / y\n",
    "    # No except block here\n",
    "\n",
    "# This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "divide(10, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **Exception Raised**: The `divide` function attempts to divide by zero, which raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.\n",
    "- **No Handling**: Since there is no `except` block in the `divide` function to catch the exception, the error propagates to the caller.\n",
    "- **Program Termination**: If no higher-level code catches the exception, Python will display a traceback and terminate the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example with a Top-Level Exception Handler**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle exceptions at a higher level, you can use a `try`-`except` block around the function call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(x, y):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = x / y\n",
    "        print(f\"Result: {result}\")\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    divide(10, 0)\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- **In Function**: The `divide` function handles `ZeroDivisionError`, so it prints a specific error message and does not let the exception propagate further.\n",
    "- **Top-Level Handling**: If you had not handled the exception inside `divide`, you could catch it in the `try`-`except` block surrounding the function call, providing a final safeguard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exception Handling**: Always ensure that your code has appropriate `except` blocks to handle expected exceptions. This prevents your program from crashing due to unhandled exceptions.\n",
    "- **Error Debugging**: Use the traceback provided by Python to debug and fix issues causing exceptions."

    "\n",
    "- **Catches All Exceptions**: It catches every exception, including system exit exceptions, keyboard interrupts, and exceptions that are not derived from the base `Exception` class.\n",
    "- **Potential Risks**:\n",
    "  - **Masking Bugs**: It can inadvertently catch exceptions that you might want to handle differently or let propagate for debugging.\n",
    "  - **Hard to Debug**: Since it catches all exceptions, it can make debugging more difficult because you might not know what specific exception occurred.\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",

    "  - **Easier Debugging**: Helps in debugging since you handle known exceptions and let unknown ones propagate.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Contains code that may raise exceptions related to division operations (`x / y`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Nested within the outer `try` block, it attempts to convert the result of the division to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outer `except` Block**:\n",
    "   - Handles exceptions raised by the outer `try` block. For instance, `ZeroDivisionError` if dividing by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Inner `except` Block**:\n",
    "   - Handles exceptions specific to the inner `try` block. For example, `ValueError` if converting the result to an integer fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **General Exception Handling**:\n",
    "   - The outer block also has a general `except Exception` clause to handle any unexpected exceptions not specifically caught by the previous blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `divide_numbers(10, 2)`, both `try` blocks execute without exceptions, so the result is printed.\n",
    "- For `divide_numbers(10, 0)`, the outer `except` block catches the `ZeroDivisionError` and prints an error message.\n",
    "- For `divide_numbers(10, 3)`, the inner `try` block completes successfully without raising a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Nested `try`-`except` Blocks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Granular Error Handling**: Handle different types of exceptions in separate levels of the code.\n",
    "- **Localize Exception Handling**: Manage exceptions at the specific context where they might occur, making debugging easier.\n",
    "- **Organize Error Handling**: Maintain clear and organized exception handling logic by addressing different exceptions at appropriate levels.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **a. `EOFError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when an `input()` function call hits the end of the file (EOF) condition and no input is available. This can happen when trying to read beyond the end of a file or stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "sys.stdin = open('empty_file.txt', 'r')\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    input()\n",
    "except EOFError:\n",
    "    print(\"EOFError: Reached end of file while reading input.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **b. `FloatingPointError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when a floating-point operation fails, such as during invalid floating-point operations (e.g., overflow, division by zero in floating-point numbers). This is less common in Python unless explicitly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = math.exp(1000)  # This might cause an overflow\n",
    "except FloatingPointError:\n",
    "    print(\"FloatingPointError: Floating-point operation failed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Floating-point errors are often managed by the underlying hardware or system rather than being explicitly raised in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **c. `IndexError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when trying to access an index in a sequence (like a list or tuple) that is out of range. This occurs when the index is negative or exceeds the length of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_list[5])\n",
    "except IndexError:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **d. `MemoryError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when an operation runs out of memory. This typically happens when trying to allocate too much memory for a new object or data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    huge_list = [0] * (10**10)  # Attempting to allocate a massive list\n",
    "except MemoryError:\n",
    "    print(\"MemoryError: Ran out of memory.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **e. `OverflowError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when a numerical operation exceeds the range of a numeric type. This usually occurs with integers or floating-point numbers that grow beyond their maximum limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 ** 1000  # This can cause an overflow in some contexts\n",
    "except OverflowError:\n",
    "    print(\"OverflowError: Numeric operation exceeded limits.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **f. `TabError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when the Python interpreter encounters inconsistent use of tabs and spaces for indentation. This can lead to issues in code alignment, which Python enforces strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Assuming the file contains mixed tabs and spaces\n",
    "    with open('file_with_tabs_and_spaces.py') as f:\n",

    "except TabError:\n",
    "    print(\"TabError: Inconsistent use of tabs and spaces for indentation.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **g. `ValueError`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value, such as trying to convert a string that does not represent a number into an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    number = int(\"abc\")  # Invalid conversion\n",
