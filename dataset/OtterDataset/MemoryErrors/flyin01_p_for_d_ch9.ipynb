    "Most developers call application errors *exceptions* meanin that they are exception to the rule. The act of detecting and processing an exception is called *error handlig* or *exception handling*. It is important to know when to handle exeptions locally, when to send them to the code that called your code and when to create special excepctions so that every part of the application knows how to handle the exception. There are also times when you must handle exception s gracefully. Python provides ```finally``` clause, which always executes, even when exceptions occurs..  \n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying when errors occur. The two major time frames are:  \n",
    "* Compile time - these are easiest to spot and fix because the application wont run with compile-time errors like syntax error.\n",
    "* Runtime - not all  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Distinguishing erroro types. The trick is to know where to look for errors, Python breaks errors down to these types:  \n",
    "* Syntactical\n",
    "* Semtantic\n",
    "* Logical  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The easiest to find are usually syntactical, followed by semantic and hardest are the logical errors. Example:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Syntactical**  \n",
    "Some sort of code typo create a syntactical error, some of these are easy to find since the application wont run. Others are quite hard the reason for, Python is case sensistive and finding the one place where you used the wrong capitalization can be challenging.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Semantic**  \n",
    "When you create a loop that executes one too many times you usually dont get any sort of erroro information. The application may happily run since it thinks it is doing everything correctly, but the one additional loop can cause some sort of data errors. So code is correct but the implementaiton is wrong.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Logical**  \n",
    "Locigal errors occur when developer thinking is faulty. This can many times happen when relational operators are used incorrectly or in other ways like developer assumes the application will always use local data which means the app will behave in unusual way when accessing remote data. Locial problems can be quite hard to fix since the cause is not the actual code, more the code is incorrectly defined since the thought process that went into creating the code is faulty. Thus the developer who created it is less likely to find it. Using a second pair of eyes or pair review can help finding this erroros."

    "**Catching Exceptions**  \n",
    "Generally speaking, a user should never see an excepiton dialog box. Your application should always catch the exception and handle it before the user sees it. Of course, reality is different. But catching every potential exception is still the goal when developing an application.  \n",

    "* Base classes:  \n",
    "Provide essential building blocks like ```ArithmeticError``` exception  \n",
    "* Concrete exceptions:  \n",
    "Apps can experience hard errors. For example when system runs out of memory, ```MemoryError```. Recovering from this might be hard. When user presses interrupt key such as Ctrl+C or Delete, ```KeyboardInterrupt``` the app must handling this exception before proceeding.  \n",
    "* OS exceptions:  \n",
    "For example if application tries to open a file that doest not exists ```FileNotFoundError``` exception is raised.  \n",
    "* Warnings:  \n",
