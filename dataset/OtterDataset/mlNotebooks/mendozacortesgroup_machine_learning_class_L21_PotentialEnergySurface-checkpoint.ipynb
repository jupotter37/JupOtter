    "Understanding the energy of large molecules plays a central role in the study of chemical and biological systems. The potential-energy surface (PES) is the most basic quantity to describe a chemical system. It determines all its properties,and once the PES is known, these properties can be extracted by different types of computer simulations. The PES is defined as a function yielding the potential-energy of an atomic configuration if the atomic coordinates are provided. "
