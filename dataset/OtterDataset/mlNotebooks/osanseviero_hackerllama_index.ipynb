    "In this blog post, we'll do an end-to-end example of the math within a transformer model. The goal is to get a good understanding of how the model works. To make this manageable, we'll do lots of simplification. As we'll be doing quite a bit of the math by hand, we'll reduce the dimensions of the model. For example, rather than using embeddings of 512 values, we'll use embeddings of 4 values. This will make the math easier to follow! We'll use random vectors and matrices, but you can use your own values if you want to follow along.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see, the math is not that complicated. The complexity comes from the number of steps and the number of parameters. **I recommend you to read the [The Illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) blog before reading this blog post (or reading in parallel)**. It's a great blog post that explains the transformer model in a very intuitive (and illustrative!) way and I don't intend to explain what it's already explained there. My goal is to explain the \"how\" of the transformer model, not the \"what\". If you want to dive even deeper, check out the famous original paper: [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).\n",

    "The original transformer model has two parts: encoder and decoder. The encoder focus is in \"understanding\" or \"capturing the meaning\" of the input text, while the decoder focus is in generating the output text. We'll first focus on the encoder part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole goal of the encoder is to generate a rich embedding representation of the input text. This embedding will capture semantic information about the input, and will then be passed to the decoder to generate the output text. The encoder is composed of a stack of N layers. Before we jump into the layers, we need to see how to pass the words (or tokens) into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "Embeddings are a somewhat overused term. We'll first create an embedding that will be the input to the encoder. The encoder also outputs an embedding (also called hidden states sometimes). The decoder will also receive an embedding! 😅 The whole point of an embedding is to represent a token as a vector. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "ML models can process numbers, not text. soo we need to turn our input text into numbers. That's what **tokenization** does! This is the process of splitting the input text into tokens, each with an associated ID. For example, we could split the text \"Hello World\" into two tokens: \"Hello\" and \"World\". We could also split it into characters: \"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\", \" \", \"W\", \"o\", \"r\", \"l\", \"d\". The choice of tokenization is up to us and depends on the data we're working with. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word-based tokenization (splitting the text into words) will require a very large **vocabulary** (all possible tokens). It will also represent words like \"dog\" and \"dogs\" or \"run\" and \"running\" as different tokens. Character-based vocabulary will require a smaller vocabulary, but will provide less meaning (in can be useful for languages such as Chinese where each character carries more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "The field has moved towards subword tokenization. This is a middle ground between word-based and character-based tokenization. We'll split the words into subwords. For example, we could split \"tokenization\" into \"token\" and \"ization\". How do we decide how to split the words? This is part of training a tokenizer through a statistical process that tries to identify which subwords are the best to pick given a dataset. It's a deterministic process (unlike training a ML model).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this blog post, let's go with word tokenization for simplicity. Our goal will be to translate \"Hello World\" from English to Spanish. Given an example \"Hello World\", we'll split into tokens: \"Hello\" and \"World\". Each token has an associated ID defined in the model's vocabulary. For example, \"Hello\" could be token 1 and \"World\" could be token 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Embedding the text\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we could pass the token IDs to the model (e.g. 1 and 2), these numbers don't carry any meaning. We need to turn them into vectors (list of numbers). This is what **embedding** does! The token embeddings map a token ID to a fixed-size vector with some **semantic meaning** of the tokens**. This brings some interesting properties: similar tokens will have a similar embedding (in other words, calculating the cosine similarity between two embeddings will give us a good idea of how similar the tokens are). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the mapping from a token to an embedding is learned. Although we could use a pre-trained embedding such as word2vec or GloVe, transformers models learn these embeddings as part of their training. This is a big advantage as the model can learn the best representation of the tokens for the task at hand. For example, the model could learn that \"dog\" and \"dogs\" should have similar embeddings. \n",
    "\n",
    "All embeddings in a single model have the same size. The original transformer used a size of 512, but let's do 4 for our example so we can keep the maths manageable. I'll assign some random values to each token (as mentioned, this mapping is usually learned by the model).\n",

In practice, these numbers would be learned by the model. I've updated the blog post to make this clearer. Thanks to everyone who raised this question!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate how similar these vectors are using cosine similarity, which would be too high for the vectors above. In practice, a vector would likely look something like [-0.071, 0.344, -0.12, 0.026, ..., -0.008].\n",

Sine and cosine functions have a wave-like pattern, and they repeat over time. By using these functions, **each position in the sentence gets a unique** yet consistent positional encoding. Given they repeat over time, it can help the model more easily learn patterns like proximity and distance between elements. These are the functions they use in the paper (section 3.5):\n",

This issue of having values that are too high is a common issue when training models. For example, when doing the backpropagation (the technique through which the models learn), the gradients can become too large and end up exploding; this is called **gradient explosion**. Without any kind of normalization, small changes in the input of early layers end up being amplified in later layers. This is a common problem in deep neural networks. There are two common techniques to mitigate this problem: residual connections and layer normalization (section 3.1 of the paper, barely mentioned).\n",

    "I hope that was fun and informational! We covered a lot of ground. Wait...was that it? And the answer is, mostly, yes! New transformer architectures add lots of tricks, but the core of the transformer is what we just covered. Depending on what task you want to solve, you can also only the encoder or the decoder. For example, for understanding-heavy tasks such as classification, you can use the encoder stack with a linear layer on top. For generation-heavy tasks such as translation, you can use the encoder and decoder stacks. And finally, for free generation, as in ChatGPT or Mistral, you can use only the decoder stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we also did lots of simplifications. Let's briefly check which were the numbers in the original transformer paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embedding dimension: 512 (4 in our example)\n",
    "* Number of encoders: 6 (6 in our example)\n",
    "* Number of decoders: 6 (6 in our example)\n",
    "* Feed-forward dimension: 2048 (8 in our example)\n",
    "* Number of attention heads: 8 (2 in our example)\n",
    "* Attention dimension: 64 (3 in our example)\n",
    "\n",
    "We just covered lots of topics, but it's quite interesting we can achieve impressive results by scaling up this math and doing smart training. We didn't cover training in this blog post as the goal was to understand the math when using an existing model, but I hope this provided strong foundations for jumping into the training part. I hope you enjoyed this blog post! \n",
