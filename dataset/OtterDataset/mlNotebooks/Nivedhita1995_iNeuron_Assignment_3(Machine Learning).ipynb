    "\n",
    "-> Supervised Learning:\n",
    "Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled examples, where both input data and corresponding target outputs are provided. \n",
    "The goal is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen input data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. \n",
    "Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks such as classification, regression, and time series prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Unsupervised Learning:\n",
    "Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data, without any specified target outputs. \n",
    "The goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. Clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering, group similar data points together. \n",
    "Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE, reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its important features. \n",
    "Unsupervised learning is useful for tasks such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Reinforcement Learning:\n",
    "Reinforcement learning involves an agent interacting with an environment and learning from feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. \n",
    "The agent learns through trial and error, exploring different actions to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning and policy gradients, are used to train agents in dynamic and uncertain environments. Reinforcement learning has applications in autonomous systems, game playing, robotics, and optimization problems.\n",

    "-> Semi-Supervised Learning:\n",
    "Semi-supervised learning utilizes a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for training. In many real-world scenarios, obtaining labeled data can be expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "Algorithms such as self-training, co-training, and multi-view learning are commonly used in semi-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Online Learning:\n",
    "Online learning, also known as incremental learning, involves continuously updating a model as new data becomes available, rather than retraining the model from scratch. \n",
    "Online learning is useful when the data arrives in a streaming or sequential manner and the model needs to adapt to changing patterns. \n",
    "Examples of online learning algorithms include online gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and adaptive learning rate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Transfer Learning:\n",
    "Instead of starting from scratch, transfer learning allows models to benefit from pre-trained models or features. For example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on a large image dataset for image classification can be fine-tuned for a specific image recognition task with a smaller labeled dataset."
