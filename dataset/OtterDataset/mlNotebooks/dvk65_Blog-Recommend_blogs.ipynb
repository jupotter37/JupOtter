He started his Data Science journey by doing a free course on Quantra, which teaches in an interactive way the steps to predict the EPL winner based on data (obviously ideal for him!).\\nFor Your Information: We are currently building an online careers portal - datasciencejobslondon for those who are aspiring to work within big data or who already work within the field and are looking for careers specifically within the areas of data science, machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, big data and statistics.
