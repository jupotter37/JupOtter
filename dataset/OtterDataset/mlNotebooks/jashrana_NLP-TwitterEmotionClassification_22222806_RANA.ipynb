        "For this assignment, we will explore Twitter Emotion Classification. The goal is the identify the primary emotion expressed in a tweet. Consider the following tweets:\n",
        "```\n",
        "Tweet 1: @NationalGallery @ThePoldarkian I have always loved this painting.\n",
        "Tweet 2: '@tateliverpool #BobandRoberta: I am angry more artists that have a profile are not speaking up #foundationcourses.'\n",
        "``` \n",
        "\n",
        "How would you describe the emotions in `Tweet 1` vs `Tweet 2`? `Tweet 1` expresses enjoyment and happiness, while `Tweet 2` directly expresses anger. For this assignment, we will be working with the SMILE Twitter Emotion Dataset ([Wang et al. 2016](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1619/paper3.pdf)). At a high level, our goal is to develop different models (rule-based, machine learning, and deep learning), which can be used to identify the emotion of a tweet. You will be required to clean and preprocess the data, generate features for classification, train various models, and evaluate the models. \n",

We'll start with implementing a simple rule-based classifier which will also serve as our naive baseline. Emotive language (e.g. awesome, feel great, super happy) can be a strong signal as to the overall emotion being by the tweet. For each emotion in our label space (happy, surprised, sad, angry) we will generate a set of words and phrases that are often associated with that emotion. At classification time, the classifier will calculate a score based on the overlap between the words in the tweet and the emotive words and phrases for each of the emotions. The emotion label with the highest overlap will be selected as the prediction and if there is no match the \"no-emotion\" label will be predicted. We can break the implementation of this rules-based classifier into three steps:\n",

        "1. After seeing all the three models fail on the labels \"sad\" and \"surprise\" due to its lack of training data, I'd say it would go for BERT Transformer route as it still gives us better performance score compared to other two, due to the reason that it provides good weights and bias to the internal nodes on which it determines the result, as compared to RandomForestClassifier and the Rule-based model which has fixed set of defined functions and no learning or shifting of the parameters is taking place. It takes the least time out of the three but performs with very underwhelming results out of the three.\n",
        "<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "2. \n",
        "* Rule-Based model implemented has a fixed set of words which shows us a bag of words implementation of an NLP task, which can be good if we have a small program allocated for a smaller scale use, but lacks where a word can mean different things in correlation to others or the sentence itself. The model gives us an accuracy of 48% which is very average considering the training and testing size.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Machine Learning w/ POS features using RandomForestClassifier is still an ideal choice with accuracy around 77% and w/o POS accuracy of 81% which still gives a good ideology of the fact that we can still use them to opt, and can change the hyperparameters or can even do better preprocessing work or use a good lexical database to support our database for preprocessing, to crux the results to even better scale, while it takes considerably less time than the Transformers and comes closer to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Transformers use GPU to process the data, train and run them with a considerably high accuracy out of the tree at a whopping 87% which is a good performance score in a broad subject like NLP, but requires a good knowledge of the subject and even a bigger corpus of data to transform and encode the data. It becomes good as the data is transformed into numbers because a system works well if numbers are provided to it for processing, and that's what is achieved here. The weights and biases for each node in the layers are well set according to the inputs provided and it is a big reason for this method to work the best, although a lot is required to set metrics using PyTorch."
