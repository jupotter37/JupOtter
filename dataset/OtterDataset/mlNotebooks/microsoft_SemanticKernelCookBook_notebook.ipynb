       "  'content': \"The history of machine learning and artificial intelligence is marked by notable discoveries and periods of significant progress and setbacks. Key discoveries include Bayes Theorem (1763, 1812), Least Square Theory (1805), Markov Chains (1913), Perceptron (1957), Nearest Neighbor (1967), Backpropagation (1970), and Recurrent Neural Networks (1982). The concept of a 'machine that can think' was introduced by Alan Turing in 1950. The Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956 was a seminal event for AI as a field. The period from 1956 to 1974 is often referred to as 'The golden years' of AI. However, by the mid-1970s, the complexity of creating 'intelligent machines' had been understated and its promise overblown, leading to an 'AI Winter'. The 1980s saw the proliferation of 'expert systems'. The period from 1993 to 2011 saw a new era for ML and AI with the rapid increase of data and compute power. Today, machine learning and AI touch almost every part of our lives.\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"The process of machine learning involves several steps. First, a question is decided that cannot be answered by a simple conditional program. Data is then collected and prepared, which includes visualizing the data and splitting it into training and testing groups. A training method is chosen based on the question and the nature of the data. The model is then trained using various algorithms to recognize patterns in the data. The model is evaluated using never before seen data from the collected set. Based on the performance of the model, the process can be redone using different parameters. Finally, new inputs are used to test the accuracy of the model. Before building the model, several tasks need to be completed such as collecting and preparing data, selecting features and target, visualizing data, and splitting the dataset. The model is then built using the training data and various algorithms. The model's quality is evaluated using test data. The quality of the model can be improved by tweaking its 'hyperparameters'. Finally, completely new data is used to test the model's accuracy.\"},\n",
