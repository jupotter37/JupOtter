Aside from the pragmatic strategy of increasing the number of basis functions, we can also achieve more flexibility by replacing the basis functions with parametric functions.

    "The flexibility of a feedforward neutral network can be adapted by varying the number of neurons per hidden layer, or by adding more hidden layers. Both options lead to an increase in the number of parameters $\\mathbf{w}$. When a neural network has too few parameters, it generally puts us at risk of underfitting the data, whereas having too many parameters can quickly lead to overfitting. Since they control model complexity, the number of layers and neurons per layer are therefore hyperparameters, which need to be calibrated. Once again, remember that **hyperparameters are calibrated with validation data**. Simply minimizing training error w.r.t. these hyperparameters will always lead to huge and severely overfit models, especially when we do not have a lot of data available.\n",

    "The example above is a good illustration of overfitting. Note how the training loss almost immediately becomes an unreliable estimate of the true expected loss (black line). In contrast, the validation loss (purple line) does not exactly agree with the black line but consistently follows the same trends. Crucially, **the validation loss correctly points to the model with the lowest true loss**, at around $3000$ training epochs. Move the model selection slider there and try to see why the true loss starts to increase from that point on. \n",

    "It is possible to train a neural network for a long time, and then select the $\\mathbf{w}$ that corresponds to the lowest validation error.

However, in order to properly implement early stopping, keep track of our validation loss and see which mini-batches are being picked, we could code our own training loop.

    "In these videos you have seen a non-parametric model, namely k-nearest neighbours, and have learned about the bias-variance trade-off. Linear regression was shown as a parametric model that is linear in its parameters and has a closed form solution. Ridge regression has been introduced to prevent overfitting. Stochastic gradient descent has been shown as a way to train a model in an iterative fashion. In this final chapter, we explored a model with a nonlinear dependence on its parameters. You now understand the underlying principles of a broad set machine learning techniques, and know how to distinguish naive curve fitting from extracting (or learning) the relevant trends and patterns in data."
