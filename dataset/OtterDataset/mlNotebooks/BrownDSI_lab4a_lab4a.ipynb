    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be asked to make [ER diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) and star schemas. You will learn to identify the key elements in data preprocessing to make it more structured and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Objective **\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand modeling of data, which is a key data preprocessing step in the data pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Tasks **\n",
    "1. To draw an entity relationship (ER) Diagram.\n",
    "1. To design a star schema\n",

    "** Note **\n",
    "We recommended using [Google Drawings](https://drawings.google.com), which is an online image creator that can be used to draw ER diagrams and schemas."
