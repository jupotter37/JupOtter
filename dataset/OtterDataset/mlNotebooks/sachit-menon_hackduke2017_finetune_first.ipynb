    "You might we wondering, what's going on with that *activation* parameter? Adding an 'activation' parameter to a layer in Keras causes an additional function to be called after the layer is calculated. You'll recall that we had no such parameter in our most basic linear model at the start of this lesson - that's because a simple linear model has no *activation function*. But nearly all deep model layers have an activation function - specifically, a *non-linear* activation function, such as tanh, sigmoid (```1/(1+exp(x))```), or relu (```max(0,x)```, called the *rectified linear* function). Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that if you stack purely linear layers on top of each other, then you just end up with a linear layer! For instance, if your first layer was ```2*x```, and your second was ```-2*x```, then the combination is: ```-2*(2*x) = -4*x```. If that's all we were able to do with deep learning, it wouldn't be very deep! But what if we added a relu activation after our first layer? Then the combination would be: ```-2 * max(0, 2*x)```. As you can see, that does not simplify to just a linear function like the previous example--and indeed we can stack as many of these on top of each other as we wish, to create arbitrarily complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And why would we want to do that? Because it turns out that such a stack of linear functions and non-linear activations can approximate any other function just as close as we want. So we can **use it to model anything**! This extraordinary insight is known as the *universal approximation theorem*. For a visual understanding of how and why this works, I strongly recommend you read Michael Nielsen's [excellent interactive visual tutorial](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html)."

Our classication problems will always have this form, so we will introduce the activation function that has these properties: the *softmax* function. Softmax is defined as (for the i'th output activation): ```exp(x[i]) / sum(exp(x))```.\n",
