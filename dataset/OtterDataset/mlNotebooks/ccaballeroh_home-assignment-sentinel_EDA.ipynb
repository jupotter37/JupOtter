      "Can pets spread COVID-19?\n",
      "There is no evidence to suggest pets, such as cats and dogs, can be infected or transmit the coronavirus. Regularly washing your hands with soap and water after touching your beloved moggy or pooch will help stop the spread of bacteria that they commonly carry, such as E. coli and salmonella.\n",
      "Can the corona virus be transmitted via air mail?\n",
      "People receiving parcels from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus, as the virus does not survive long on objects. Due to the poor survivability of the coronavirus on surfaces, there is a very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks.\n",

      "The new coronavirus needs its own vaccine. Pneumonia vaccines such as the pneumococcal and the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine will not protect you against the coronavirus.\n",
      "Do bleach products protect you?\n",
      "Bleach/chlorine-based disinfectants, solvents, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform can kill the 2019-nCoV on hard surfaces; however, they have little or no impact if you put them on your skin.\n",
      "Avoid direct contact!\n",
      "To avoid a coronavirus infection, always cook raw foods thoroughly. It is also advisable to avoid direct contact with people who are sick.\n",

      "Frequently washing your hands with soap and water can help prevent an infection. You can also use an alcohol-based sanitizing gel instead. If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow. If you have contracted the disease without knowing it, coughing or sneezing in this manner might help to reduce the spread.\n",

    "Although the corpus is balanced among the two classes: real and disinformation news, it is not at all balanced regarding the sources of the news.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of fake news detection (whether they are with the purpose of entertainment--as The Onion outlet--or to misinform or disinform) is a hard problem due to the nature of the classfication task. The veracity of a text depends on facts that are external to the text. There have been attempts to incorporate external evidence (Popat et. al., 2018) and also to check if there are stylistic features inherent to fake news (Rashkin et. al., 2017) to address this problem, but in general it is still an open problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first intuition in order to check whether a piece of news text is real or \"fake\" is to check the source of the text. We can attempt to build a sort of black list of websites known to be sources of disinformation. However, the number of credible sites is too small and the task would be trivial and would not scale well. Another idea would be to train a classifier with character *n*-grams out of the URLs of the news segment to try to classify a news outleat as credible or not (only in case there is a pattern to be found by Machine Learning).\n",

    "Another approach and as a proof of concept we can fine tune a language model such as BERT in a text classification task. That is presented in [this notebook.](./Classification.ipynb)"
