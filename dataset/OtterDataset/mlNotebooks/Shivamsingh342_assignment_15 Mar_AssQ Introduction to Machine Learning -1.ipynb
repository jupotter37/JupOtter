    "Labeled Data: Supervised learning relies on labeled data, where each instance in the training set is associated with a known target or output label.\n",
    "Learning Goal: The goal is to learn a mapping between the input features and the corresponding output labels to make predictions or classify new, unseen instances accurately.\n",

    "Training Process: Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to uncover hidden patterns or group similar instances based on intrinsic properties of the data.\n",
    "Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection are typical applications of unsupervised learning.\n",
    "Semi-Supervised Learning:\n",

    "Validation Set:\n",
    "Definition: The validation set is an optional subset of the dataset used for model selection and hyperparameter tuning during the training process.\n",
    "Importance: The validation set allows for fine-tuning the model's performance by comparing different variations or configurations of the model. It helps in selecting the best-performing model and tuning hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) to optimize the model's performance on unseen data. Using a separate validation set helps prevent overfitting, as it provides an independent evaluation of the model's performance during training.\n"
