This includes reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.\n","\n","Example: A chatbot that understands and responds to human language can be considered AI. It processes input, understands the context, and generates responses.\n","\n","Machine Learning (ML)\n","ML is a subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable systems to improve their performance on a task over time with experience (data). ML systems learn patterns from data rather than following explicitly programmed instructions.\n","\n","Example: Email spam filtering uses ML to learn from a dataset of spam and non-spam emails. The model then predicts whether new emails are spam or not.\n","\n","Deep Learning (DL)\n","DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data. DL is particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.\n","\n","Example: An image recognition system that identifies objects in photos uses a deep neural network trained on thousands of labeled images.\n","\n","Q2: What is Supervised Learning? Examples\n","Supervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on labeled data. This means that each training example includes input data as well as the correct output.\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","Classification: Identifying whether an email is spam or not.\n","Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.\n","Object Detection: Identifying and categorizing objects in images.\n","Q3: What is Unsupervised Learning? Examples\n","Unsupervised learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and structure from the data itself.\n","\n","Examples:\n","\n","Clustering: Grouping customers into segments based on purchasing behavior.\n","Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns in data, such as fraudulent transactions.\n","Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in a dataset, such as using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\n","Q4: Differences Between AI, ML, DL, and DS\n","Artificial Intelligence (AI): The broadest field, encompassing the creation of intelligent systems.\n","Machine Learning (ML): A subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data.\n","Deep Learning (DL): A subset of ML that uses deep neural networks.\n","Data Science (DS): An interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.\n","Q5: Differences Between Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning\n","Supervised Learning:\n","\n","Data: Labeled data\n","Purpose: Predict outcomes for new data\n","Example: Classification, Regression\n","Unsupervised Learning:\n","\n","Data: Unlabeled data\n","Purpose: Find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures\n","Example: Clustering, Anomaly Detection\n","Semi-Supervised Learning:\n","\n","Data: A mix of labeled and unlabeled data\n","Purpose: Improve learning accuracy with fewer labeled examples\n","Example: Combining a small labeled dataset with a large unlabeled dataset for training\n","Q6: Train, Test, and Validation Split\n","Training Set: The subset of data used to train the model. The model learns from this data.\n","Validation Set: A separate set used to tune model parameters and avoid overfitting. It helps in model selection and hyperparameter tuning.\n","Test Set: The subset of data used to evaluate the final model's performance. It provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's effectiveness.\n","Importance:\n","\n","Training Set: Enables the model to learn patterns.\n","Validation Set: Helps in tuning the model and preventing overfitting.\n","Test Set: Provides an estimate of the model's generalization to unseen data.\n","Q7: Unsupervised Learning in Anomaly Detection\n","Unsupervised learning can identify anomalies by finding data points that do not fit the general pattern. Algorithms like clustering (e.g., k-means) or dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) can be used to detect these outliers.\n","\n","Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial datasets where fraudulent patterns differ significantly from normal patterns.\n","\n","Q8: Commonly Used Supervised and Unsupervised Learnin"],"metadata":{"id":"_gun7RYfzJ0i"}}]}
