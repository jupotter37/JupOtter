      "Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (ARVD) is an unresolved therapeutic dilemma despite extensive pre-clinical and clinical studies. The pathophysiology of the disease has been widely studied, and many factors that may be involved in progressive renal injury and cardiovascular risk associated with ARVD have been identified. However, therapies and clinical trials have focused largely on attempts to resolve renal artery stenosis without considering the potential need to treat the renal parenchyma beyond the obstruction. The results of these trials show a staggering consistence: although nearly 100% of the patients undergoing renal angioplasty show a resolution of the vascular obstruction, they do not achieve significant improvements in renal function or blood pressure control compared with those patients receiving medical treatment alone. It seems that we may need to take a step back and reconsider the pathophysiology of the disease in order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. This mini-review discusses potential therapeutic alternatives that focus on the renal parenchyma distal to the vascular obstruction and may provide additional tools to enhance current treatment of ARVD.\n"
