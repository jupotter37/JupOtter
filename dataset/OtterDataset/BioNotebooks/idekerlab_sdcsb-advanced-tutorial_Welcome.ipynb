    "### Background\n",
    "Welcome to the __Advanced Cytoscape__ tutorial session!  [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) is a powerful tool for biological network data analysis and visualization and it is a de-facto standard tool in systems biology community.  However, no one can complete their data visualization workflow only with a tool.  In fact, there is no _one-size-fits-all_ type tool for modern biology.  This means there is a need to __glue__ multiple tools and make them work nicely together to visualize complex data sets.  [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a perfect programming language for this purpose.  In this tutorial, we will use IPython Notebook as an _electronic lab notebook_ for your data analysis and visualization workflow with Cytoscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to learn the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basics of IPython Notebook\n",
    "    * Navigation\n",
    "* Cytoscape RESTful API basics\n",
    "    * Import/create networks\n",
    "    * Create Visual Styles\n",
    "    * Using external web services\n",
    "* Data visualization with IPython Notebook and Cytoscape\n",
    "    * Generate reusable Styles with Python\n",
    "    * Embed interactive visualization using cytoscape.js widget\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of RESTful API\n",
    "    * [This is a good introduction to REST](http://www.restapitutorial.com/)\n",
    "* Basic Python skill - only basics, such as conditional statements, loops, basic data types.\n",
    "* Basic knowledge of Cytoscape\n",
    "    * Cytoscape data types - Networks, Tables, and Styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "__You don't have to worry too much about Python.  Building simple data analysis workflows requires only basic knowledge of Python.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://cl.ly/aftK/docker_logo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All required software packages to run these lessons are packed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container for your convenience.  Docker is a powerful tool to make your workflow reproducible, but it is not the main forcus of this course.  I strongly recommend to use Docker to run your notebook server, but if you want to build on your machine, install the following to try these notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3\n",
    "* IPython Notebook\n",
    "* requests\n",
    "* py2cytoscape\n",
    "* pandas\n",
    "* NetworkX\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if you use the [Docker container we provide](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/idekerlab/vizbi-2015/), you don't have to install any of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorials\n",

    "* [Lesson 1: Introduction to Cytoscape RESTful API (cyREST)](tutorials/Lesson_1_Introduction_to_cyREST.ipynb)\n",
