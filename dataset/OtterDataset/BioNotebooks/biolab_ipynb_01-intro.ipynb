    "[Bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) is about application of methods from computer science to help us understand biology. With it, we try to understand life and processes that makes us alive. In the past couple of decades, biologists have invented tools and technologies that can measure many different aspects of biology and dissect the living units of life at the molecular level. This data should help us to understand life at its very basic, molecular level, and to integrate this understanding all the way up to the level of the organisms. As computer engineer, you probably know that data requires storage, representation, and then algorithms for the analysis and visualisation and support of interpretation. In the view of the lecturers of this course, bioinformatics will be viewed as a tool for data analysis, and the course will be about methods support of biologists to gain understanding of their data that they can today collect in abundance."

    "### The Cell\n",
    "We will start by thinking of what makes us alive. Today we know that there are many different types organisms, including animals, plants, fungi and microorganisms. They are all alive because they bear some characteristics that are common to all of them and which are not present in stuff that is not alive. Living organisms can grow, they develop, reproduce, react to the stimuli and maintain their internal state (like, we human, try too keep our body at around 37 degrees Centigrade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Building blocks of life are [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)). There are organisms where a single cell is all there is (unicellular organisms) and multicellular organisms where the cells cooperate and together form an organism. We, human, are made of $6\\times 10^{13}$ cells. That is 60,000,000,000,000 cells. Compare this to about 300 billion of stars in Milky Way: there are about 200 times more cells in our body than there are stars in the Milky Way. And Milky Way is a quite a big galaxy. Interestingly, though, there are only 200 different types of cells in our body.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Cells die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis). In our body, about 96,000,000 human cells die each minute. The lifespan of cells much depends on their type. White blood cells live for about 13 days. Top layer skin stays with us for a month. The lifespan of red blood cells is 120 days. And liver cells live for about year and a half.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already mentioned that we can classify organisms based on the number of cells they contain to multicellular and unicellular. Unicellular organisms are particularly interesting to biologists because it may be simpler to investigate a single cell than an organism with myriads of cells. Unicellular organisms can be further split to [eukaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote) and [prokaryotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryote), where the biggest visual (ok, microscopic) difference is in the part of the cell that is [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_nucleus). Namely, prokaryotes lack any membrane-bound organelle, a specialized subunit within the cell that carries out a specific function.\n",

Proteins are large biomolecules that are typically composed of thousands or more of atoms. They are building blocks of cells, or speed-up (catalyze) chemical reactions, or form membranes. The rest (10%) are small molecules that include sugars, fatty acids, signal transmission molecules, and molecules that are sources of energy or are used to store energy. For bioinformatics, it is the proteins that we will be most interested in, and is actually the proteins that are the engine of any processes in the cell and that make us alive."

The actual three-dimensional structure of the protein is given by its tertiary structure.

    "To dive a bit deeper in trying to understand what is the role of proteins in the cell, consider [glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis). This is one of the essential processes and occurs in nearly all organisms. It starts with a glucose which is converted to a simpler molecule, pyruvate in a sequnce of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The free energy released in this process is stored in high-energy compounds called [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). To simplify, glycolysis converts sugar into energy that is stored in the cell. Following is the schematic presentation of reactions that take place."

Glycolysis is then a metabolic pathway. All the reactions in glycolysis are catalyzed by enzymes - proteins, that push the reaction which without them would not take place. Proteins in this pathway (and elsewhere) have strange names that for computer scientists are almost impossible to remember. Say, to convert glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate the reaction involves an enzyme called phosphofructo kinase. Luckily, we will not need to remember any of these, but it is at this stage essential to know that almost no reaction in living organisms would take place without the proteins. Proteins are therefore essential part of the metabolic pathways, and these are what makes the cells alive."

In eukaryotes, DNA is tightly packed and stored in the nucleus of the cell. DNA comes in the form of a double helix, with two complementary strands.

DNA, or better, a small subsequence of DNA, that, a part of its chain, has a recipe for the protein. This recipe has first to emerge from the nucleus and then has to arrive to the ribosome. The carrier molecule is called RNA, a ribonucleic acid. To preserve energy and not make too much mess, mother nature figured out that it would be best if only the part of the DNA that encodes for the amino acid sequence that makes the protein is to be copied to RNA. This copying is called transcription. RNA (called messenger RNA for its function) then travels from nucleus to the ribosome, where the sequence of aminoacids is translated into a sequence of proteins."

If we would have words made of two nucleotides, they would encode for $4\\times 4$ different aminoacids. Not enough, we have twenty to provide encoding for. So we need at least three-letter words, or a sequence of three nucleotides. And in fact through evolution a language with three-letter words emerged, each word encoding for one of the amino acids.
