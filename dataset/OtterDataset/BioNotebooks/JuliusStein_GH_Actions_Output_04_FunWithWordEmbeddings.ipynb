    "# Fun With Word Embeddings --\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings (or \"word vectors\") are mappings from discrete word tokens (e.g., the word \"kitten\") to numerical vectors, e.g., a 50-dimensional vector of real numbers. The goal is for words that are related (such as \"scared\" and \"afraid\") to map to points that are close together in the 50-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These continous representations for words have proven very helpful in many NLP tasks. For example, they can help deal with synonyms that would otherwise have been considered totally unrelated in the bag of words approach to representing documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches for finding such an embedding. One approach is to analyze the contexts that words appear in over a large corpus and then find embeddings that map words with similar contexts to similar points in the space. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "    I am scared of dogs.\n",
    "    I am scared of bees.\n",
    "    I am afraid of dogs.\n",
    "    I am afraid of bees.\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The words \"scared\" and \"afraid\" both appear in the contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"I am ... of dogs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"I am ... of bees\"\n",
    "\n",
    "so it's likely that the words are related in some way. The relationship can be semantic (related to meaning) or syntactic (e.g., often occur between a determiner and a noun) In this case, \"scared\" and \"afraid\" are related semantically (similar meaning) and also syntactically (both adjectives).\n",
    "\n",
    "One really neat thing that researchers discovered is that word embeddings can be used to solve analogies, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"puppy\" is to \"dog\" as \"kitten\" is to ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazingly, this kind of puzzle can be solved by doing computations on word vectors:\n",
    "````python\n",
    "wv[\"kitten\"] - wv[\"puppy\"] + wv[\"dog\"]\n",
    "````    \n",
    "and finding the most similar word to the result, `wv[\"cat\"]` in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that the vector `(wv[\"dog\"] - wv[\"puppy\"])` represents a direction in the space the often takes the youth version of a concept to the adult version. So starting with \"kitten\" and moving in that direction winds up in an area of the space similar to \"cat\"."
