       "This research paper explores the inherent non-dependability of natural phenomena through the lens of the Naive Bayes algorithm, a fundamental statistical tool in machine learning. The Naive Bayes algorithm operates under the assumption that features are conditionally independent given the class label. This assumption, while often violated in real-world scenarios, serves as a critical framework for understanding the complexities of natural systems. By analyzing various datasets that represent natural processes, we demonstrate instances where the independence assumption leads to surprisingly accurate predictions, thereby highlighting the limitations of traditional models that rely on interdependent feature relationships. Our findings suggest that the apparent reliability of Naive Bayes in certain contexts underscores the unpredictable nature of complex systems, where underlying dependencies may be obscured. This paper contributes to the discourse on the unpredictability of nature by illustrating how machine learning models can yield insights even when foundational assumptions do not hold, ultimately questioning the extent to which we can depend on deterministic interpretations of natural phenomena. \n",
