    "It’s just Nasr and I in the house this cold December morning –it is a freezing  63 degrees.  Remember, winter looks different in California .This year has been filled with new opportunities, new beginnings, so many memories and lots of joy.\r\n",
    "Nasr—now considered a senior citizen—has had several job offers across the world.  One offer he is taking quite seriously is an opportunity to help start up a brand new university in Abu Dhabi—yes that very wealthy city state on the Arabian peninsula. We flew first class and didn’t feel the 18 hour trip. We stayed in Shangri-La—yes , it was a magical place and palace—lots of Indian food, and exotic Indian music—remember India is just a stone’s throw across the Arabian Sea.   We would live in ultimate luxury 25 floors above the vibrant blue sea with a view of the palace and an old city growing into a modern metropolis.  Oh, the job is going to be very exciting and extremely demanding on Nasr’s time.  However, two important things are missing—our wonderful family and friends.  Both Nasr and I are trying to eat a little healthier, but  I think Nasr takes the need to eat healthy to a new extreme.  He loves the all you can eat salad restaurants—you know as well as I do, that there is a lot more than salads there.  There may not be a lot of protein, but there are tons of carbs.  So, we were walking into the restaurant and Nasr kept hiking up his trousers.  He grinned sheepishly and quickly admitted that he wasn’t wearing a belt so he could eat as much “salad” as he wanted and wouldn’t be uncomfortable.  Isn’t the purpose of a salad bar to eat less?  Nasr has read the research and knows that we have to keep our brains active to prevent any unwanted memory loss.  So, he has taken up chess and he plays it every night before he sleeps on his iphone. Oh, he also plays it every time he gets a chance, so don’t assume when he opens up his ipad or iphone that he is working, he is most likely playing chess.  Now, Nasr hates to lose, so it is really important that computers have an undo button—which he uses often.  He has to win.  He sets the level of difficulty carefully so he assures his win.  He cannot sleep until he hears the computer shout “hooray!!!”  Once I hear the cheer, he happily  turns off the light and sleeps soundly.  \r\n",

    "Virginia loves being “Teta.”   That “G” word that ends with “ma”  gives me a little difficulty.  When I look around and see a grey haired little old lady, she is a grandma—me, I’m a Teta.  This summer I had a chance to visit my amazing granddaughter and then again during the week long Thanksgiving break.  It is fantastic having all the fun and none of the responsibilities!!!  Why didn’t I do this earlier—oh yeah, my kids had to have kids first—no pressure kids—but I like being Teta.  We did travel this summer and we went down under to Sydney, Australia.  When you look at a map, that continent/country is truly tucked under the lower half of the globe.  Well, when you walk in Australia—you are truly upside down—and gravity has to work very ,very hard to keep you on the ground.  I could feel gravity at its best.  My calves and legs ached from the pull of the gravity.  Now, some of you may be raising your eyebrows, but I swear I could feel gravity holding me down and it told me I had to lose some weight before I go back or my legs won’t be able to handle the gravity of the situation.  In spite of the triple dose of gravity, Australia is beautiful and the people are warm, kind and funny.  We saw the Blue Mountains, called so because the eucalyptus trees secrete an oil that gives the mountains a bluish color.  I held a koala, petted a kangaroo and a saw herds of them in the wild—no I did not pet a wild one.   Many people thought we were crazy to travel one week before our huge summer event, but the event of the year went off without a hitch.   You know how difficult it is to find the perfect dress for special events.  Well, I found a pastel green gown that looked “pretty.”  As we were driving home, Jasmine suggested that in order to make the dress look a little better on me, as I looked too pale in the dress,  she could find a place that would paint my skin a little darker so the dress would look better.  Paint my skin? Who changes the color of their skin to match a dress?   Needless to say, I returned the dress and got a vibrant blue and no, I did NOT paint my skin.\r\n",

    "Amira, Matthew and Siena (15 months) are a very active family.  Siena ran her first 5k run in October. Not too many one year olds run races, but she is an awesome granddaughter.  Ok, I will fess up, Siena didn’t use her legs—she sat comfortably in the stroller while mom and dad ran in the truly cold weather—they live in Virginia.   While they were visiting in August, Siena wasn’t quite walking, but she got around very well while hanging onto grandparents, aunts, uncles, mom, and dad.  All the adults needed Ben Gay for their aching backs, but she had a chance to explore the house, backyard and get up close and personal to the cats and dogs.  Siena is talking up a storm.   I think her first words after dad were cat and dog.  I’m not sure she knew the difference between the two since Adam’s dog is smaller than a cat.  Now, she has quite an extensive vocabulary.  When asks what a tiger says, she uses her deepest voice to say “ AAARRRR”. Siena is very outgoing and loves to say “hi” to anyone who passes by.  Both Amira and Matthew got promotions this year.  I wonder if the promotions are directly related to the amount of traveling they both do?  Amira and her father are in a competition about who will travel the most each year.  She always envied her father the amount of traveling he did, but now she is finding that there is a real downside, she misses Siena. \r\n",

    "Adam—the day I am writing this letter is exactly one year to the day that he returned from Afghanistan.  I cannot tell you how happy we are that he and his unit all returned safely.   I don’t think too many people accomplish as much as he has in one year after being at war.  (Does it sound like mom is proud of her son?)   He went back to school and has taken very difficult electrical engineering classes for two semesters very successfully.  Adam’s ingenuity has helped him get out of sticky situations, but this year, he helped his dad with a sticky situation.  While getting gas on the way to the airport—Nasr always is running late—he put the credit card in the gas pump, but the pump wouldn’t release his card.   He could see the tiny edge, but it was impossible to get a grip on it.  Quick thinking Adam, asked for a piece of gum (he knows mom always carries gum)  chewed it quickly, took it out, stuck it onto the  tiny portion of the protruding card and in seconds, the card was in his hand and moments later Nasr was on his way to the airport and didn’t miss his flight.  Just call him Ghoniem McGyver!   Well, the best part of the year—for mom—was Adam’s marriage to his high school sweetheart, Oanh Hoang.  Adam and Oanh have been together for over 10 years.   Adam is so lucky to have found and kept such a wonderful young lady and of course, mom thinks Oanh is pretty lucky to have stayed with Adam.  Now, you must realize that the military requires the young men to shave every day—even in the worst of conditions,  so when Adam returned, shaving was one thing he rebelled against.  By mid July, he looked a lot like Grizzly Adams—all beard and not much else.  We did convince him to shave about two weeks before the wedding.  It was a good thing that we did because when he shaved, his face looked like a slice of Neopolitan ice cream.  His forehead was dark chocolate brown,  his nose was sunburn from too much fun at his bachelor party rafting down the Kern river, and his chin was vanilla white where his skin had not seen any light under his heavy beard.  Oh, the rafting party was fun, except my nephew, John, decided to go rafting down class 4 rapids without the raft.  Thank God he got out safely! August 1, 2010 was a day of celebrations from three different cultures.   The morning started out with the Vietnamese Tea Ceremony.  Oanh, her sisters, and family were dressed in the beautiful traditional dress—the “awsai.”  Oanh also wore the traditional headpiece that only brides wear.  To add to the color of the day, Adam wore his Marine Dress Blues.  Seeing Adam in his uniform, knowing he has only been home from war for 8 months, was very emotional for both sides of the family.   This was the ceremony where there were many tears of joy, happiness and relief.  I feel blessed that my family could experience the beauty of the cultural exchange.  Oh, and the food flowed from everywhere and it was very scrumptious.  Later in the day, Oanh rode to the second ceremony in a white, horse drawn, carriage.  She was more beautiful than any Cinderella as she walked down the aisle to meet our son styling in his tuxedo to participate in the Egyptian Islamic Ceremony officiated by Adam’s “Uncle.”   Finally, the Hawaiian officiant from the good, old US of A, made it completely legal in the state of California.  Of course, the Ghoniem wedding was not complete until the Russian belly dancer, wearing a candle topped headpiece, escorted the bride and groom into the room.  Adam and Oanh danced with her and everyone danced the night away.   The day passed much too quickly for mom, but Adam and Oanh were anxious for the three week honeymoon in London, Paris and Rome to begin.  Their favorite city was Rome—I know they will return.  They are now living in Canyon County, in their newly remodeled condo.  Their address is 18183 Sundowner Way #848 Canyon Country, California.  91387.  \r\n",

    "Jasmine –my baby—at 24—is living in San Diego and attending the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).  Now I always want the best for my children, but as I recall my college apartment was old, dingy, and had the view of the neighbor’s junk-filled driveway.  Jazz’ apartment is bright, airy, well furnished, (thank you parents) and has a view of the mountains and canyons.  In this gorgeous apartment, she has a “no shoe policy” to help keep it clean.  Why is it when the kids move out they start to be mindful of their things and their surroundings? Why can’t they start when they are in high school?  I think that is how Nasr developed his stoop, bending down so often to pick up after children.   To keep her CLEAN apartment cozy, she has Mortimer her cat and has now adopted a new “child.”  Dexter is a rust-colored, fluff-ball that loves to rough and tumble.  Pretty soon we will start calling Jazz the “cat lady.”    Jazz does have interesting décor in her home.  Every window, sliding glass door, even the refrigerator, any flat surface that can be written on with a dry erase marker is covered with chemical formulas such as glycolysis.   The balcony door has the break down from the six carbon ring into three carbon molecules running from the top of the door to the bottom.  I asked her to explain her bio-chemistry to me.  She just shook her head and said a little impatiently, “Mom, I think this is too complicated for you.”    Word of advice for young parents, never let your kids know your weaknesses, because your children will remind you of them, often!  All of YOU who can do bio-chemical analyses in your head, please let me know—I suggest you have a bio-chemical conversation with Jazz. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2010 has been filled with adventure and joy.  Each time our families gets together, I thank my parents for the most precious gift they could have given me—my siblings and the laugher and happiness that we share when we are together.   My prayer is that everyone is blessed with wonderful family, unending fun and happiness, and most importantly, good health. Oh, and by the way, to finish the story, Nasr and I decided, there is no place like home and we are NOT moving to Abu Dhabi.   Have a very Happy New Year!!!\r\n"

    "Decorating the tree is always a highlight of the Holiday season and this year I got a little earlier start than usual—early as in 6:30 a.m.  Everyone knows the tree cannot be decorated unless Christmas carols are blasting in your ears.   This year, my family is very thankful to Pandora, Apple and earphones.   Why? Well, if you would have looked through the window as dawn was breaking, you would have seen a bespectacled elf dressed in grey (this elf doesn’t own anything green) dancing, arms flailing trying not to drop the ornaments.  And at the same time, lip syncing every word while reminiscing over each and every ornament, some evoking smiles and some tears.   This scene depicts our year, a little bizarre, a little dancing, some tears and lots of smiles.  \n",

    "Nasr  (Gidu) is back at work—ok, he never left work, but he is back working in at UCLA.  He inherited a larger office so he refurbished, re-floored , re-computered and redecorated.   Yes, folks, it does look beautiful.  It also continues to look like he never does any work.  The only thing on his desk is his large white computer and the magnetic perpetual motion toy that everyone loves to play with.  That is it!  I think there is something wrong when the desk is empty.  It tells me that he doesn’t have anything to do—but he claims he is super busy with new projects on electric propulsion.  According to Nasr, this what we used to think was science fiction, making space ships and rockets move through space for a very long time.  Yes, he is a rocket scientist!  Nasr can be a fun loving guy, but he has taken a new view of fun.  He told me the other day that he wanted us to sit and relax and study grammar so we could be a little more intellectually stimulated.  OMG!   How many of you are already groaning with boredom over the thought of studying grammar for fun.   Would someone please help my  rocket scientist come up with “fun” things to do?  All I can say is thank goodness he loves to travel.  With a little help from the concierge in the hotel, we cruised the South China Sea at sunset complete with fireworks and floated over the top of cruise ships and the rainforest .  The city of Singapore is an architectural dream—one everyone needs to see and experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia (Teta) continues to be very busy and her desks-both at home and at work are covered with paper, books, several computers, yesterday’s lunch, and various other items.  My desk says busy—it also says crazed and overwhelmed, but that is every administrator in the state of California.  Oh, fund is a four letter word here—no one in the state has a fund for anything and it means more work for us all.   Ok, I am off my soap box and onto my bicycle.  Bicycling is one of my favorite hobbies and this year I did manage to stay on it-no major falls.  You will see me cruising the foothills of the Santa Susanna Mountains in the northern San Fernando Valley on Rinaldi Street.  My round trip uphill trek is about 10 miles long.  I agree, ten miles is not that much, but that uphill push makes my cheeks rosy.  Not long ago I was touring up the street after finishing about 8 miles and I came to a stop sign.  I waited while this jogger who couldn’t have been older than 18 gracefully glided by me, not a drop of perspiration on her brow.  I’m sure she felt sorry for the this old lady whose face looked as crimson as the  metallic cherry red of the vehicles I like to drive, and she cheerfully rooted for me, saying “Good Job.”   Little did she know that I could feel my heartbeat pounding in my eyes and I wondered if they were bulging out with each beat.   Yet, with her encouragement I was able to keep going and made it up the last three hills (why is it uphill going home?).   Nasr is creative when it comes to my birthday  and this year was no exception.  We ate on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Casino.   Singapore is famous for its “blue sunset” and there is no better place to see it than on the 57th floor of this three towered casino with a large spaceship floating across the top.  Yes, we ate in the spaceship.  We watched the sunset move through so many shades from light blue to royal blue to navy blue to midnight blue.  The food at the restaurant was a bit pricey, (damned expensive), but it was worth it.  I told the waiter to give my compliments to the chef and suddenly he was in front of me so I could compliment him in person.  I mentioned that it was my birthday so he personally created a birthday platter for me complete with chocolate, fireworks and song!\n",

    "Amira, Matthew and Siena will soon have a new addition to their family.  The little one is due in mid-December.  No names on the horizon yet, but Teta cannot let the new baby feel left out, so I named her (temporarily) Orange Mango because her sister was temporarily called Banana Berry.   We are just a  bunch of fruits, but I think you better keep that to yourself.  Matthew was helping Amira “nest” by remodeling, repainting and rewiring the family room (it’s really Siena’s toy room) to make room for the new baby.  Thanks to both sets of Grandparents,  Siena has a well stocked toy room, complete with kitchen, playhouse and bunk beds.  Siena inherited the bunk beds that both Teta and mom played with  as children, complete with new handmade sheets and hand crocheted blankets.   When we had it set up we suggested she put her dolls in the bed, but she tossed the dolls across the room in disgust and insisted that her pink and white stuffed kitty cats were the only ones that were going to sleep in those beds.  Kitties are Siena’s passion.   You can get her anything as long as it resembles or is a kitty kat.   She needs a real kitty, but the problem is that daddy is severely allergic to them.  So, to all our doctor friends,  do you have good suggestions  to help with daddy’s allergy so Teta and Gidu can get Siena a real kitty.   Gidu has resolved that Siena will be a great mathematician.  How can he make that determination when she is only 2 ½ years old?   Siena had difficulty saying Teta, so she called me “eta”, which according to Nasr is the Greek symbol for efficiency—she doesn’t waste time by adding the “T”.   Therefore, according to his crystal ball, she will be a math genius.  Of course  with both parents being electrical engineers, his fortune telling may not be so far-fetched.\n",

    "Adam and Oanh traveled with us to Costa Rica for Nasr’s nephew’s wedding.  Costa Rica is a rainforest in the  mountains.  We rented an SUV and between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. we navigated over mountains, over narrow-not quite roads, through the jungle,  and past the roaring ocean.  Nasr drove, I stressed, Adam stressed and Oanh stayed calm—or at least that was the way it looked.  By the time we arrived at the beautiful hotel overlooking the rainforest and the Pacific Ocean we were all ready to kiss the ground.  If you ever travel to this gorgeous country, make sure you use their GPS—because it gets you where you want to be.  The deluge of rain did not spoil the beautiful wedding—but now we all know why it is called the rainforest.  Adam and Oanh are the adventurous ones.  They decided to go zip-lining through the canopy of the rainforest.  They were hanging on to tiny little ropes as they zipped over the ground hundreds of feet above it.   Yes, they came back happy, but tired.   Once they came back they had to rest.  They were amazed that mom and dad could trek on the ground of the rainforest for many hours and then go swimming.  They both decided we had more energy than they do.  I think fear wears you out more than anything.  Adam is learning four languages—no one can speak any of the languages, but we would be lost in this day and age without them.  Adam is learning all the computer languages, C, Matlab, Assembly and VHDL.  He will only be able to talk to robots with these languages, but who knows maybe we will all be talking to robots pretty soon.\n",
    "Jasmine has the luck of the Irish!  She loves to attend concerts, but Jasmine is not known for her patience to wait in line.   She planned to get in line early and she did, but so did everyone else on campus.  She waited a while and when it seemed hopeless that she would get a ticket, she gave up and left the line.  She was feeling sad and hung her head.  Boy, was she lucky she was looking down!   Not 200 feet from the line was a crisp 20 dollar  bill just lying on the sidewalk, waiting for Jazz to pick it up.   Now, she was much more creative with her money than I would have been.  She walked up to the front of the line, showed the first one in line the $20 bill and asked if she was willing to give Jazz her spot for the 2 dollar0.  She was another college student so YES!!!! She was took the money, Jazz got in line and bought her tickets and went to the concert.   For Jasmine studying biology has both its positive and negative aspects.  She finds it very interesting, challenging and worrisome.  According to Jasmine, she knows too much about bacteria and when she watches people make her lunches, she cringes and wonders if she should eat it.  Yes, she does eat it, but examines every morsel before it goes into her mouth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As we examine our year, we know we are thankful for so much—sometimes we cringe and wonder, but we enjoy and try to live life to its fullest.  We are blessed with wonderful family and friends who give us so much happiness.  As we move into 2012, we want to wish all of you a happy holiday, a merry Christmas and a healthy, prosperous new year.\n"

    "It is a cold, rainy day in Southern California--ooh shiver!  The December temperature is a chilly 63 degrees and will drop to a super low of 54!  But there is hope, it should stop raining and warm up to a reasonable 77 degrees by Thursday.  With luck we may survive the cold snap.   So as I write my yearly note, the Christmas carols, the warm blanket and my hot chocolate will help me muddle through the frigid temperatures.\n",

    "Nasr (aka Gidu) loves the beach and loves to bicycle.   For the longest time I thought Nasr loved to bicycle at the beach because of  the pounding surf, the fragrant, salty air, the huge expanse of the shimmering water going beyond the horizon to his far away memories of swimming and cavorting in the Mediterranean Sea.  Yet, I recently discovered otherwise. In case some of you are not aware, Beach Volleyball is a major part of the California beach scene.   As you glide past the players on your bike, you see their skills and great form in executing a cut shot.   Nasr, however, could not say much about a cut shot, but he does admire those bikini-clad forms.   Someone needs to tell Nasr he needs to keep his eyes on the road.  He has way too many close calls next to the nets.   Last winter when we were in Falls Church, Gidu and I had several opportunities to take Siena to the park.  Whenever Nasr leaves the house, he takes his iPad.  He makes sure he brings it just like I make sure I bring my purse.  So, at the park, Siena was swinging and she was watching her Gidu sitting on the bench working on his computer.  Siena looked at me shook her head and said, ÒWhat are we going to do with Gidu?\"   Before I could respond, she shouted, \"Wake up, Gidu.  You need to play.\"   He did wake up and started using the new Siri application on his iPad and iPhone. He is so happy that the application talks back to him. Nasr tells us it is great to talk to her, but he spends more time talking to her than he does the rest of us.  There can be three people in the room and he is still talking to Siri.  Should I be jealous?  He took Siri and travelled to Singapore again this year.  He, of course, enjoyed the collegial repartee that he has with other engineers and scientists, but his upgrade to the Presidential Suite in the hotel was the highlight of his trip.  Speaking of presidential, Nasr flew to New York with several of his friends to meet the current (as of December 1st) leader of Egypt, President Mohamed Morsi. However, before the visit, he had the chance to walk the very crowded streets of Manhattan. People speaking in every language of the world, busily heading to where they needed to be hurried past Nasr in all directions.  Luckily, he found the food trucks that sold Egyptian sandwiches.  He was amazed at the popularity of the food and flabbergasted by how much money the owners were making because the lines of hungry diners snaked for several blocks. Meeting the President of Egypt sounds super spectacular, but there were about 499 other people vying for the President's attention by shouting, arguing and praying.  Nasr sat back and watched the circus.  He decided he would leave politics to the politicians.\n",

    "Virginia (aka Teta) packed for her summer trip.  I packed two suitcases filled with all the necessary items I would need for this year's adventure.  Then I carried the 15 feet down the hallway to the blue room. I unpacked and then waited anxiously for Amira and Matthew to come for Nasr's niece, Nina's wedding. As the family is growing, we figured it made more sense to put Amira and Matthew and the two girls in our bedroom--more room for all of them.  Even though I didn't travel very far, the summer was spectacular.  It was filled with family and friends and joy and laughter.  (We would have traveled, but the school year ended late and started early--so we couldn't take our usual trip.  (Don't worry, we are traveling to the Bahamas in December--think blue skies and warm weather.) Oh, the wedding was the highlight of the summer.  Elegant designer gowns, seeing family and friends, new and old, and a spectacular venue--all made a fun evening for all.  Summer didnÕt end when I went back to work, so Nasr and I enjoyed the country club scene in the evenings and weekends.  We swam, worked out in the gym, and caroused at the Friday night dances.  The songs were familiar and just as it was when I was growing up; there were more women than men dancing. And just like then  the range of men's dancing ability went from the very adept swing dancers to the making a fool of yourself dancers.  They all were acting 21 or younger, but they were all members of the geriatric generation. The last song was the Achy Breaky Heart.  I knew that the next morning, the majority of dancers would be singing and humming the same tune, but the words would be Achy Breaky knees, hips and muscles, not hearts. I had the chance to play a part in a play this summer.  The play was an immigrant story and the immigrants happened to be Egyptian.  The role I played was such a stretch, that you need to be impressed.  I played the role of the American married to an Egyptian professor from UCLA.   My siblings have called me a drama queen for a long time.  Do you wonder where Jazz gets her drama from?  I worked with a professional director, professional actors and many volunteer actors like myself.  We had a great time.  I learned so much about acting, the theatre and myself, in particular that I still have the ability to memorize the monologue that the writer so aptly and beautifully wrote. Now, retirement looks even better since the acting bug bit. (Don't look for me in the local theatres, yet!) Nasr loves technology and I love my cars--I don't have a clue how they run, but I love the way they look and feel.  Nasr gave me an early Christmas gift--a Mercedes E-350 luxury vehicle. Oh, it is like riding in a bubble. When you see me floating gracefully down the highway, don't bust my bubble.\n",

    "Amira and Matthew brought a new life into the world at the end of the last year.  Jada Alexandra Koerner was born on December 19, 2011.  Teta got the chance to spend time with her during her first three weeks of life.   Teta very happily took the late night shift to give them a little break.  It is a good thing that LA is three hours earlier.  3 a.m. is only midnight for Teta, but way too early for Mommy and Daddy to get up.  At the time, Siena, our little three year old queen, was not thrilled with her little sister.  Since the baby arrived just a day after Teta came in, Siena assumed Teta had brought Jada into the house.  Siena's issue was that Jada was taking Mom's time away from Siena.  Those three weeks passed too quickly and soon the family was running smoothly on their own.  Siena loves cats (we tried all the remedies that you sent last year, thank you, but--they don't work) and since she can't have a real kitty, she wears them on her clothes.  Thank goodness for the Hello Kitty fashion line.  In early April, Siena donned her bright pink rain boots just before crawling into bed.  Amira tried to convince her that boots were not bedtime attire; Siena was not convinced.   As a good mother, Amira picks her battles and let Siena sleep with her boots on.  A short time later when Amira checked on Siena, she was sleeping on the heavy boots.  Siena is as much into fashion as her Aunt Jazzy.  Years ago, when Jazz was two, I predicted she would be a clothes fashionista.  Will Siena love clothes and fashion as much as her aunt?   My children promised they would pass on the information to you if Siena takes after Jazz. Anyone taking bets on this?  They stayed for a week, but it went by much too quickly.   Gidu and I dropped them off at the airport.  While I was holding Jada, I tearfully said good-bye to Siena and hugged her.  Siena, looking relieved, said \"Good Bye, Jada.\"    Needless to say, Siena was utterly disappointed when I gave Jada to Dad and kissed her good bye, too.  Jada had the chance to shine at the onset of her 11th month. She took her first real steps on Thanksgiving Day!   Amira and Matthew ran a 10-mile marathon in the fall. This will keep up their stamina. They will need it for when the girls are teenagers!\n",

Now, it was a surprise for us, but they planned for a child to be born in the year of the Snake.   Adam is the year of the Dog, and Oanh is the year of the Rooster.  A child born in the year of the Snake will be the most compatible with them.  This is not a new art, just one that is new to me.  In a few moments of weakness--ok, in moments of utter frustration, I wonder if I should have planned to have children who are compatible with me.  But, then I realize that life would not have been so fulfilling and I would not have developed such a wealth of patience.  When I pried Adam for a hint about a name, he looked at me pitifully and said, \"Mom, don't even ask. You won't know until the baby was born.\"  I know I can wait because of that patience that I learned so well.  Thanks to Adam and Oanh Nasr and I have participated in three 5k runs.  Ok, they are runs, but we walked.  Our first run was the Year of the Dragon Chinatown 5K run.  Since we had never walked around the area of Dodger Stadium, we sauntered through the streets stopping to take pictures and stopping to take in the panorama views of the Los Angeles.  What should have take a 45 minutes tops, took us a good hour and 15 minutes. As you have already figured out, we didn't win the race!.  But not being quitters, we tried our second 5K in Fullerton. The amount of food that you eat at the end of the runs negates any positive effect that the run gives you weight-wise.  But, the Superwoman, Superman feeling lasts a few days--just stay away from the scale.  The final run was in Long Beach at the Aquarium of the Pacific.    Nasr's sister, Susu, walked her first 5K.    Now that Oanh is very pregnant we are taking a little  \"K\" hiatus, but never fear, we will keep moving along.  10K next year???  Yeah, right!!  Adam is into antiques.  He acquired a 1911 Underwood typewriter.  Now, for him it is so unique with the ribbon and seeing the keys move. For us, it is just a little older version of what we learned to type on.  He wonders about the people who used the antiques. What were their lives like?  What were their dreams and did they accomplish them?  I can guarantee that no one will look at the 2011 Lenovo laptop on which I am composing this letter and wonder anything about it. Most likely it will be reassembled into an electronic robot for his grandkids.  Unless, Snakey (temporary name) will love computer parts, she will not get the same pleasure as Adam from her antiques.\n",

    "Jasmine graduated from the University of California, San Diego in June in Human biology.  YEAH!!!!!!!!!! (How many exclamation points can I type to let you know how happy we are?)  Even though she graduated, she still had three lower division physics classes to take.  This summer she took two classes at UCLA and then the last she is finishing now. I hear a lot about velocity, magnetic field and torque.  Jasmine mentioned to her dad a stapler uses torque.  Maybe some of these principles she is learning she will be able to apply.  Every day he and Jazz lunch at the Faculty Center and they come home every evening describing the lovely three course lunch that they had which usually includes lamb, fish or steak. I compare my yogurt and apple lunch and think there is something wrong with this picture.   Jasmine is interning at the University of Irvine in Urology.   She is learning so much and tells us about the exciting research that is happening there. She is learning how to suture, consenting patients to studies, and observing surgeries. The most exciting gadget is the many-armed DaVinci robot that surgeons are learning to use.  In the future the doctor will not be standing over the patient. She will be sitting off to the side and the robot will be cutting, clamping and stitching as the doctor manipulates it remotely.  Science Fiction or Reality?  Will her Uncle's scalpel become an antique like the typewriter?  Better tell his children to hang onto one or two for posterity. Jasmine has been very generous to her mother this year.  I have been the lucky recipient of her hand-me-downs.  Close your mouths!  She is not giving me her clothes.  That would be both Science Fiction and ridiculous.  But, her two beautiful Chanel fragrances that she considers too old for her, are perfect scents for me.  Luckily, there is one size we do share in common--our feet size.  So, the brand name boots and shoes that no longer fit in her closet have come to me.  Now, Nasr has long complained about the number of shoes in my closet.  Jasmine's shoe closet FAR exceeds mine.  Particularly in the cost department!   She better get a good paying job to support this habit of hers.  Mom will not always able to buy these beautiful items.  But I must say, I do enjoy the hand-me-downs.  I wonder what they will look like when she buys them?  I can hardly wait!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many things for which we all can hardly wait, but I hope everyone takes some time to  sit back and  enjoy the wonders of the season and takes pleasure in  the happiness of families and friends. I pray the New Year brings good health and continued happiness for you and yours.  Celebrate each moment, because once it is played, we can't rewind and get it back.   Happy New Year!!!\n"

    "Life is a beach!  Well, at least this year it started out that way.  We brought in the 2013 New Year on a warm Bahamas’ beach under the stars and fireworks and have been riding the waves and looking at stars all year long.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr is at the magical age where he now earns social security.  In order to fight the wages of age, we continue to bike at the beach and hike in the mountains.  One bright Sunday morning, Nasr donned his Indiana Jones hat ready to face whatever adventure we would encounter hiking in the canyon behind us.  Just minutes into the hike we heard loud clanging and a roar of shouting voices.   We bravely (think Indiana Jones) proceeded to follow the bend in the trail and chanced upon 30 to 40 characters in a medieval English sword fight.  Isn't this modern day California?  Or does being in  \n",
    "California explain the unusual events of the day? We were detained while they filmed and fought. Once the roaring and clanging ended, we were allowed to move on.  Seconds later, they were at it again.  The problem was that Nasr wore the wrong hat--next time he will have to wear his helmet from his suit of armor while hiking.  Nasr traveled to China and strolled the streets of Beijing with an old friend for about 4 hours.  With each step he took, his lungs filled with the filth of pollution.  He would have loved to stay out longer, but he felt he couldn't breathe.  He was amazed that he walked 4 hours.   I am not sure if it was the pollution or the heavy political conversations that he had with his friend that affected his breathing.  All summer long Nasr was flanked by two, tall, dark, handsome, bodyguards--or at least that was the way it looked.   He worked with Adam and his nephew, Mohamed, designing new materials. Who knows maybe that new computer you are surfing on will contain one of their new materials.  But, Nasr's greatest accomplishment and lifelong dream occurred on April 27, 2013.  He rode his bike hands free!  To my horror, this senior citizen chose to perfect this skill while surrounded by 30 other cyclists all trying to navigate the sharp curves of the Venice Beach bike path.  He now continues to ride no-handed at the worst times.  Would someone please tell him just because he can do it, doesn't mean he should do it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia, still younger than Nasr, hasn't had the time to do as much writing as she wished she could.  Amira and Nasr think it is easy to become the next JK Rowling and were busy throwing out ideas for books.  They think they have the perfect formula.  I will give it a try and see if it happens.  If you see a book written by V.G. Raider--it's me.  Nasr says Ghoniem is the description of the people who raided the caravans of the desert.   I have a plethora of ideas, but I need to find the time to write, first.  If anyone has figured out how to add a few more hours to the day, please let me know.  Nasr and I have been trying to keep ourselves healthy.  The five a.m. trip to the gym is usually cold and always dark.  But there is a reward for the lack of sleep and physical exercise.  As we descend the steps of the club, the turquoise and coral sunrise of the new day is a symphony for our eyes.  It is our reward for working out.  As I ooh and aaah over the beauty of the sky, and Nasr is confused about what I am talking about.  He tells me I am being much too poetic, but I think he needs to stop looking at his feet and look at the sky--I hope he is not looking down when he is riding no handed--or he will be see stars instead of the bright colors.   We have had a chance to see quite a few movies this year, do not ask me to remember their names, but I have enjoyed them.  Nasr loves dinner and a movie.  Will someone please explain to Nasr that dinner and a movie is not a cold homemade turkey sandwich and a banana.  I have felt empowered this year because on the second day of the year I faced a fear--literally.  In the warm, deep, teal waters of the Caribbean I swam with brightly colored fish of all shapes and sizes and with huge, brown, reef sharks.   No, there was no cage--just water, flippers, my snorkel and the sharks.  No, I didn't stay in the water very long.  I jumped in before Nasr did and got out before he did.  Sometimes we have to face our fears and it feels good to come out unscathed.  Well, I was out of the water unscathed, but my kids nearly ripped me apart for taking such a chance.  Will I do it again this year?  Hell no!\n",

    "Amira, Matthew, Siena and Jada:  Jada will turn two about the time you read this letter.  Amira and Matthew are finding out that children do not have to wait for their birthday before a child transitions into the terrible two phase.  Amira is sad because up until a few weeks ago, Jada was a calm, easy, baby.   Jada is speaking, but quite often Amira has to turn to Siena to have her translate.  Siena understands Jada’s language, but most of us have to guess and quite often it is wrong.  If anyone has any ideas on preventing a child from entering the \"terrible\" stage, please let me know.  Jada and Siena both love books.  Teta--yes that’s me, keeps a constant supply of books flowing to the house.  Matthew realized I am not going to send shelves to hold them, so he is painting and remodeling the basement to make more space for the books. It is either that or buy a new house just for the books.  Siena is four and is in pre-school! She has an idea and opinion about it all.  On top of her scholarly pursuits, she is turning into a prima ballerina who can gallop through the house like one of her colorful little ponies and is only truly happy when she is dancing to the Disney princess songs. If she could, she would be Princess Rapunzel and grow long flowing hair like her mommy.    Amira's weekend is filled with ballet, music class, shopping and running marathons.  Most moms just run errands.\n",

    "Adam, Oanh and Olivia.  Yes, Olivia Violet Ghoniem was born on February 9, 2013.  She was supposed to be born in the year of the snake.  She was born 11 hours too early, so she is Dragon.  This tells me that Olivia is going to do what Olivia wants to do.  Her parents may have plans for her, but she has her own way planned.  Look out, Mom and Dad!  Olivia, or Ollie, as she is called by her parents, is the light of her dad's eyes.  This tough Marine fearlessly changes the fiercest and most pungent of diapers.  He carries her with one hand like a sack of potatoes and at other times he proudly carries her on his chest so she can watch the world around her and flirt with anyone and everyone who walks by her.  She has an infectious smile that no one can resist--particularly her Gidu (Nasr).  She has a tiny little finger but she has these two Ghoniem men wrapped around it.  Oanh will be the photographic historian for the little one.  I wish we could have shared instantaneous pictures of our kids with our parents.  Oanh sends pictures of Olivia going through her daily routine and even though we don't see her everyday, we practically see a picture every day.  Gidu and Teta have the opportunity to babysit on Sundays.  She loves the outdoors; she especially likes swinging on the bench swing and staring into bright blue sky.  Mark my words; this little girl is going to be astronaut or an astronomer.   She is always looking up.  She has learned the useful skill of pointing.  She now points to everything and anything expecting that these tall people around her will give her the name of what she is pointing to.  We take long walks and I cannot tell you how many times I have said tree in the last month.  Olivia, like her father, loves chips (hers are baby chips) of all kinds for a snack.  We have decided that this is passed on through the genes.  Nasr's signature brows have been passed onto a second grandchild.  When Olivia, just like Siena, is puzzled or upset, she can furrow her brows just like Gidu.  No one has to guess what any one of them is thinking.\n",

    "Jasmine is studying for her masters in Public Health at George Washington University in Washington D. C.  Now, what did I do wrong that both of my girls are on the far side of the U.S.?  Did you feel earthquake here in LA at the end of September?  Well, that was because all our kids were in D.C.  Adam and Oanh took Olivia to visit Amira and Jazz.  It’s obvious to me that the earth couldn't take the stress of having too many Ghoniem children away from their parents.  Jasmine's 8th floor apartment faces the State Department, is a block away from the Kennedy Center, then to the left and a few blocks away is the Washington Monument, the White House and the Capitol.  Jasmine has discovered city life and loves it.  The Metro station, Foggy Bottom, is just a few blocks from her house and that gives her access to almost anywhere she wants to go.  Jasmine is having a bit of a problem adjusting to the cold.  She still tries to dress like she did in California, light clothes and no coat.  She is quickly finding that the D.C. cold is quite different from the LA cold. The city has new creatures to keep her company.  While walking home one night she heard the tweeting of birds.  No, it wasn't the tweeting of birds, but the squeaking of rats.   In LA she would have run screaming.  She tells me that she kept walking.  I find that hard to believe, but she said she couldn’t run and scream because everyone would laugh at her.  I am forced to believe because; if I can swim with sharks she can walk with rats.  The best part of Jasmine being in D.C. is that she and Amira get to spend time together and the girls get to know their cool Aunt Jazzy.  Siena is Jasmine's shadow whenever she visits.  Jasmine does fun makeup, plays loud music and teaches her how to show real attitude, with a no, no, no response. Siena picked it up and perfected it in seconds.  Amira cringed.  Matt shook his head and Jada took it all in stride.  Aunt Jazzy is fun!  Believe it or not, Jasmine does study there, but I think her hours are more like those of the creatures of the night.  As Jazz was demonstrating the no, no, no attitude with her hands, Nasr looked at them and asked if she bleached her hands.  No, she doesn't bleach her hands; she just doesn't see enough daylight to get any color on her skin.  Of course, she just could look just like her mother, minus the attitude.  \n",

    "As I said, the year started under the stars and the year is ending on a star.  As we prepare for Act III of our lives, we bought our retirement home on Golden Star Lane in Carlsbad.  We have a couple of years before we get to use it full time, but it also gives us two years to get ready for fun in the sun.\n",

    "Nasr has returned to the nomadic ways of his ancestors, the Awlaad Ali tribe.  We travel from the scorching, valley, desert to the cool, refreshing, coast twice or thrice a month.  And as nomads we found the therapeutic artisan wells of Carlsbad.  They are highly alkaline and great for the body and all sorts of ailments—it is the water of Eden—or so the advertisements say.  Yes, we found them, but I haven’t convinced Nasr that I need to partake of the water therapy, yet.  According to Nasr, there are other forms of therapy I need more.  However, if any of my family want to buy me a massage and some water, I will force myself to check it out.  When I’m rejuvenated, I will let you know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr--way into senior citizenship—earned his fourth fellowship this year when he became a Fellow of the Materials Research Society.  This is truly an honor as there are tens of thousands of members of this community.  Not that I am saying I am proud of my husband, but very few people have the breadth of knowledge to be members of societies in four different fields and at the same time the depth to earn the fellowship in that community.  Also, this year he has created new materials that rejuvenate themselves and applied for a couple of patents along the way.  Nasr has re-discovered the sea.  Ok, this is not the Mediterranean and the Pacific Ocean is a little colder, but he and Adam love to go boogie boarding and fight the waves.   He told Adam that he hadn’t had that much fun since he was a kid.  Adam believed him because his face was beaming with happiness.  Gidu (Grandpa) is the granddaughter whisperer.  No matter their mood, the minute they see Gidu they run and laugh for joy.  It might be that they have him wrapped around their little fingers and he will do anything for them, or he just may have special granddaughter power.  As most of you know, Nasr loves to clean. I might say he is a little obsessive about it—just ask his kids.   On one of our jaunts to Carlsbad, Nasr was busily cleaning the pool because the wind had picked up and put a little debris in the water.  When the loud thunder clambered down the golf course,  Nasr was using the long, metal pole to meticulously skim the water  His son, the electrical engineer, quickly got the pole out of the water and reminded him that there are times to clean the pool and times not to clean it.  During a thunder storm is one of those times.  He may be a rocket scientist, but he sometimes lacks a little common sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia—not as old as Nasr, and I can’t count that high anymore—enjoyed a much overdue family reunion in Wisconsin this July. I am blessed with a great family, but NEVER invite them to your birthday party.  Oooohh, I think they scoured every card shop to find the nastiest and funniest birthday cards and raunchiest gifts that they could find.  If you want to laugh long, hard, belly laughs come to any Schink event and you will leave smiling and laughing all the way home. While in Wisconsin, we decided to visit our old Alma Mater-University of Wisconsin-Madison.  You know the old adage, you can never go back—it is so true when it comes to your college days.  I now know exactly how Rip Van Winkle felt.  He only slept for 20 years, I was away for over forty-something years--no counting folks—and I felt as if I landed in a foreign land.  State street is Yuppie—no more hippies and way too clean!  At least, I found that the German themed beer hall in the student union had stayed the same—I think the “beer hall” will never leave.  According to students during my time, beer is the best study drink.  Do you think that has changed? We think that what we left behind will stand still as we move on.  Guess what?  It moves on and you can’t go back!  We still love to bike, but with the nomadic lifestyle it has been hard to get biking.  And besides that, Nasr does not want to put bikes on the two new cars and scratch them up.  So..we have been walking.  We walk on the beach, we walk next to the lagoon, we walk above the beach, we walk and walk and walk.  I have a pedometer and use it to keep track of my required 10,000 steps a day.  It is very easy to reach that number of steps while we are in Carlsbad.  It is definitely more of a struggle in Granada Hills.\n",

    "Amira, Matthew, Siena and Jada.  Siena is already in kindergarten and Jada is turning three.  We started the New Year with this wonderful little family in the “Bahamaths”, as Siena and Jada lovingly call these islands. They celebrated New Year’s Day at the Junkanoo parade.  The colors of the outrageous and unbelievably huge feathery costumes that the Bahamians wore were a feast for the eyes—particularly at Siena and Jada’s eye level.  They also saw a sea captain lift a shark out of the water and kiss it.  Of course, this was after the girls fed the sharks some dog food.  Jada, at two, was fascinated with the Jada-sized chess pieces on the outdoor chess board.  She skillfully lugged the pieces from one corner to the next trying to come up with the best strategies to win.  Her dad better watch out if she is a strategist at two, what will she be like at 16?  As most mothers, Amira does not want to see her children grow up.  After repeating that sentiment several times to her daughters, Siena started to worry as she approached her 5th birthday.  In a worried voice, Siena told her mother that Jada could have her birthday, but Siena still wanted the party. Amira quickly edited her comments to say, that Siena could turn 5, but not six.  Any bets on how Siena is going to deal with it next year?  It is amazing the kind of information that kids retain when you don’t realize it.  Jada is listening and learning about the world.  After hearing that their favorite cartoon character is from South America, Siena wanted to know where South America was located.  Two year old Jada kept repeating “Ball, ball, ball.”  Amira didn’t know what she wanted.  So, tired of waiting for her mother to understand, Jada scurried into their playhouse and pulled out a small globe so mom could show Siena the whereabouts of South America.  Is Jada prepping to be a world traveler?   Amira tries to steer her girls away from make-up, but when Teta (Grandma) is around, they have found a sure fire way of wearing lipstick.  Just kiss Teta on the lips and they can sport bright cherry red lipstick.  You probably have figured it out that Teta encourages it so she can get as many kisses as possible.  The only problem—white dresses and red lipstick—sorry Mom!  Amira and Matthew were window shopping one day and spotted a Maserati on display.  After a few calculations, they realized they could either lease FOUR Maserati cars a year, or pay for the cost of childcare.  What would you do?\n",

    "Adam, Oanh, and Olivia. Our red-headed Olivia is lucky because she gets to spend more time with Gidu.  Whenever Gidu is around, ALL the rest of us are chopped liver.  Adam and Oanh decided to teach Olivia sign language.  I admit, I rolled my eyes and said, oh these young and foolish parents.  Error!  Error!  I was wrong.  I was very wrong.  This little girl could communicate her needs and wants to her parents and grandparents and wow—so much less crying—both parents and baby. When she wanted her beloved toy cat, she signed cat.  If she needs milk, or her diapers changed or water or food, she signed it.  Now, she is talking up a storm and uses sign language when we have a hard time understanding her.  Luckily, Gidu and I get a chance to spend more time with her, so on an excursion to the mall we were window shopping.  Olivia loves shoes so she was on a mission to find the best shoes and of course she spies the Michael Kors store.  She quickly scurries into the store, takes a hurried glance around the store and then flits out the door in seconds.  She caught the attention of the sales clerk who smiled and murmured good bye as Olivia rushed out.  Olivia, not wanting to be rude, twirled around and went back inside and waved goodbye.  Then she grabbed my hand because she had places to go and people to see.  Adam, Oanh, and Ollie go for bike rides, too.    Well, Olivia rides in the Ollie Trolley for 7 or 8 miles while Adam pulls her behind him.  Oanh and Adam are both very busy with work.  Adam has opened up a new office in a Westwood high-rise for DMS.  His view is pretty spectacular.  While Adam was on a trip, I helped Oanh with Olivia because nurses have to be at work very early—before child care opens up.  Now,  I can really feel for young mothers.  When you have to  get yourself up, dressed and fed, and then get the child up, dressed and fed, and then take the child to childcare BEFORE you are able to get to work, is HARD WORK!!!\n",

    "Jasmine is living in Washington D.C. completing her final year of graduate school.  (Yippee-mom and dad will soon have some expendable income, again.)  Studying Public Health is very different from  all her biology work at San Diego.  She called her dad and told him that she missed calculus and physics.  I think she just missed the time she spent going over problems with her dad.  Jazz moved into a new apartment this year.  When Nasr and I were in graduate school, we did not have a gym in the building, conference rooms, special guest rooms or a concierge in our apartment building.  We were born 40 years too early!   Jasmine has the traveling bug in her this year.  I think she is trying to visit every state before she graduates or at least before she has to foot the bills for it.  She has traveled to Chicago, Sioux Falls, North Dakota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Michigan, and California.  Yes, she is full time student!  On one of Jasmine’s excursions to California, she and I went hiking in the Santa Susana mountains behind our home in Granada Hills—literally the hills behind us. Jazzy hikes very fast, at least according to Mom who was huffing and puffing up the steep, two mile climb.  Are you impressed yet? (Ok, Jazzy had to slow down a bit for mom occasionally, but I made it to the top.)  Along the way, we saw a deer and a coyote that was the size of a wolf—Jazzy insists it was a coyote—all I know is that it was a good thing neither of us was wearing our red riding hoods.  Then on the trail we came across the most alien looking bug I have ever seen in my life.  It was two inches long with a huge, bald, head with bulging eyes, and a pink slimy body covered in prison stripes.  I know people think Californians are all strange aliens—maybe this is how all Californians start out. Jazzy kept bouncing along down the hill and luckily I had my dad’s cane as a walking stick.  It saved me from a sprained ankle.  The next day Jazz was up to climbing the mountain, again.  I passed, but 30 years ago I would have beat her to the top.  We continued our trekking in D.C.  In one day, Jazz and I walked 10 miles.  Maybe we should prepare for a half marathon.\n",

    "2015 has been a year of new beginnings and endings.  We moved to the new house in Carlsbad and ended a long stay in Los Angeles when we sold our home in Granada Hills.  Our new address is 7314 Golden Star Lane, Carlsbad, CA 92011.\n",

    "Nasr loves being so close to the sea, so we take long walks along the rustic Batiquitos Lagoon and on the lively Carlsbad Strand overlooking breaking waves and sun-bleached sand.  Yes, it is as relaxing as it sounds. He also gets lots of exercise by going to the gym almost every day.  If you haven’t seen him lately, he has trimmed down to an even more handsome man. (I might have a bit of a bias on that.) This may sound like a quiet idyllic life, but Nasr still needs to commute to UCLA.  Now, this is where it gets a little hairy.  Yes, there is a train that leaves Carlsbad and gets to Union Station in Los Angeles in about two hours.  The train is comfortable, he can sit and work and make use of the time.  The issue is getting from Union Station to UCLA.  That takes one and half to two hours, also.  So, quite often the round trip commute on one day is between seven and eight hours.  How many of you have a seven to eight hour commute?  More often than not, he stays in a hotel within walking distance from his office a couple of nights a week and works on his research from home the other days.  This way he can still teach his classes in in person and conduct his research using the modern wonders of internet communications.  Now he gets to enjoy the best of two worlds!   However, he is always looking for a better solution.  If anyone has a helicopter and they would like to give Nasr a ride, there is a helicopter landing port on the top of the medical building at UCLA. Oh, I forgot to mention, that at age 67, Nasr had a brand new experience. He ate Cracker Jacks for the first time in his life and discovered they were quite tasty.   Unfortunately, there was no prize in the box.  Let’s hope he didn’t eat it.  \n",

    "Virginia’s new beginning and ending was her retirement.  Why do we have to wait so long to retire?  This is a well-kept secret that retirees try to keep from their working friends.   I am enjoying doing everything and nothing.  My problem is that I do not accomplish one quarter of what I did when I worked.  I get up early and am busy all day, but very little of what I planned to do gets done—and I don’t even watch TV.  I do miss the children.  I do miss my friends.  I do NOT miss the politics and pressure.  My first day of retirement was in Hawaii.  Sun, fun and relaxation in a 5-Star resort—not a bad beginning of retirement.  A few weeks later, we were in Auckland, New Zealand.   If you have not visited New Zealand, you must put this on your bucket list.  We were there during their winter, yet is was green and luscious, but a bit wet.  Once outside the city, every turn you make gives you an even more spectacular view of mountains, verdant hills and unusual outcroppings popping up from the ground like giant earth-green pimples.  You must visit the glow worm caves where there is no light, but the light from the glow worms sparkling like a million stars in the pitch black cave.  A couple of months later, we visited Aachen, Germany.  I am so glad Nasr is working and has these conferences to attend.  He keeps repeating, “I don’t want to retire, I don’t want to retire!” That is fine with me.  I get to travel and if I had to live with someone who is unhappily retired, that would send me scurrying back to work—or at least out the door.  Aachen is an ancient city with lots of history and a cold, stone, throne.  Charlemagne sat on this throne in Aachen.   I think we Hollywood-ize the life of kings and queens, because his throne would have been so uncomfortable and cold in the winter.  Nasr was working, but we had a chance to visit the point where the three countries of Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands share the same border.  You can visit three countries in three seconds.  That was on Nasr’s bucket list—now he can check it off. We also had a spectacular, gourmet meal in a huge cave in The Netherlands.  (This is the year of the cave—does that have any significance?)  I am writing now.  I mean writing more than just my yearly letter.  I have gone back to writing my children’s books and getting them critiqued.  Also, I created a webpage.  Yes—I DID IT!  For many of you, that is not a huge accomplishment, but for old, computer-challenged, people, it is a big deal.  The website is my forum for my blog, Life’s Chapter.  Please visit my site at lifeschapter.com/  Blog is short for weblog on a website.  I thought once I retired I was going to sit on my laurels and reminiscence about what I know, not learn so many new things.  Who would have thought?\n",

    "Amira, Matt, Siena and Jada are booked!  Their calendar is filled with fun events for the girls and their community.  I believe they had 6 Halloween parties to attend, special school events and playdates.  Amira and Matt go along for the ride—as most parents of 4 and 6 year olds do.  Time for tea!  The girls and I have begun a new tradition.  When I visit, we must have our tea party.  Of course, you must dress up for the party and you absolutely MUST wear your best hat.  I gave the girls a set of ladybug—real size—tea cups.  At this point their tea tastes more like chocolate milk, but at some point we may introduce a little tea into it.  No tea party is complete without homemade cupcakes and cupcake shaped sandwiches.  We have to read our favorite books and dance to the latest and loudest music.  Oh, don’t forget, our little pinky must be held up and away from the cup.  Jada has this mastered.   Siena has decided she is going to work for Gidu.  She has plans to be an engineer in his company.  Gidu already has created her job description.  She will write proposals, interface with clients and do some troubleshooting.  I think she has to learn a lot of vocabulary just so she can read her job description.  I was bowled over when Amira told me she went bowling this year.  Her lanes of choice were the ones in the White House!  Yes, you know, where the President lives. The area is called the Harry S. Truman Bowling Alley.   The décor is 60’s orange.  There are photos of past and current presidents bowling. Amira said she didn’t bowl all that well.  According to her one of the lanes is kind of wobbly.  I haven’t figured out if that is her excuse or not.  All this is through work.  Does anyone else want Amira’s job?\n",

    "Adam, Oanh and Olivia are welcoming a new member to their family this year.  I want to introduce Gemma.   I am a little late with my letter because I wanted to include her in the letter.   Adam and Olivia spend a lot of time together.  He loves being a dad.  There are times when his Marine manners (not public manners) come to the forefront.  Olivia is trying to mimic her dad’s burps by growling.  The other children in the park, get a little concerned.  She also knows her dad is a softie and that Mommy tries very hard to feed her healthy foods and snacks.  The whole family will be sitting in the living room and Olivia will get up, take her dad by the hand and lead him into the kitchen.  She points to the cupboard that has the chocolate.  She knows she can’t ask in front of mom, so she sneaks dad into the kitchen and it works!  She also sits on Gidu’s lap and whispers sweet nothings in his ear—chocolate, Gidu, chocolate.  They say she inherited her love of chocolate from Teta.  What can I say, if it is in the genes, there’s not much I can do.  When I am lucky enough to get to LA and can pick Olivia up from school, we have Cupcake Dates.  There is a lovely bakery not far from her school and we pick out the prettiest and chocolatiest cupcakes and savor them while we talk about her day and her friends.  (I think my granddaughters have a thing for cupcakes.  Or is it me?)  As Gidu was carrying Olivia, she stroked his mustache and said, “I like your mustache, Gidu.”  That made his day.  According to Gidu, only two girls have said they liked his mustache—and they said it 40 years apart.  (Do you think he was referring to me?)\n",

    "Jasmine has embarked on a new beginning.  She completed her Master’s in Public Health from George Washington University in August.   Then she flew as fast as she could to “Cali” as she refers to it.  A graduate deserves a graduation gift.  Jasmine’s gift was a new BMW 328i with a Pearl finish.  It is so perrrrtttyy.  Before the drought the BMW dealer offered free car washes every week.  She was very accustomed to having a beautiful clean car, but when that program ended, she had to find another alternative.  She told her dad that she found a good deal.  A car wash for only 60 dollars!  Once Nasr recovered from the sticker shock, it took a while, he convinced Jasmine that she could wash her own car for NOTHING—as we pay for the water and the soap.  So, now we have car washing days.  We line up the three cars, then all three are vacuumed, washed and polished. The best part is now Jasmine has 60 dollars more dollars in her pocket, and Nasr has a smile on his face.  Next step is to find a job. It is almost a Catch 22.  You need experience for a job, but if companies don’t hire people without experience, how do you get a job?  She spends long hours filling out applications, resumes, and cover letters.  But the early morning—correction—the morning is for her.  She gets in her beautiful automobile, grabs a cup of her favorite Starbucks coffee and drives along the coast for hours enjoying the sun, the waves and the air flowing through her hair as she contemplates her next moves.  California is the place she wants to be.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So much has happened and we are happy with our new beginnings and look fondly upon all that ended.   We wish the New Year will be filled with new beginnings and new experiences for our family and friends.  But most importantly, may your year be filled with happiness and good health!\n"

    "The Ghoniems have been on the go this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr couldn't afford a honeymoon in 1976 so this year, our 40th Anniversary, we spent almost the entire year enjoying a honeymoon punctu1ted with short breaks in Carlsbad taking long walks on the beach, contemplating the red and gold sunsets and frolicking in the pool. We welcomed the New Year on the Big Island of Hawaii. We flew thousands of feet over the island in a helicopter getting a bird's eye view of the red and black roiling earth of the Kilauea volcano, majestic waterfalls, 2000 foot cliffs, and the lush verdant canyons of Hilo. But that wasn't the height of our trip. Our most astonishing adventure was the tour to the top of Mauna Kea, 13, 796 feet above sea level. Yes, the frigid, biting, air, as thin as a shadow of hair, doled out a hefty dose of altitude sickness, but it was more than worth the headache. Stargazing is an incredible experience as the number of stars up there is comparable to the number of drops in the sea. A month or so later, Nasr had a conference at the Schontal Abbey in southwestern Germany. Imagine if you will, sleeping in a monastery that was built in 1153. The massive, towering, stone hallways dwarf even the tallest and you feel a spirituality there that is reminiscent of the many monks who walked those hallowed halls. While Nasr worked, I wandered the endless bike path that goes from city to city. One day the trees sprouted the new green leaves of spring and the next they were blanketed in snow. The snow didn't last more than a few hours, but for a little while this Californian got a chance to amble in a winter-wonderland. Nasr is a Civil War buff, so considering we were on the East Coast, (an explanation will come later) we traveled to Charleston, South Carolina and Savanah, Georgia. Charleston, to both its detriment and its benefit, has changed very little since the Civil War. As there was no highway leading to it, it was isolated in time and space. So, when you visit, you will feel you time traveled back to the Civil War era. We were told that Charleston was once considered the Sodom and Gomorrah of the United States because the citizens of that city frequented theatres like those in Europe. Savanah has spectacular squares each heavily shaded and sporting a monument to a Southern hero all throughout the city. And for my war buff, this was the city where the first bullet of the Civil War was shot and now you know why we went there. \n",
    "\n",
    "After two weeks of staying in Carlsbad, we were on the road again. Poor Nasr had another conference. This one was held in Dijon, France. Yes, think mustard and yes I did bring home a few of their special recipes. We stayed at The Grand Hotel La Cloche which could easily pass for a palace. Dijon is a quaint little town that also has not changed much over the centuries. If you enjoy history, you will be mesmerized by the tea house from the 11th century-yes, it is the same building, touch the owl on Dijon's Notre Dame and your wish will come true-as long as you touch it with your left hand, and visit a Chateau that is also a winery. I learned that the area of Dijon is noted for the best wines. As Nasr was busy working, I was free to wander and walk the old streets and shop. Paris was a mere weekend, but we managed to dine in one of its most famous restaurants, walk the Champs Elysees, and savor a warm, chocolate crepe or two. YUM! Then we were on the move again. That Sunday, we breakfasted in Paris, lunched in Munich, Germany and had tapas in the evening in Madrid, Spain. We saw the beautiful architecture in Madrid, and learned that tapas are small plates of food, but what surprised us was the Egyptian Temple in the middle of Madrid. Do you know what Disney's magic castle is modeled after? The castle in Segovia, Spain. The original castle has the round turrets and pointed caps for the roof, just like Disney! Also, this archaic city has a towering, Roman aqueduct that is still in use. It spans almost 2500 feet, has more than 170 arches, and the highest arch is 87 feet high. Since we were in the \"neighborhood\", we had to see the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Little did we know you need to buy tickets months in advance. The only reason for this leg of our trip was to see the Moorish castle. Remember this is our honeymoon year and Nasr didn't want to disappoint me. So, at 5:30 am you found us sitting, back to back, on the hard, cold, and gritty, concrete sidewalk--in the dark, hoping and praying that we would get tickets. We did get those golden tickets, but we also had to go out and buy some Ben Gay for our aching joints and muscles. The main part of the castle is called Nasr's Castle. If you don't think that didn't go to his head, think again. The Arabic designs that cover the walls and ceilings are unique and breathtaking. Nasr found his name everywhere-I mean on every single wall. No Nasr, this is not your castle. I had to pull him kicking and screaming to the airport because he wanted to stay in his castle. Our yearlong honeymoon was phenomenal. We are staying home through the\n",
    "holidays, but we will be on the road again in January. We are heading to Puerta Vallarta, Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nasr found two hobbies this year. He decided he enjoyed refurbishing items, so he picked up the cookie pan that we have had since our wedding and used elbow grease, steel cleaning pads, a hard copper brush and lots of abrasive cleaners to clean it up. After hours of work in the sun, parts of it look great, some parts still need some work. I think he finally realized, it would be cheaper just to buy a new one-I think he spent more money on the cleaning materials than the cost of a new pan. He will most likely stay with his second hobby. He started golf lessons along with myself and some dear friends. Don't let anyone tell you that golf is easy. Your core muscles are in play every time you swing-and yes, we will let you know next year how this hobby turned out.\n",

    "Virginia is so happy that she retired for all the reasons listed above. I have been doing a little writing and I now have two little articles published in Woman's World Magazine. Let's see what happens next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amira, Matthew, Siena and Jada. Even though they are all the way across the country, we've been able to get together several times and will even for Christmas this year. The girls could tell their friends that they swam in two oceans this year. They celebrated the fourth of July in California and watched a kaleidoscopic firework show over the golf course from our back yard. Only a few weeks later, they traveled to Corolla, North Carolina to enjoy a week on the Outer Banks. Of course, we joined them. Amira knows how to pick vacation locales. We stayed in a huge Victorian home. The beach was five minutes away and the water was warm and welcoming. Nasr loves to eat something sweet with his coffee. Amira brought a box of Windmill cookies and she thought they would last the week. Nope. Once Nasr found them (I may have helped a little) they were gone in a day. Amira was a little disappointed that she didn't get any of the cookies. I felt bad so I sent three boxes to her in the mail. Jada told her mom when she looked in the box that the reason I sent them was because Gidu ate all the cookies. You cannot have a vacation without a little adventure but ours wasn't so little. We battened down the hatches and waited out Hurricane Hermine. Amira and Matthew grabbed the kids and hightailed it home before landfall. The wind slammed against walls and windows, like a giant wielding a huge sledge hammer. We were sure the windows would shatter. The house groaned and shingles went flying off the roof. We hunkered down on the narrow strip of land until it passed. Then it was onto Charleston-I told you I would explain. Siena, Jada and I worked on a book while we were in the Outer Banks. After watching all the antics of Gidu, we are going to write a book entitled. \"What Are We Going To Do With Gidu?\" Oh, by the way, Amira already sent us a picture of a cruise in the Norwegian Fiords. Will that be next year's vacation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam, Oanh, Olivia and introducing Gemma Lang Ghoniem! She waited to be born until after I finished last year's letter. She was born on 12/16/15-so she has her first birthday coming up. When I get the chance to babysit for Gemma I am in 7th heaven. Gemma is supposed to sleep in her bed, Mom and Dad are very good at that, but Teta-not so much. I gave her the bottle, put her on my shoulder to burp her and she fell asleep. Now, her parents are smart and they have a reclining chair in the baby's room. Sitting in that chair is so comfortable and it felt so good holding the baby, but I wanted to do what her parents asked. So, as I started to get up and put her in the crib, she woke up. She cried real tears! There was no way I could put her down now, that would be too cruel! There was nothing else I could do but let her comfortably settle down on my chest. It is a process for Gemma to wake up. First, she pushes her bottom up and then tucks her knees under her. Her head was firmly planted on my chest. I sensed her contemplating and trying to figure out a way to pick up such a heavy head-especially when it feels so good to be held. It took a good ten tries before she pulled it up and then slowly opened her unfocused eyes. I think I just witnessed how all of us wake up. Olivia loves being a big sister. She loves her sister and can give her bear hugs and long, suffocating kisses. Sometimes her enthusiasm is a little too much for Gemma and she needs to be saved from all that love. Olivia might be the actress of the family and/or the most adventurous. She tells her dad, \"Let's be dramatic!\" and \"Let's do something crazy!\" It makes dad a little worried. She is a very witty child. Her mother told her that when someone offers you food, you cannot say you do not like it. You MUST taste it before you say, no thank you. One day, Olivia made a concoction that she loves. She mushed Baby Bell cheese, Cheerios and blueberry yogurt into a ball. She gave it to her mother who said, \"No, thank you.\" Olivia told her mother that \"You can't say no thank you until you try it.\" It's tough when the tables are turned on you.\n",

    "Jasmine is working at Red Cross. Jasmine also has had a year of travels. Do you think it might be contagious? Her first was a road trip to Arizona and Utah. This may be hard for you to believe, it took me a while to wrap my head around it, but Jasmine likes camping. I mean real camping in the wilderness on the cold, hard, ground in the forest camping--not in a campground-camping. I thought the most camping she would ever do was camp in the Hilton. See your children can always surprise you-even at 30. She camped in Sedona, Bryce Canyon and Zion Canyon. She is also turning into a bit of a photographer. She takes beautiful pictures of spectacular and breathtaking nature. She also learned that cameras lose their charge in cold weather-and it was cold camping in the mountains. She celebrated her birthday in New Orleans, along with seven of her friends from school. She went to Detroit-two times-to visit friends. Her last adventure was a road trip up the entire West Coast-think San Francisco, Portland,Seattle and then went international as they drove into Vancouver, Canada-and all points in between. At least we know Nasr's car passed security, because it was searched before it could get into Canada. I don't want to know the details, and I don't need to know since she got home safely. Thank goodness for the locator device on her phone so I could see where she was at all times. I don't know what I could have done, but I felt she was\n",

    "Nasr, months away from completing another decade, has finally found a hobby. In fact, I am grateful that it took him so long to pick this particular hobby. He is learning to play the Egyptian drum called the Darbuka or as the Egyptians call it, a Tubla. He is taking on-line lessons. When someone starts playing a new instrument, it often is off tune, but a drum is a constant bum, bum, bum-bum-bum, bum, bum. He looks as if he is in a trance, just happily beating that drum. He beats it in the family room, he beats it in the living room, he beats it in the garage and he beats it in the backyard.\n",

    "Virginia, still 21-with an added brain-is loving retirement. I have the opportunity to be creative and I thoroughly enjoy it. Now, I get to live my life one chapter at a time, and quite often without any continuity from the previous chapter.\n",
    "My blog, www.lifeschapter.com compiles all my individual chapters. Being who I am, my chapters usually have a bit of humor in them. They also go into more details about our travels and mishaps. Some of our experiences are doozies!\n",
    "We have become vagabonds. We travel from place to place to place looking for adventure. We spent New Year's in Puerta Vallarta. We enjoyed both the winter and spring in Munich (spring was much warmer), especially for climbing to mountain castles, and visited dear friends in Salzburg and Vienna.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do a rainforest, king crabs and reindeer meat have in common? Alaska. Yes, we traveled the inner passage up to Seward. I had no idea Alaska had a rainforest, they get almost 150 inches of rain a year! The King Crabs were colossal and had a titanic taste. YUM! I must thank those fisherman on the Deadliest Catch-it is worth all their work. It took me a while to taste reindeer meat because I was afraid I was eating Rudolph, but I found reindeer meat is worthy of a second helping. Alaskan huskies-you know the snow sled dogs-are noisy and they are very thin. Movies show the cute, fluffy Siberian Huskies, but they are too slow and lazy for a real dog sled. Yup, we were pulled by 12 Alaskan Huskies through the wilderness. The only time they stop barking is when they are running. The Hubbard Glacier is massive, and we were within ¼ mile from it. The boat crew picked pieces of glacier ice from the water and I held it. It is so clear and clean you want to drink it right there. But don't, because your tongue would be permanently stuck to the ice. It is soooo cold. Trekking inland is another adventure. Inside Denali National Park we were within a hundred yards of a grizzly bear. For some reason when the bear started coming closer, the bus moved. I wonder why? Mount Denali, (formerly Mt. McKinley) the tallest mountain in the United States, stood at all its glory in the bright sunlight. It is very rare to see the entire mountain at once and we gazed in awe of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am so glad Nasr is still working because I get to travel with him to conferences, etc. I must admit I was a little leery about going to China because I had no real idea of what to expect. I found friendly, kind people who love to laugh. The sights in Beijing were awesome, but my favorite was our visit to the Terra Cotta Warriors in Xi 'an (pronounced She-an). These ancient relics were discovered in 1974 by a young farmer. As part of our tour, we had the opportunity to meet this farmer and shake his hand. The tour guide said he was very old, but Nasr and I think he is younger than us!  As long as Nasr was conferencing in Japan, we hightailed it down to Tokyo and took a tour to Mount Fuji-the tallest mountain in Japan. We ascended that one to the seventh station (via bus)-I wonder if we could ever get to the 10th station. Nope, we're too old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amira, Matthew, Siena and Jada, lead very busy lives. Their neighborhood is filled with young families, so they have countless number of opportunities for progressive dinners, movie nights, picnics, soccer, dance, gymnastics, and lots and lots of play dates for the girls. The girls have conquered skating, bike riding, swimming and diving. Each time I visit, Siena and Jada must have Tea with Teta. They are becoming much more sophisticated in their tastes. This year, we made cheese and cucumber tea sandwiches. We are still working on the tea aspect of a tea party. \"Tea\" looks more like juice and chocolate milk, but the etiquette of tea time remains the same. Oh, they had to remind me to put my little pinky up-they were a little disappointed in my behavior. The whole family went to Nashville to see the total eclipse of the sun. The day was beautiful and sunny and then eerie when the sun was covered. I must admit I am jealous because\n",

    "Adam, Oanh, Olivia and Gemma. The girls keep Oanh very busy! Olivia loves to ask why questions. Whenever anyone tells her something, she asks why. One day, she turned to her dad and asked, \"Why do I ask why?\" Does anyone have a good answer for that? Olivia, like her Teta, loves California Pizza Kitchen bread, but Olivia's true love is butter. She will eat only the inside squishy part of the bread. Once she has the bread in her hand, she digs it, yes digs it into the butter. If she can't get enough, she sticks her fingers into the butter to get more. Then she rubs the butter on her teeth as if she is brushing them with butter. Olivia is learning Spanish in school, mom speaks Vietnamese to her and Gidu speaks Arabic to her. They say the more languages you know, the better you do in school. Gemma is a character. She wears her hair on top of her head like Cindy Lou Who, but Gemma is cuter. She looks just like Adam did when he was her age, her body build and face. Speaking of her face, she makes the best sad faces in the universe. No one can resist her looks of disappointment or her shaky lower lip-except Mom. Mom has to warn me not to save Gemma. She is a little pistol, but she is so cute when you tell her no. Gemma loves to climb. She has no fear. She can easily climb out of car seats, up onto the table, out of the crib, and anywhere you don't want her to climb. Oanh thinks she is going to be a rock climber. I told her that most likely Gemma will climb Mr. Everest. Gemma is an eater. She can pack away 4 pieces of kid's pizza, a bowl of pasta, and then use the tomato sauce as make-up on her face. Adam has taken up the same hobby as his dad. They both are banging on the drums. They want to create their own band. Oh, and he plans on teaching Olivia how to play. What should they call themselves? And where can I hide?\n",

    "Jasmine loves San Diego. I think she found her nirvana here-except when her father wakes her up with a drum roll on his Darbuka. He says he must practice his fingering and waking her up gives him a chance to practice. Jazz has turned into an avid hiker. She will go for all day hikes and then come home and tell me, mom you cannot do that. It nearly killed me. Good to know my daughter doesn't want me to die on the hiking trails. The one trail that I wish she would not take is the one to Potato Chip Rock. Yes, it is a very thin rock overhanging a very deep canyon. I can't tell if she is brave or foolhardy, but she sits right on the edge of that rock. I am so glad when she gets home. Jazz is now Professor Ghoniem at National University. She has an adjunct professor position and loves teaching. She and her dad talk about their struggles with the deadbeat students and brainstorm solutions. Amira was here in September and she wanted to take Jasmine to Orange Theory with her. In my mind, I thought Orange Theory must have something to do with specialty orange drinks. I found out, it is a gym. Once Amira had Jazz signed up, they both worked on me to go. I had a thousand reasons not to go, but the biggest was that this gym is filled with YOUNG BEAUTIFUL people and I would stick out like a sore thumb. They begged me. I can't turn down an opportunity to hang with my grown children. Orange Theory is circuit training on treadmills, rowing machines and weights. I survived, barely. Then Jazz said she wanted to sign up.  Great. I encouraged her to sign up. \"No mom, I need you to go with me to encourage me.\"  I let her know I can encourage her from the couch, the kitchen table or wherever. No such luck. I ended up signing up with her. She is getter stronger every day. Thank goodness, the trainers there are kind to old people. I told Jazz, she has to get the song, \"I survived\" and play it every time we finish a workout.\n",

As William Shakespeare said, \"Our peace will stand as firm as rocky mountains.\" I pray that our peace and peace of mind will stand as firm as the mountains we've seen. we wish all our friends and family a peaceful, happy, healthy, and humorous New Year!\n"

    "Nasr had an award-winning year. The Egyptian American Organization presented him with a lifetime, Outstanding Achievement Award, by which he was very humbled. This, talent of his, I suggest, could be due to his \"Academic DNA.\" One of Nasr's students traced Nasr's Academic DNA, meaning, who were his professor's professor's professor etc. Nasr's Academic DNA can be traced back to Sir Isaac Newton. This year Nasr finally feels like he is a true \"Merican\" because he now has a huge 4' by 4' red, metal, tool box. From the time he started watching tv, he saw large tool boxes in American garages and he wanted one. This one box brought a myriad of changes. He re-did the garage flooring-it is clean enough to eat on--, he re-did all the cabinets, added new cabinets, and added special wall treatments to hang his tools. When the garage door is open, you can almost hear angelic voices singing. I soon discovered there is a disease in men that I never knew existed-\"garage envy.\" Men from the neighborhood stand in front of the house staring, drooling and sighing. Just yesterday, Nasr put a computer with a 40-inch monitor on the work bench. I was perplexed, but then I remembered he has turned our house into a smart home. He doesn't even have to come inside to control the house. The sprinklers are smart-if it rains they do not turn on, or if it is dry, they water longer. The lights turn on when asked-and can be set anywhere from 20 to 100 percent capacity. The thermostat regulates the temperature, and answers to voice command to warm up the house or cool it off. The speakers turn up or down and adjust to whatever level he wants, and he can merely ask Alexa for rock-n-roll songs or lullabies. On top of that, Alexa sets the timer for Nasr's coffee, salmon, and steaks. Being the professor, he is always testing and pushing the parameters of science. He asks Alexa very difficult questions. He has concluded that she knows longitude and latitude, but she is hopelessly inept with complex math equations. He will have to continue to work with Alexa to make his house a little smarter.\n",

    "Virginia loves retirement. Anyone who says they are bored in retirement are trying to be bored. As I am \"new\" to the San Diego area, I found a free continuing education course, called \"Rediscover San Diego.\" I've visited the Olympic Training Stadium, the Nibble Chocolate factory where they make chocolate from scratch-as in roasting the beans. They had to stop me from jumping into the vat. We also saw the San Diego Eye Center where they provide corneas worldwide. 10 percent of eye problems in the US are cornea related, while 90 percent worldwide are cornea related. I can't stop learning! I'm writing non-fiction, fiction and everything in-between. One would think that I have endless hours to write, but the days go by so fast that have a five-month backlog on my to-do list. One reason for the backlog is we like to travel. I started the New Year with Amira-Nasr stayed home-he is allergic to the cold. But, I did manage to bundle him up and surprise him for his 70th Birthday. We headed to Alaska-just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle-to see the Northern Lights. It was 19 degrees below zero at the top of the snowy mountain. We huddled in a yurt until 3 am in the morning, watching and waiting for the Northern Lights to appear. The previous night's snow blizzard formed spectacular show shapes on the trees, so Nasr got some great pictures. I loved our trip to Italy, especially, Positano. We rented a 16th century villa that overlooked the town square and the main beach. We ate late dinners and snacks on the balcony while watching the life of the city below-including fireworks. When I saw these beautiful villages nestled into cliffs, I never thought about how people got from the beach to the villas. There is a one-way road loaded with pedestrians, motorcycles, cars, no sidewalks, and shopkeepers pedaling their goods. The road takes longer and is too much of an obstacle course, so the answer is STEPS. Yes, steps. There are 500 steps-believe me-I counted them from the villa to the beach. Then when you go back, there are 500 more going UP!!! When Amira and Matt asked if I would mind staying upstairs to watch the girls and relax and enjoy the view while they navigated the steps for more fun, I said yes! Now, in Italy, one eats Pizza, Pasta, Pizza, Pasta, Pizza Pasta, GELATO!!! And, I didn't gain weight! The steps saved me.\n",
    "Amira, Matthew, Siena and Jada\n",
    "\n",
    "The highlight of the Koerner year was our trip to Rome and Positano. Amira and Matt lived the life of the rich and the famous-for one week at least. They strolled the same avenues as Denzel Washington-even tried to catch his eye, jumped into the refreshing Mediterranean waters right from the boat and bravely swam into and explored a cavernous c:ave. They lounged and sunbathed on the deck of the yacht drinking Prosecco and Limoncello. All while looking fabulous! Siena loves cats and in Italy she could spot a cat at 100 meters. Siena loves cats so much that she always wears a cat-ear headband. The ears can be sparkly, leopard, or 60's retro vinyl, it doesn't matter as long as she wears the ears. I learned her secret. She said whenever she looks in the mirror, she doesn't look right if she doesn't have cat ears on. Yes indeed­ she was a cat in a past life!\n",
    "Jada loves cats, too. She always brings her family of cats when she visits or travels. Her suitcase is filled with more cats than clothes. But she no longer has \"Stinky\" cat. Let me clarify that, she has the same stuffed animal that is still missing the ear and part of the tail that Jada gnawed off, but the cat no longer stinks. Why? Jada no longer chews on the poor animal, so it no longer stinks. I asked if she wanted to change Stinky's name, but she vehemently shook her head, no. Once a Stinky, Always a Stinky! Jada is an avid rock collector. She finds the prettiest rocks in Carlsbad and Positano­ which is about 100 or so each trip and she wants to take them back home with her. She is being very kind to her parents. She is not asking for pricey souvenirs. However, transporting them would cost hundreds of dollars. It is very difficult for her to pick her 5 favorites to take home. At least in Carlsbad, we have a rock garden for her. Does this mean she will take after her aunt and be a geologist?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam, Oanh, Olivia, Gemma,\n",
    "Whenever the Grandchildren visit, Olivia is the \"leader of the pack!\" (Can you hear the Grease song playing?) She and Jada are inseparable even though Jada is a year older. Olivia has inherited the clean gene from Gidu and Gidu is beaming with pride. His own children never showed this gene so early. Olivia organizes the family room and the toys after they finish playing, and she helped me organize their drinking glass cabinet. Every time Gidu compliments her on it, she struts around like a peacock, so proud and happy. Let's hope it lasts into the teenage years. Both Olivia and Gemma are actresses. Some might even call them drama queens. But, these two would play in very different movies. Olivia would be in a romantic comedy. Her quick wit and silliness attests to that. In addition, she loves to model and has great modeling stances, so she would be the leading lady. Gemma, however, is all about drama. She, like her father when he was her age, heads to the most precarious and dangerous spots leaving people (grandparents) breathless until she is rescued. Also, no one can do the suffering look as well as Gemma. She slouches her shoulders, drops her head in pure rejection, and to top it off, her lips quiver. She is so believable-except to her mother, who warns me not to fall for it. Gemma deserves an Academy Award for her acting. Gemma also has a sense of humor like her sister. Nasr played the \"Got Your Nose\" game and then he pretended to eat it. \"Did you like it?\" Gemma asked. \"Yes,\" Gidu said. \"Yum.\" Gemma then stuck her finger in her nose, pulled out a booger and offered it to Gidu. Now, how do you say Yucky after saying Yum? If you ever want to smile, watch Gemma as she parades through the house saying, \"I happy,\" and then repeats it over and over while flopping her head from side to side, \"I happy.\"\n",

    "Jasmine-I now have two more Grands-but they are not Grandchildren, but they are Grand-dogs! Jasmine-in our house-has an 11-month-old large, energetic, sweet, pretty, Husky named, Dakota. Her second charge is a three-month old, puppy named Juneau. Juneau is teething-meaning she chews on everything in sight, she wants to play non-stop by jumping on Dakota, play fighting and growling-sometimes sounding a little too real. At that point Jasmine takes them outside to do the \"Zoomies\"-running around in circles like fools until some of their energy is out of them. Dakota and Nasr like each other. Nasr and Juneau-don't! Max, the tiny, eight-pound Fox Terrier, is so happy that Juneau is here because now Dakota leaves him alone. Not only is Jasmine raising two dogs, she continues to teach at National University in Health Care Administration. She also creates courses and curriculum for the University. She is a substitute teacher and is taking classes to complete a second master's in education. We have now become a blended family-one steeped in long-time rivalry. Amira, a Bruin, graduated from UCLA, Nasr, a Bruin, is a professor at UCLA and Jasmine-(OMG!!) is getting her master's from USC. She just finished her first semester at USC, so there isn't too much Trojan blood in her yet. Let's hope we can overcome this silly divide and move on. My fingers are crossed in hope.\n",
    "Maybe if we can survive this divide and I'm sure we will, the world can overcome all sorts of divisions. Maybe we should ALL be a little more like Gemma and parade around saying \"I happy,\" and flop our heads from side to side. Maybe this would bring a little more light and happiness into the world.\n",

    "Nasr has a new look--he shaved his moustache after sporting one for over 40 years, and Virginia, still working on the novel, travelled more this year than almost any other year.  To capture our memories, Nasr was armed with his Nikon 850--say OOOH—it’s a special camera.  Note: If you ever travel with a photographer you either wait for them for get the “perfect” shot, or you sigh LOUDLY, and move ahead with the group.  I did a little of both.  All kidding aside, he is getting pretty good at taking photos and we have some interesting shots to prove it.  We travelled to the top of the mountains in Bryce Canyon, marveling at the impossibly shaped stone hoodoos (towers of rocks) that are constantly being carved by the wind, rain and snow.  We traversed the world and snorkeled under the turquoise sea, swimming and cavorting with the vibrant, multi-colored tropical fish of Australia and Tahiti.  This is what we did in-between and after. Colossal, red, granite-faced mountains towered over us like giant stone monsters, hovering silently as we wound through the narrow Zion Canyon.  In Melbourne, Australia we stood close enough to Fairy Penquins that we could have reached out and stroked their shiny backs.  These six-inch, blue penquins leave their nests at dawn, head straight to the ocean, spend the day fishing, and exactly at sunset, they all come waddling back to their shelters squawking a cacophony of peeps, donkey calls and moans.  Of course, we saw kangaroos, but a lovely little Koala mama shyly turned to me and showed me her baby. It was a such a kind, motherly gesture, I wanted to cry   Hamilton Island, Australia is the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. We braved the cold, winter seas—72 degrees F, donned our wetsuits and jumped—I don’t dive--into the open sea. A storm had badly damaged the reef a couple of years ago, so it has lost much of its beauty and luster.  Even though many fish have left the reef, it’s still a spectacular site to see. If you are looking for amazing, sleeping in the over-water bungalows in the warm South Pacific Ocean, is about as good as it gets. Imagine stepping off your back porch into bath-temperature water and entering a peaceful, calm world filled with hundreds of tiny, vividly colored fish. We donned a wet suit once more, but this time we had hand-held scooters that propelled us through the water. Our little scooters pulled us past huge schools of multi-colored fish, swimming, darting, and hiding in the indescribably beautiful, purple, blue and white corral. We discovered Stingrays are just like dogs—they follow you all around.  The ones, used to humans, bumped up against us to get our attention.  The white underbelly is so smooth and soft, and the top is as scratchy as a cow’s tongue.  Nope---we’re not done yet. Watching the blue, orange and purple sunset over the Mediterranean Sea in Alexandria, Egypt puts life in perspective.  How many people, and for how many thousands of years have humans watched the sun set over Egypt?  It certainly is a sight to see.  Nasr’s nephew, Mohamed married a lovely girl, Rodaina and we were so honored to be invited to the wedding.  Nasr tried to be a photographer but learned that being a wedding photographer is much harder than one would think. There is too much pressure to get it right, so Nasr has decided that wedding photography is one task he will never undertake.   After the wedding, we headed straight to the North Coast of Egypt and stayed in a beautiful resort with Nasr’s sister and family.  The Mediterranean water was beautiful and warm.  But the fish there were a little different than the ones in Tahiti.  These little silver fish loved to nip at people’s skin.  Since I wore sunscreen, they didn’t like my taste, so I was relatively safe. Others who “didn’t need” sunscreen were on the lunch menu!  Every few seconds you would hear someone shout or scream in surprise and maybe a little pain as the fish took their tiny bites. We spent hours in the water and when we weren’t in the water, we were at the cafes eating wonderful Egyptian rice pudding.  I don’t care what they say about all the other treasurers of Egypt, for me their rice pudding is their best treasure.  Luckily, we had a chance to spend time in Alexandria with some spectacular friends and family.  Wait-there’s more—we’re going to Egypt and Jordan on Dec. 22—but you’ll have to wait to hear about that next year! \n",

    "Amira, Matthew, Siena (10), Jada (8-by the time you read this) traveled along the U.S. Southern Eastern Seaboard this year frolicking on an island and discovering new sea creatures.  Siena celebrated her first double digit birthday in August with a trip to Sea World.  Siena’s giggles and merriment caught by the lazy breeze wafted over the park as the crazy antics of the sea lions entertained us all.  Siena’s next rite of passage was to ride the big girl rollercoaster, The Journey to Atlantis. She loved it!  Wanted to do it again! However, I now know when and why kids stop listening to their parents. Before the ride started, Amira convinced Jada that she was ready at 8 years old for a big rollercoaster and it would be FUN! Well, the look on Jada’s face when she got off was not the look of a child that just had fun.  She looked as if she had been tortured. I would have had the same look if I went on it, too.  Her mom kept telling her—to prevent hysterical crying—that it was so much fun.  If I was Jada, I would never believe my mom again. (That was the same trick my family played on me.  No, I never go on roller coasters!)  Amira has always loved Egyptian food but hasn’t made a lot of it.  This year, she put together a complete meal of Egyptian foods, including stuffed grape leaves for a large group of friends.  She followed the same recipes that my friends gave to me over 40 years ago.  The meal was a success, as I knew it would be. Siena has discovered riddles and she loves to tell them to Gidu—hoping she will stump him.  Riddle me this: What can't a person hold for long that is lighter than a feather?  Another is:  You are in a dungeon with a bucket of water and a hamburger. You want to get out. There are 2 doors. Behind one door is a lagoon full of sharks. Behind the other door is a blazing fire. How do you escape?  Don’t worry, I’ll give you the answers, but take your time to figure it out.  Jada takes after her mom and is a soccer star!  Of course, it helps that Mom is the team coach.  Siena loves tumbling and wherever you find her she is doing a cartwheel or a round off.  She takes after Teta-who at one time did love tumbling and wasn’t bad at it. But now, I spend a lot of time just tumbling over, and I’m not trying anything more complicated than putting one foot in front of the other.\n",

    "Oanh, Olivia (7 in February), Gemma (4 by the time you read this) and Adam. Nasr and I took the girls to Zion Canyon at the end of May.  I don’t know if Olivia and Gemma enjoyed the view as much as their mother and us, but they did love having a snowball fight in Bryce Canyon. Those kids have a good aim—and they spent a lot of time aiming at me.  We rented a house that slept 13!  The girls loved the house because they slept in double-size bunk beds!  Olivia kept telling us that she wanted to go to the holiday.  We explained to her, as we checked out the sights, that seeing the canyons was our holiday.  Oh no. The holiday was the house with the bunk beds!  I wish I had a quarter of the energy of these two girls, I would solve all the world problems in one day. Gemma has her own interpretation of how to say some words “Otay” is Okay and when she sees something that is cute, she says, “It’s ado-bul.”  Translation: adorable.  Both girls have extensive vocabulary, it just takes a little sleuthing to figure out what they are saying sometimes. Gemma used to be shy when she was around people, but not so much anymore. While she peeks through her bangs that hang in her face, she strikes a coquettish pose and then proceeds to tell delivery men and friends her life story. Last weekend Olivia told Gidu that she was planning on having ten hundred kids.  Yes, that is 1000 children. Then she proceeded to tell him that she and her kids will come and live at our house so Gidu can still take care of her and her kids.  The kicker was that she was going to start having all these kids at 18. That was when we put the brakes on that idea.  We would take care of her 1000 children, but she had to get a college degree first—that was NON-NEGOTIABLE. Anyone have any space for a “few hundred” extra kids?\n",

    "Jasmine has informed me that I have 4 grandchildren and 2 grand-dogs!  I spend more time taking care of them than I do of all my grandchildren combined.  Jasmine is interning so I “babysit” her two gorgeous huskies, Dakota and Juneau during the day.  We are constantly tripping over toys!  Oh no, they are not the grandchildren’s toys.  They are dog toys.  You can convince children to pick up their toys after a little cajoling, but dogs will NEVER pick up their toys! Remember, dog toys are usually covered in disgusting slobber! To be fair to Adam’s kids, these dogs have even more energy than his girls.  We informed Jasmine that when she starts working full time, she is finding a dog sitter for them.  Jasmine will finish her SECOND Masters in June.  This one is in education.  She still teaches Public Health Administration at National University. She is very busy.  She is teaching at National, interning at a local high school and taking on-line courses from University of Southern California (USC). She occasionally comes out of her room to say hello, but then heads back inside to study some more.   But now, we have a problem. We have the two major rival universities in Los Angeles living in one household.  UCLA AND USC.  Pray we will survive it.  \n",
