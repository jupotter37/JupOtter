    "Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is unique as a statistical discipline in that it develops techniques and models for describing the unusual rather than the usual, e.g., it is focused in the tail of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, extreme values are scarce, meaning that estimates are often required for levels of a process that are much greater than have already been observed. This implies an extrapolation from an small set of observed levels to unobserved levels. Extreme Value Theory provides models to enable such extrapolation."

    "One of the earliest books on the statistics of extreme values is [E.J. Gumbel (1958)](http://www.worldcat.org/title/statistics-of-extremes/oclc/180577). Research into extreme values as a subject in it’s own right began between 1920 and 1940 when work by E.L. Dodd, M. Frêchet, E.J. Gumbel, R. von Mises and L.H.C. Tippett investigated the asymptotic distribution of the largest order statistic. This led to the main theoretical result: the [Extremal Types Theorem](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/ExtremalTThm.pdf) (also known as the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem, the Fisher–Tippett theorem or the extreme value theorem) which was developed in stages by [Fisher, Tippett and von Mises, and eventually proved in general by B. Gnedenko in 1943](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Tippett%E2%80%93Gnedenko_theorem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Until 1950, development was largely theoretical. In 1958, Gumbel started applying theory to problems in engineering. In the 1970s, [L. de Haan, Balkema and J. Pickands generalised the theoretical results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickands%E2%80%93Balkema%E2%80%93de_Haan_theorem) (the second theorem in extreme value theory), giving a better basis for statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the 1980s, methods for the application of Extreme Value Theory have become much more widespread."
