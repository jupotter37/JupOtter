    "### 1.1 Literature review of the compound\n",
    "Malaria is a parasitic, life-threatening disease which is both preventable and curable. In 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases worldwide, causing approximately 627 thousand deaths according to the WHO. 95% of those malaria cases took place in Africa, often in poor, rural areas with limited access to proper medical attention [1]. To combat malarial infections, high quantities of low-cost antimalarial drugs are crucial to making treatment accessible. Artemisin is a potent antimalarial drug which could possibly provide an answer to the large death toll of malaria alltogether. However, production of artemisin is currently too expensive to be widely accessible in rural africa, mostly due to low yields in the production methods. Artemisinin global market size was estimated at USD 61 Million as 2021 [2]. The demand for the product has risen dramatically after the World Health Organization recognized it as a first-line treatment for malaria [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Artemisin is currently being industrially produced through one of two methods. Firstly, through *Artemisia annua*, a plant which is natively able to synthesisze artimesin from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). However, production using *A. annua* is too slow and costly to meet market demands [4]. Therefore a second alternative was developed by Ro et al. (2006) [5]. They used *A. annua*'s artemisin pathway as a framework for engineering an artemisin-producing cell factory. However, the final step of the artemisin pathway, conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisin, is currently unknown. Therefore, they decided to engineer the production of artemisinic acid in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, and chemically synthesize the final step of the production, as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure above is adapted from Li et al. (2016) [4]. The engineered biosynthetic pathway above starts at FPP, which is a precursor for steroids in both plants and fungi, and it stems from the mevalonate pathway. From there amorphadiene synthase (ADS) cleaves off the pryophoshpate group to close the ring structures in the molecule, resulting in 4,11-amorphadiene. Cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP71AV1) catalyzes the monooxidation of 4,11-amorphadiene into artemisinic alcohol, which is further oxidised artemisinic aldehyde and finally artemisinic acid via NAD-dependent artemisinic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) and artemisinic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) respectively. The conversion from artemisinic acid into artemisinin is generally considered feasible because it's performed at a low cost, with high yields in industry already [6]. Thus, an efficient cell factory, generating high yields of artemisinic acid could be the answer to finding a low-cost antimalarial drug. "

    "Aspergillus niger is a filamentous fungus, which can be found in almost every habitat on earth, including soil, ocean water and arctic ice. After germination of a spore, the fungus grows as hyphae, branching filaments that form the mycelial network on solid substrate, or pellet-like mycelial aggregates in submerged liquid culture [7]. Its high growth rate, relatively short life cycle and ability to grow on a variety of substrates account for A. nigerâ€™s robustness and ubiquity in nature. [8][9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapted to its lifestyle of a decomposer of organic matter, it has an enormous productivity and secretion capability of proteins, acids and small molecules. This has been exploited by industry to produce a vast number of organic acids, enzymes, biopharmaceuticals and secondary metabolites, making it an important workhorse in biotechnology. [10]\n",
    "In competition and symbiosis with other fungi and microorganisms, it evolved an extensive SM production machinery of, amongst others, sesquiterpenoids, to compete and communicate with surrounding organisms. Genome-mining revealed that 99 core SM synthase enzymes are present in A. niger, which highlights its potential as SM cell factory [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "Being extensively used in biotechnological manufacturing and research, A. niger is a well-studied production host with a variety of synthetic biology tools available for genetic engineering. Besides Crispr-Cas9 for genome editing [12] and RNAi systems for gene-knock down [13], multiple highly optimized inducible promoters have been developed for controlled gene expression [14]. Numerous scientific papers and several genome-scale models provide a solid data basis for in-silico cell-factory engineering [15][16].\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of A. niger is its natural phenotype of branching filaments, which poses challenges for the fermentation process, since the mycelial aggregates increase viscosity and limit oxygen transfer. Also, it is not as well understood and has a smaller molecular toolbox than S. cerevisiae [17].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous potential alternative cell factories for the production of artemisinic acid. Prerequisite is the presence of a precursor in the metabolism. It can be farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) like in this report, but technically could also be upstream of FPP, when the enzymes for the production of FPP are included in the heterologous pathway. However, the host should be chosen to provide a precursor as close to the final product as possible, to make use of the natural synthesis capabilities of the wild-type metabolism. FPP is part of the mevalonate pathway, which is present in all eucaryotes and archaea, and in some bacteria [18]. It is used to produce sesquiterpenoids, an extremely diverse class of secondary metabolites, of which many have bioactive properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the majority of pharmaceutical sesquiterpenoids are extracted from plants, which highlights their superior production capabilities [19]. The largest share of artemisin production globally is contributed by its natural production host, the plant Artemisia annua. Alternatively, industrial production hosts like tobacco or algae could harness the sesquiterpenoid synthesis potential of plants [20]. However, since industrial-scale production of plants is challenging, the biosynthetic pathway for artemisinic acid was introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fermentation-based manufacturing [17]. S. cerevisiae is the best known eucaryotic production host and extensively used for biosynthetic pathway engineering, but its SM production machinery and secretion capability are inferior to A. niger [21].\n",

    "By default, the model uses a simple media consisting of 10 mM glucose, while also supplying all essential elements, such as nitrogen and oxygen, in ample amounts. To find the optimal media for both growth and production of artemisinic acid, an empirical analysis of various common carbon sources (Glucose, Fructose, Fumarate, Pyruvate, Lactose & Maltose) was conducted, calculating the maximal theorhetical yield and productivity for each carbon source at 10 mM concentrations. The results are summarized in **Table 4** below. An interesting point to note was that the model seems to favor sugars as a carbon source, but not much difference was expressed between different sugars. The main difference is that disaccharides showed exactly twice the productivity and growth as monosaccharides, which can be explained by them containing twice as much carbon. This was confirmed by running a simulation with 20 mM glucose, which yielded the same results as 10 mM disaccharides. Analysis of these yields through phenotypic phase plane diagrams show similar results as descrbed in **Table 4**, except the discrepency of carbon availability in the source is not directly acounted for there.

    "One of the most common growth media for fungal production strains in industry is Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) media [29]. As the name implies, it consists of yeast exrtact, peptone and dextrose. Since peptone and yeast extract are very difficult to accurately quantify for a simulation, a YPD-mimicking media was used for our simulations, containing 18 amino acids as well as the metals we could find in our model (Zinc and iron). By simulating growth on YPD media, significantly higher productivity rates were found, both for biomass production and artemisinic acid. This is hardly a surprise as the carbon availability in YPD is far greater than what has been simulated so far. Therefore, the glucose-equivalent of YPD was calculated using the number of carbons in each amino acid as a baseline. In this case, the model seems to favor growth on pure glucose over YPD media, showing that it accounts for *A. niger* being able to metabolize glucose more efficiently than amino acids. However, in a realistic scenario, nitric acid would not be provided in the growth media, so a final test was conducted where nitric acid was removed from the model. Growth rates on YPD are not affected by the removal of nitric acid. On glucose, however, the cells died due to lack of nitrogen. Therefore, even though it has a slightly lower yield than glucose, YPD is a more realistic growth medium for production of artemisinic acid. These results are summarized in **Table 5** below.

    "## 5. Discussion\n",
    "The production of artemisinic acid in A. niger requires the intact functionality of the enzymes forming the heterologous pathway. Due to the phylogenetic distance to Artemisia annua, being in another kingdom of life, folding, glycosylation and therefore function of the enzymes might be impaired. We assume sufficient functionality, which however might require protein engineering like codon-optimization beforehand, but still poses the risk of non-feasability. To minimise this risk, enzymes of the pathway could be expressed transiently in A. niger as a proof-of-concept approach. Simple western-blotting could prove expression of the genes, and enzyme activity assays after purification could provide insight to enzyme functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the model ATCC1015 out of five possible models that were published in the last five years, after Memote analysis resulted in the best annotation and overall score. However, since it is not a standardized BiGG model, it lacks meaningful nomenclature for the reactions, which impairs readability and functionality of tools like Escher and Cameo. Moreover, many non-essential pathways for the synthesis of secondary metabolites are not annotated, compromising the quality of model predictions. Ideally, the recently published enzyme constraint model eciJB1325 could be used, giving better predictions by including enzyme kinetics data. We decided against that, since there is no kinetic data available for our heterologous pathway, which will presumably be the rate-limiting step in artemisinic acid production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison to the S. cervisiae model iMM904 indicated a generally higher artemisinic acid productivity and growth rate for A. niger, which shows the great potential of the host, at least in silico. One possible explanation of the high productivity is that there is a naturally high flux into the precursor FPP in the mevalonate pathway. FPP is used for the production of sesquiterpenoids, a very large and diverse group of secondary metabolites, including artemisinic acid. A. niger has a naturally high repertoire of sesquiterpenoids, presumably to compete with other microorganisms in its predominant niche, terrestrial soil. Furthermore, the flux from the precursor to the heterologous pathway could further be improved by knockouts of the mostly non-essential SM synthase enzymes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium optimization can be a very effective and easy-to-implement way of increasing productivity. Our simulation of different carbon sources showed that hexose mono- and disaccharides provide identical efficiency in terms of biomass production and productivity. Therefore, we chose glucose as the main carbon source as it is the cheapest. The complex medium YPD is the most employed in industry, but due to its undefined ingredients difficult to simulate. By mimicking those components with amino acids and trace elements, we could circumvent this issue and additionally remove the dependency of the model to add nitric acid to the simulation, bringing it closer to reality. YPD medium provided the best growth conditions, so a new model baseline was created utilizing the new media specifications as well as a minimum constraint on biomass productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of the pathway in Escher enabled us to identify four potential knock out candidates. However, we expected to identify more, considering the high abundance of sesquiterpenoid synthase enzymes described in literature. Reason for that is presumably the incomplete annotation of SM synthase reactions in the model. We used FSEOF to identify targets for up- and downregulation of protein expression, resulting in a list of 19 reactions. Upregulation targets are mainly directly linked to the production of FPP or in the heterologous pathway itself, which was expected. Furthermore, the upregulation of a phosphate exchange reaction was suggested. This is very plausible, since the reactions linked to artemisinic acid production are energy intensive and could benefit from an overall higher phosphate influx."

    "## 6. Conclusion \n",
    "Artemisin remains the most effective and most important drug against malaria to this day. Finding a highly productive microbial host for the heterologous production of its precursor, artemisinic acid, could help serving the increasing global demand for the drug while reducing the price. The aim of this project was to investigate the potential of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger as host organism. Therefore, we used an existing GSM and introduced the artemisinic acid pathway for heterologous production. By applying in-silico engineering strategies such as media optimization, gene knock-outs and FSEOF, we could identify targets for process- and metabolic optimization. We could show that A. niger has a high potential as production host for artemisinic acid, exceeding the productivity of S. cervisiae, which is the only organism engineered for the heterologous production of the compound so far. These findings are promising, however only theoretical and must be validated by experimentation."
