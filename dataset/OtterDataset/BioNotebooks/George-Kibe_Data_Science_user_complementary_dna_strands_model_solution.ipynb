    "In coding challenge 2, you were introduced to RNA synthesis. DNA differs from RNA because RNA is one strand compared to DNA which is double stranded. It also differs in that instead of the U nucleotide, it contains a T. Below is an example of the different structures taken from https://byjus.com/biology/difference-between-dna-and-rna/:\n",
    "\n",
    "The same lab was extremely impressed with the first code and now wants a new one. They want to find the complementary strands of DNA. Here is the low-down:\n",

    "A links with T and vice versa\n",
    "C links with G and vice versa\n",
    "An example of the complementary strand for the code ATCGGAATGCC is TAGCCTTACGG\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked to create a function dna_complementary which finds the complementary strand for a given DNA strand based on the above criteria. The function must return a string of the code\n",

    "This kind of code can be really helpful as a product. Imagine trying to get DNA strands for thousands of sequences which are thousands of nucleotides long. This is the power of python and coding!\n",
