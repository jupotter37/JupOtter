    "- Data structures and algorithms is a study area of the theoretical computer science field in the discipline of computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An algorithm is a proceedure or fomula for solving a problem.\n",
    "- Big-O notation: a notation that compares algorithms based on how fast they run and how much memory (space) they use to run, independent of hardware. It examines how **quickly an algorithm's runtime grows** (not exact runtimes) relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large, also known as the algorithm's complexity.\n",
    "- An algorithm's complexity can either be time (above) or space (amount of resource it uses in computing a result)\n",
    "- Time complexity can be determined by evaluating the number of assignmnents/ operations an algorithm makes relative to the input size.\n",
    "- Big-O uses the 'n' notation to represent input size, so that various input sizes can be used to analyze the run-time alogrithm's growth.\n",
    "- As n becomes arbitrarily large, the concern is only on the terms that grow the fastest relative to n thus constants are not conisdered in big-O notation analysis.\n",
    "- Big-O analysis is considered asymptotic (describing limiting behaviour) i.e a function f(n + 1) may be considered asymptotically equal to to another f(n) as the value of n becomes arbitrarily large or as the limit is approached.\n",
    "\n",
    "_See function algo_analysis below for Big O breakdown demo_\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common Big-O notations/ functions that can be used to evaluate an algorithm are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  1. Constant time O(1): the computation time does not grow when the input size grows.\n",
    "  2. Logarithmic O(Log n): the computation time scales half as much relative to the size of the input\n",
    "  3. Linear time O(n): the computation time scales linearly with the input size.\n",
    "  4. Log Linear time O(nlog n): Combines the log & linear time complexities.\n",
    "  5. Polynomial time O(n^c) : these grow c times the size of the input, where c is a constant and c > 1.           \n",

    "### Amortized Time Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is an algorithm design pattern, useful when performing a series of operations such that we break even in terms of the operations' costs, combined. By using this approach we can then 'pay' for an expensive operation by preceeding it with a number of cheap operations and accumulating their savings to use use on the upcoming expensive operation.\n",
    "- The motivation for this approach is that taking the worst-case for such operations can be too pesimistic and as such a more realistic approach is preferred, that looks at the actual operations' costs and cost bounds e.g time/operations.\n",
    "- So rather than having one sort operation for an array, look at a series of sorts, look-ups, deletes to a database and strive to make them efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The amortized cost per operation of a sequence of n operations is their total cost / n_\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if we have 100 operations at cost 1, followed by one operation at cost 100, the amortized cost per operation is 200/101 < 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reason for considering amortized cost is that we will be interested in data structures that occasionally can incur a large cost as they perform some kind of rebalancing or improvement of their internal state, but where such operations cannot occur too frequently. In this case, amortized analysis can give a much tighter bound on the true cost of using the data structure than a standard worst-case-per-operation bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A Potential function is a function of the state of a system, that generally should be non-negative and start at zero and is used to smooth out the anaylysis of some algorithm or process.\n",
    "- The potential function is like a bank account where we put the savings from the cheap operations to use on the expensive functions when needed and for purposes of this model, it should never be negative otherwise the model fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: implementing a stack as an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to use an array to implement a stack. We have an array A, with a variable top that points to the top of the stack (so A[top] is the next free cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "• To implement push(x), we just need to perform: A[top] = x; top++;\n",
    "• To implement x=pop(), we just need to perform: top--; x = A[top]; \n",
    "\n",
    "`Cost: generally O(1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if the array is full and we need to push a new element on?\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case we can allocate a new larger array, copy the old one over, and then go on from there. This is going to be an expensive operation, so a push that requires us to do this is going to cost a lot. `{O(n) + (1)}`\n",
    "\n",
    "But maybe we can “amortize” the cost over the previous cheap operations that got us to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, on average over the sequence of operations, we’re not paying too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, let us define the following cost model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost model: \n",
    "Let’s say that inserting into the array costs 1, taking an element out of the array\n",
    "costs 1, and the cost of resizing the array is the number of elements moved. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Say that all other operations, like incrementing or decrementing “top”, are free.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: What if when we resize we just increase the size by 1? Is that a good idea?\n",
    "Answer 1: Not really. If our n operations consist of n pushes then we will incur a total cost\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2. That’s an amortized cost of (n + 1)/2 per operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What if we instead decide to double the size of the array when we resize?\n",
    "Answer 2: This is much better. Now, in any sequence of n operations, the total cost for resizing is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2i for some 2i < n (if all operations are pushes then 2i will be the largest power of 2 less than n). \n",
    "\n",
    "This sum is at most 2n − 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding in the additional cost of n for inserting/removing, we get a total cost < 3n, and so our amortized cost per operation is < 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to look at this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the sum of 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 +... +X? If you read this sum left to right, it starts with 1 and doubles until it gets to X. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you read right to left, it starts with X and halves until it gets to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "What then is the sum of X + X/2 + X/4 + X/8 + ... + 1? This is roughly 2X. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, X insertions take O( 2X) time.The amortized time for each insertion is O(1) ."

    "  - Computer memory is designed so that any byte can be accessed efficiently e.g constant time thus the name RAM.\n",
    "  - Programming languages keep an association between an identifier e.g varible name and the memory address for           value stored in memory.\n",
    "  - A group of related variables can be stored in a contiguous (neighbouring) portion of memory, which can be deonted as an array.\n",
    "  - A text string is stored an an ordered sequence of unicode characters.\n",
    "  - Python stores each character using 16bits (2 btyes). Thus \"SAMPLE\" would take 12 consequtive bytes of memory each with a unique address.\n",
    "  - Each location within an array(2bytes always) is a cell, which uses an index to describe its location.\n",
    "  - Memory addresses used to find any item in memory can then be computed in constant time to find any location by using the formula:\n",
    "  \n",
    "$$Start Cell Address = Array Start Address + (Cell Size * Index)$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "B) Referential Arrays (High level abstraction): \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using arrays to represent any number of strings but to ensure access to any of them is done efficiently i.e           constant time, then each cell of the array must have the same number of bytes, and in python for characters its 2.\n",
    "- The solution is not to have arrays of the characters (objects) themselves rather have arrays of references to the     objects stored in memory, and each of the array cells will have 2 bytes.\n",
    "- Python stores arrays in this manner as object references and as such all array operations involve creating or         changing references to objects, often a list may contain multiple references to the same object and an object may     be referenced by multiple lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    " - List slicing results to a new list but referencing/pointing the same old objects in the original list.\n",
    " - Re-assignment: e.g of a list items to another list will result in the new list pointing to the old list items. If    one of the cells of the new items is assigned a different value not in the original list, then a new object is        created away from the two list and the cell pointed to that new object.\n",
    " - Shallow copies ie. backup = list(primes), duplicates the previous object's reference list, thus if the objects are    mutable, changing the object reference from the new list, will change the old list references as well.\n",
    " - Deep copies: if the object are mutable, you can create a new list with new references using the deepcopy function,    thus the two list will now be independent.\n",
    " - counter = [0]*8 means create a list of 8 cells all with zeros, but this actually creates one integer object and a    list counter with 8 cells all referencecing the one object. counter [2] +=1, will create a new object as per the      operation and change the reference of cell [2] to the new object.\\\n",
    " - primes.extend(extras), means that references to the objects referenced by the extras list are added to the end of    the primes reference list.\n",

    "C) Dynamic arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python you dont need to specify the array size when creating one. Python already holds some memory, usually abit   larger than is curently needed and as the list grows, it will grab more memory in stages and again abit more that     it needs at that point in time. See demo below.\n",
    "- Theoretical implementation of a dynamic array: beginning with the first-sized array (A), create a second array (B)   twice the size of the orginal one. Create reference in array B to point to the objects currently in array A, then     reassign reference of array A to array B and garbage collect the memory previously used by array A, so now we have   new array A with all the object references as before but with additional memory space."

    "    - Heap property: the key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to       (≤) the keys in the node's children, according to some total order (transitive relation between the keys).\n",
    "    - Heaps where the parent key is greater than or equal to (≥) the child keys are called max-heaps; those where       it is less than or equal to (≤) are called min-heaps.\n",

    "- Binary heaps are also commonly employed in the heapsort sorting algorithm, which is an in-place algorithm because binary heaps can be implemented as an implicit data structure (using little info to describe its structure), storing keys in an array and using their relative positions within that array to represent child-parent relationships.\n",

    "- Is the process of mapping values to slots in a data structure e.g an array. The slots in this case are represented by indices where the values will/are stored in the array.\n",
    "- Hashing results in a highly efficient search time complexity of O(1), because the location/index of any value in the array computed and then used to directly access it without having to iterate over the array.\n",
    "- Hashing results in a hash table which is a collection of items that are stored in SLOTS, named by an integer value starting from 0, with all slots initialled with a None value and the size of the hash table m = len(hash_table).\n",
    "- The mapping between the items and their slots in a hash table is called a hash function.\n",
    "- It takes any item in a range of item and the size of the hash table and returns an integer value within the range of the hash table slot names i.e (0, m-1).\n",
    "- There are various ways a hash function achieves this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashing - Remainder Method**\n",
    "- Determines the value slot names as (value % m).\n",
    "- The load factor denoted by lambda is the number of values out of the availble slots in the hash table that are ready to be filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = {{numberOfItems}\\over tableSize}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Functions\n",
    "- A **Collision** is occurs when the hash function attempts to assing two different items to the same slot e.g\n",
    " 44%11 = 0 and 77%11 = 0\n",
    "- A hash function that maps each item into a unique slot is referred to as a **perfect hash function**\n",

    "#### Collision Resolution / Rehashing Methods\n",
    "**1. Open Addressing**\n",
    " - This method tries to find the next availble slot in the hash table, sequentialy, to place the item that caused the collision, a process called **linear probing**\n",
    "- This methods also clusters items at the begining fo the hash table.\n",
    "- To decluster the items and distribute them evenly in the hash table and fulfil goal 3 above is to skip slots rather than probing in intervals of 1.\n",
    "- One such method for rehashing while declustering is called **quadratic probing** where a rehashing function increments the original hash value \"h\" by 1,3,5,7,9...... ie h+1, h+3.....\n",

    "## Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "- When deciding which sorting algorithm to use, the following criteria can be used for comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Time Complexity (Big-O notation). You should note that best-case, worst-case and average run-time can have        different time complexity. For example best-case for Bubble Sort is only O(n), making it faster than              Selection Sort when the original list is mostly in order (not many elements out of place).\n",
    "    2. Memory Complexity. How much more memory is required to sort a list as n grows?\n",
    "    3. Stability. Does the sort preserve the relative ordering of elements that have equivalent sort values? (For        example if you were sorting a list of catalog items by their price, some elements may have equal prices. If        the catalog was originally sorted alphabetically by item name, will the chosen sort algortihm preserve the        alphabetical ordering within each group of equal-priced items.)\n",
    "    4. Best/Worst/Averavge number of comparisons required. Important when compare operations are expensive. (For          example: comparing efficiencies of alternative designs where efficiency is calculated via some simulation          or otherwise complex calculation).\n",
    "    5. Best/Worst/Average number of swap operations required. Important when swap operations are expensive. (For          example: sorting shipping containers that must be physically moved on the deck of a ship)\n",
    "    6. Code size. Bubble-sort is known for its small code footprint.\n",
    "    \n",
