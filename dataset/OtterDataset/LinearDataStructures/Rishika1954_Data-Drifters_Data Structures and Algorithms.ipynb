    "Data structures are fundamental constructs around which you build your programs. They are a way of organizing and storing data to enable efficient access and modification. Choosing the right data structure can significantly affect the performance of an algorithm. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.\n",

    "Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. An algorithm takes some input and transforms it into the desired output. The efficiency of an algorithm is often measured in terms of its time complexity (how the runtime increases with the size of the input) and space complexity (how the memory usage increases with the size of the input)."
