    "It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LIFO( Last In First Out ):\n",
    "This strategy states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.\n",

    "## Understanding stack practically:\n",
    "There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider the simple example of plates stacked over one another in a canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow the LIFO/FILO order.\n",

    "# Stack in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a linear data structure that stores items in a **Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)** or **First-In/Last-Out (FILO)** manner. In a stack, a new element is added at one end, and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called **push** and **pop**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions Associated with Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `empty()` – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "2. `size()` – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "3. `top()` / `peek()` – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "4. `push(a)` – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "5. `pop()` – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to implement a stack in Python. Let's explore some of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using a List:**\n",
    "   - Python's built-in data structure **list** can be used as a stack.\n",
    "   - Instead of `push()`, we use `append()` to add elements to the top of the stack.\n",
    "   - `pop()` removes the element in LIFO order.\n",
    "   - However, the list has a few shortcomings:\n",
    "     - It can run into speed issues as it grows.\n",
    "     - If the stack grows bigger than the block of memory that currently holds it, Python needs to do some memory allocations.\n",
    "     - This can lead to some `append()` calls taking much longer than others."

    "## Applications of Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack is a simple linear data structure used for storing data. Stack follows the LIFO(Last In First Out) strategy that states that the element that is inserted last will come out first. You can take a pile of plates kept on top of each other as a real-life example. The plate which we put last is on the top and since we remove the plate that is at the top, we can say that the plate that was put last comes out first.  It can be implemented through an array or linked lists. Some of its main operations are: push(), pop(), top(), isEmpty(), size(), etc.  In order to make manipulations in a stack, there are certain operations provided to us. When we want to insert an element into the stack the operation is known as the push operation whereas when we want to remove an element from the stack the operation is known as the pop operation. If we try to pop from an empty stack then it is known as underflow and if we try to push an element in a stack that is already full, then it is known as overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Stack Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. void push(int data): When this operation is performed, an element is inserted into the stack.\n",
    "2. int pop():   When this operation is performed, an element is removed from the top of the stack and is returned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary Stack Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### top():\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation will return the last inserted element that is at the top without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### size():\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation will return the size of the stack i.e. the total number of elements present in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### isEmpty():\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation indicates whether the stack is empty or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### isFull():\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation indicates whether the stack is full or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Stacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Register Stack:** This type of stack is also a memory element present in the memory unit and can handle a small amount of data only. The height of the register stack is always limited as the size of the register stack is very small compared to the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Stack:** This type of stack can handle a large amount of memory data. The height of the memory stack is flexible as it occupies a large amount of memory data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is meant by Top of the Stack?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pointer through which the elements are accessed, inserted, and deleted in the stack is called the top of the stack. It is the pointer to the topmost element of the stack.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Application of Stack Data Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stack is used for evaluating expressions with operands and operations.\n",
    "- Matching tags in HTML and XML.\n",
    "- Undo function in any text editor.\n",
    "- Infix to Postfix conversion.\n",
    "- Stacks are used for backtracking and parenthesis matching.\n",
    "- Stacks are used for the conversion of one arithmetic notation to another arithmetic notation.\n",
    "- Stacks are useful for function calls, storing the activation records, and deleting them after returning from the function. It is very useful in processing the function calls.\n",
    "- Stacks help in reversing any set of data or strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of Stack in Real Life:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CD/DVD stand.\n",
    "- Stack of books in a bookshop.\n",
    "- Undo and Redo mechanism in text editors.\n",
    "- The history of a web browser is stored in the form of a stack.\n",
    "- Call logs, E-mails, and Google photos in any gallery are also stored in the form of a stack.\n",
    "- YouTube downloads and Notifications are also shown in LIFO format (the latest appears first).\n",
