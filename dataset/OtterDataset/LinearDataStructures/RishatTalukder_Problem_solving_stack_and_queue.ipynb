    "`Stack & Queue` are very similar `data structures`. They are both `linear data structures` meaning these `data structures` store the `items` in a `linear fashion` just like `arrays` and `linked lists`. So, as we can implement and solve `stack & queue` problems using `arrays` and `linked lists`, I will discuss the `array` and `linked list` implementation of `stack & queue` in this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with `stack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# <a id='toc3_'></a>[Stack](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_1_'></a>[What is Stack?](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `stack` is a `linear data structure` that stores items in a `Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)` or `First-In/Last-Out (FILO)` manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The `insert` and `delete` operations are often called `push` and `pop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's take an example of a `stack of colored plates`. Assume that you have a stack of plates on your table. The first plate you put on the table is at the bottom, so it will be the last one to be used. The last plate you put on the table is at the top, so it will be the first one to be used. This is exactly how a `stack` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "here is a picture of a `stack`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![stack](https://cdn.buttercms.com/PuR6MmOQQdqAP6xfh6JO)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we start with an `empty stack`. We can `push` items onto the `stack` one by one. Each time we `push` an item, it goes on the `top` of the `stack`. When we `pop` an item off the `stack`, we always `pop` the `top` item. The `stack` is `empty` when there are no items on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we `push` an `item` in the `stack` it's always the last `item` and when we `pop` an `item` from the `stack` it's always the last `item` as well. This is why we call it `Last-In/First-Out (LIFO)` or `First-In/Last-Out (FILO)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `stack` is a `static data structure` that means we have to specify the `size` of the `stack` before using it. But as we are using `arrays` and `linked lists` on `python` to implement `stack` and we can make a `dynamic stack` using `python` `list` and `linked list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: `Stack` is a `abstract data type` and `array` and `linked list` are the `data structures` that we use to implement `stack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Overflow and Underflow\n",
    "\n",
    "`Overflow` condition occurs when we try to `push` an `item` into a `stack` that is `full`. A `stack` may be `full` because of two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Either it is a `fixed size` `stack` and it is `full`.\n",
    "- Or it is a `dynamic size` `stack` and the `system memory` is `full`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "`Underflow` condition occurs when we try to `pop` an `item` from a `stack` that is `empty`. A `stack` may be `empty` because of two reasons:\n",

    "- Or it is a `dynamic size` `stack` and the `system memory` is `empty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, will implement a `dynamic size` `stack` using `python` `list` and `linked list` in this article. So, we don't have to worry about `overflow` and `underflow` conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc3_2_'></a>[Stack Operations](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "A `stack` is an `abstract data type` that supports the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `push`: Adds an `item` to the `stack`. If the `stack` is `full`, then it is said to be an `Overflow condition`.\n",
    "- `pop`: Removes an `item` from the `stack`. The `items` are `popped` in the `reverse order` in which they are `pushed`. If the `stack` is `empty`, then it is said to be an `Underflow condition`.\n",
    "- `peek`: Returns the `top` element of the `stack`.\n",
    "- `isEmpty`: Returns `true` if the `stack` is `empty`, else `false`.\n",
    "- `isFull`: Returns `true` if the `stack` is `full`, else `false`.(Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "- `size`: Returns the `size` of the `stack`. (Not mendaotry for `python` implementation)\n",
    "  \n",
    "## <a id='toc3_3_'></a>[Stack Implementation Using Array(python list)](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement `stack` using `array` in `python` using `list`. We will use `list` `append` and `pop` methods to implement `stack` operations. `append` method will be used to `push` an `item` into the `stack` and `pop` method will be used to `pop` an `item` from the `stack`. `peak` method will be used to get the `top` element of the `stack`, in a list the `last element` is the `top` element of the `stack`. `isEmpty` method will be used to check if the `stack` is `empty` or not, so if the `list` is `empty` then the `stack` is `empty` as well. \n",

    "> Problem Description: Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).\n",

    "> Implement the MyQueue class:\n",
    "> - void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.\n",
    "> - int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.\n",
    "> - int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.\n",
    "> - boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.\n",
    "> Notes:\n",
    "> - You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.\n",
