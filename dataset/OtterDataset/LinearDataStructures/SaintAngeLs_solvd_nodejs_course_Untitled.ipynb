    "## Deep dive into Node.js architecture\n",
    "### 1. What is Node.js?\n",
    "- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.\n",
    "- Historically used primarily in web browsers, Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.\n",
    "- Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts. It's built on the V8 JavaScript runtime and helps in developing scalable network applications.\n",
    "- It's known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is V8?\n",
    "- V8 is a high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google.\n",
    "- Written in C++, it is used in Google Chrome and also provides the runtime environment for Node.js.\n",
    "- V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, instead of using an interpreter.\n",
    "- It implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x86, x64, or ARM processors.\n",
    "- V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application. Its performance focus and continual optimization have played a significant role in the widespread use of JavaScript outside the browser, enabling complex and resource-intensive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is stream?\n",
    "- In Node.js, a stream is an abstraction used for handling the flow of data.\n",
    "- It is an implementation of the EventEmitter class and provides a way to handle reading from or writing to data sources in a continuous manner.\n",
    "- Streams are essential for efficiently managing large volumes of data or data that is received incrementally over time.\n",
    "- They help to minimize memory usage and optimize data processing speed.\n",
    "- There are four main types of streams in Node.js:\n",
    "    - Readable,\n",
    "    - Writable,\n",
    "    - Duplex (both readable and writable),\n",
    "    - Transform (a type of duplex stream that can modify or transform the data as it is read and written).\n",
    "- Streams are widely used in Node.js for tasks such as reading from files, processing HTTP requests, and handling data in real-time applications.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fs = require('fs');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a readable stream\n",
    "const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');\n",
    "readableStream.on('data', function(chunk) {\n",
    "    console.log(`Received ${chunk.length} bytes of data.`);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a writable stream\n",
    "const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');\n",
    "writableStream.write('Hello world!\\n');\n",
    "\n",
    "// Pipe from readable to writable\n",
    "readableStream.pipe(writableStream);\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What V8 streams do you know?\n",
    "- The term 'V8 streams' might be a bit misleading as streams are a part of Node.js, not the V8 engine.\n",
    "- V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js, and it doesn’t provide a streaming data handling mechanism of its own.\n",
    "- Instead, streams in Node.js are implemented on top of the V8 engine's capabilities, utilizing JavaScript's event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model to handle streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What optimization techniques of V8 do you know?\n",
    "- V8 employs several sophisticated optimization techniques to enhance the performance of JavaScript execution.\n",
    "    - One key technique is **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation, where V8 compiles JavaScript to machine code at runtime for faster execution.\n",
    "    - Other techniques include **inline caching**, which speeds up property access by remembering the locations of previously accessed properties, and hidden classes, which optimize object property access.\n",
    "    - V8 also uses an optimizing compiler named TurboFan, which generates efficient machine code for JavaScript.\n",
    "    - Another important aspect is garbage collection, optimized to reclaim memory in an efficient and non-blocking manner.\n",
    "- These optimizations allow V8 to execute JavaScript at speeds comparable to other compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the main idea of demultiplexer pattern?\n",
    "- The demultiplexer pattern, especially relevant in the context of Node.js, is a behavioral design pattern used in event-driven architectures.\n",
    "- It refers to efficiently routing incoming events or data to the correct handler.\n",
    "- This pattern is crucial in handling concurrency in Node.js, allowing a single thread to manage multiple I/O operations.\n",
    "- When an I/O request is initiated, it gets demultiplexed or delegated to the event loop, which then handles the event asynchronously.\n",
    "- Once the operation is complete, the response is routed back to the appropriate callback function.\n",
    "- This pattern enables Node.js to handle a high volume of concurrent operations, despite its single-threaded nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is a non-blocking I/O architecture and how do non-blocking threads work?\n",
    "- Non-blocking I/O architecture is a design where input/output operations do not block the execution of other operations.\n",
    "- In such an architecture, I/O requests are handled asynchronously, allowing a program to continue executing while the I/O operation is being processed in the background.\n",
    "- In the context of Node.js, this is achieved using an event loop and callbacks.\n",
    "- When an I/O request is made, it is sent to the system kernel, and the application continues to execute subsequent code.\n",
    "- Once the I/O operation is complete, the callback function associated with that I/O request is pushed to the event loop to be executed.\n",
    "- This model enables Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently, making it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code example showing the non-blocking threads work w.r.t I/O architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fs = require('fs');\n",
    "\n",
    "fs.readFile('example.txt', (err, data) => {\n",
    "    if (err) throw err;\n",
    "    console.log(data.toString());\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log('Reading file asynchronously');\n",
    "// The program doesn't wait for readFile to complete and moves on to log 'Reading file asynchronously'.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What is libuv?\n",
    "- libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O. It provides the core functionalities of Node.js, including the event loop, and is responsible for handling I/O operations.\n",
    "#### Less briefly:\n",
    "- *Description*:\n",
    "    - libuv is a vital component of Node.js, providing a cross-platform support library focused on asynchronous I/O. It allows Node.js to handle many types of non-blocking I/O operations, including TCP and UDP sockets, file system operations, and DNS queries.\n",
    "    - *Functionality*: libuv implements the event loop and all of Node.js's asynchronous behaviors. It's designed around the reactor pattern, which enables efficient handling of I/O operations.\n",
    "    - *Thread Pool*: libuv also includes a thread pool to handle operations that are either CPU-intensive or cannot be performed non-blockingly on all supported OSes (like file system operations).\n",
    "    - *Cross-Platform*: It abstracts the underlying differences in various OSes, providing a consistent API for Node.js regardless of the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Name all stages of event loop.\n",
    "- The stages of the Node.js event loop are: timers, pending callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks.\n",
    "- Description:\n",
    "    - Timers Phase: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout() and setInterval().\n",
    "    - Pending Callbacks Phase: Handles I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.\n",
    "    - Idle, Prepare Phase: Used internally by Node.js, primarily for preparing upcoming I/O operations.\n",
    "    - Poll Phase: Retrieves new I/O events; Node.js will execute I/O-related callbacks (almost all with the exception of close callbacks, those scheduled by timers, and setImmediate()).\n",
    "    - Check Phase: setImmediate() callbacks are invoked here.\n",
    "    - Close Callbacks Phase: Executes callbacks for some close events, e.g., socket.on('close', ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded?\n",
    "- Node.js is single-threaded for event handling but uses multiple threads in the background (via libuv) for tasks like file and network operations.\n",
    "- *Event Handling*: Node.js, in its core, operates on a single-threaded event loop for handling non-blocking I/O operations, making it lightweight and efficient for certain types of applications.\n",
    "- *Background Processing*: Despite its single-threaded nature, Node.js uses multiple threads in the background, facilitated by libuv's thread pool. This is where operations like file I/O, network operations, or any blocking system calls are executed.\n",
    "- *Worker Threads*: In recent versions, Node.js introduced Worker Threads to enable the execution of JavaScript on multiple threads, providing a way to perform CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the event loop.\n",
    "- *Hybrid Nature*: Therefore, Node.js is essentially a hybrid, using both single-threaded and multi-threaded techniques to optimize performance and resource management.\n"

    "## Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. How errors are handled in JS?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Error handling in JavaScript is primarily achieved using the try...catch statement. The try block contains the code that might throw an error, while the catch block contains the code to execute if an error occurs.\n",
    "- Throwing Errors: Errors can be thrown manually using the throw statement, which creates an exception with a custom error message.\n",
    "- Error Object: The catch block often catches an error object with properties like name and message.\n",
    "- Code Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  // Code that may throw an error\n",
    "  throw new Error('Something went wrong');\n",
    "} catch (error) {\n",
    "  console.error(error.message); // Error handling\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2. What is the purpose of the `finally` block in a try-catch statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functionality: The finally block executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an error was thrown or not.\n",
    "- Use Case: It's typically used for cleaning up resources or code that must run regardless of the outcome (error or no error).\n",
    "- Code Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "try {\n",
    "  // Potentially error-throwing code\n",
    "} catch (error) {\n",
    "  // Error handling\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Big O Complexity of Common Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "- **QuickSort**: \n",
    "  - Average and Best Case: $$O(n \\log n)$$. This is because the array is divided into halves in each step.\n",
    "  - Worst Case: $$O(n^2)$$. This occurs when the pivot selection leads to highly unbalanced partitions.\n",
    "- **MergeSort**: \n",
    "  - Complexity: $$O(n \\log n)$$ for all cases. MergeSort consistently divides the array in half and then merges the sorted halves.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Garbage collection in JavaScript is a form of automatic memory management. The JavaScript engine periodically searches for objects that are no longer in use and frees up their memory.\n",
    "- Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm: Modern JavaScript engines use this algorithm. It marks \"roots\" (global variables and others) and then checks their references, marking those that are reachable. Unreachable objects (those not referenced) are considered for garbage collection.\n",
    "- Code Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",

    "\n",
    "- Description: The heap is a memory area where JavaScript stores objects and function closures. It's essentially an unstructured memory pool for dynamic allocation.\n",
    "- Characteristics: Heap memory is less organized and has no constraints on memory allocation, making it slower compared to stack memory.\n",
    "- \n",
    "### 3. What are the differences between stack and heap memory?\n",
    "- Stack Memory:\n",
    "    - Used for static memory allocation and execution context (like function calls).\n",
    "    - Fast access but limited space.\n",
    "    - Local variables are stored here.\n",
    "- Heap Memory:\n",
    "    - Used for dynamic memory allocation (objects, arrays).\n",
    "    - Slower access but can grow dynamically.\n",
    "Managed via pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What are Map and Set?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map:\n",
    "    - A collection of key-value pairs where keys can be of any type.\n",
    "    - Maintains the order of elements.\n",

    "```javascript\n",
    "let map = new Map();\n",
    "map.set('key', 'value');\n",
    "console.log(map.get('key')); // Outputs 'value'\n",

    "### 5. What is the difference between Map/Set and WeakMap/WeakSet?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map/Set:\n",
    "    - Regular collections with strong references to their elements.\n",
    "    - Not susceptible to garbage collection unless explicitly removed.\n",

    "## OOP and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Name and explain basic principals of OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: This principle states that all data (attributes) and methods (functions or procedures) are bundled into a single unit, called a class. It helps in hiding the internal state of the object from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: This principle involves representing essential features without including background details. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: It is a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class. The new class, known as a derived or child class, inherits attributes and methods from the existing, or base, class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: This principle allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. It is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.\n",
    "- \n",
    "### 2. How to create a class in JS?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In JavaScript, a class can be created using the class keyword. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "  constructor(brand) {\n",
    "    this.carname = brand;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  present() {\n",
    "    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "let myCar = new Car(\"Ford\");\n",
    "console.log(myCar.present()); // Output: I have a Ford\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 3. How does class differ from a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "- Function: A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions are executed when something invokes them (calls them).\n",
    "- \n",
    "### 4. What is a constructor?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A constructor is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class. In JavaScript, the constructor method is called automatically when a new instance of a class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explain the concept of inheritance in JavaScript classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** in JavaScript is achieved using the extends keyword. A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class Model extends Car {\n",
    "  constructor(brand, mod) {\n",
    "    super(brand);\n",
    "    this.model = mod;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  show() {\n",
    "    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "let myModel = new Model(\"Ford\", \"Mustang\");\n",
    "console.log(myModel.show()); // Output: I have a Ford, it is a Mustang\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the Model class inherits from the Car class. The super(brand) call passes the brand to the constructor of the parent (Car) class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Where we can reach private and protected fields?\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript (and thus in Node.js), private and protected fields are implemented using closures or the newer # syntax introduced in ES6 for classes. Private fields can be accessed within the class they are defined in but not outside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    #privateField;\n",
    "\n",
    "    constructor() {\n",
    "        this.#privateField = 'Private Value';\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    showPrivateField() {\n",
    "        console.log(this.#privateField); // Accessible within the class\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "const myInstance = new MyClass();\n",
    "myInstance.showPrivateField(); // This works\n",
    "console.log(myInstance.#privateField); // Syntax Error: Private f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What are static methods and fields?\n",
    "\n",
    "Static methods and fields are tied to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. This means you can call a static method or access a static field without creating an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "    static staticField = 'Static Value';\n",
    "\n",
    "    static staticMethod() {\n",
    "        console.log('This is a static method.');\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(MyClass.staticField); // Access static field without an instance\n",
    "MyClass.staticMethod(); // Call static method without an instance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What are mixins?\n",
    "A mixin is a way to create classes that include functionality from multiple sources (or classes). This is a form of composition where you can combine simpler classes or objects to create a more complex one. JavaScript doesn’t support multiple inheritance, but mixins provide a way to get around that limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let sayMixin = {\n",
    "    say(phrase) {\n",

    "const myInstance = new MyClass();\n",
    "myInstance.say(\"Hello\"); // Hello\n",
    "myInstance.sing(\"La la la\"); // La la la\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Data Structures and Abstract Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is an Array and What Methods Does It Have?\n",
    "- **Description**: An array is a linear data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an array index.\n",
    "- **Key Methods**:\n",
    "  - `push()`: Adds an element to the end.\n",
    "  - `pop()`: Removes the last element.\n",
    "  - `shift()`: Removes the first element.\n",
    "  - `unshift()`: Adds an element to the beginning.\n",
    "  - `slice()`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.\n",
    "  - `splice()`: Changes the contents of the array by removing or replacing existing elements.\n",
    "  - `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`: Iteration methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is a Stack and What Methods Does It Have?\n",
    "- **Description**: A stack is an abstract data type (ADT) that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element (peak is quite the same but it is not removing the element from the top of the stack but only returns what is the key it has).\n",
    "- **Key Methods**:\n",
    "  - `push()`: Adds an element to the stack.\n",
    "  - `pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack.\n",
    "  - `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is a Queue and What Methods Does It Have?\n",
    "- **Description**: A queue is an abstract data type that operates in a first-in, first-out manner. It has two main operations: enqueue (addition) and dequeue (removal).\n",
    "- **Key Methods**:\n",
    "  - `enqueue()`: Adds an element to the end of the queue.\n",
    "  - `dequeue()`: Removes the first element from the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is a Linked List?\n",
    "- **Description**: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object linked using pointers. Each element (node) contains data and a reference (link of the pointer in the more object oriented languages) to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is a Graph?\n",
    "- **Description**: A graph $G := (V, E, f = null)$ is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect these nodes and the poptional function defining the weights each of the edge has. Graphs can be used to represent various real-world relationships (bipartite 4-regular graph as the some sort of the molecules relations in the Carbon chain), such as social networks or geographical maps. (Also here it will be optional to tell about some of the graph problems: NP finding the hamiltonian cicle in the connected graph, Algorithm Dijksta's and Belman-Ford's)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is a Hash Table?\n",
    "- **Description**: A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found.\n",
    "- Example of the hash map in Node.js\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Using JavaScript Object\n",
    "const hashtable = {};\n",
    "hashtable[\"key1\"] = \"value1\";\n",
    "hashtable[\"key2\"] = \"value2\";\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(hashtable[\"key1\"]); // Outputs: value1\n",
    "\n",
    "// Using JavaScript Map\n",
    "const map = new Map();\n",
    "map.set(\"key1\", \"value1\");\n",
    "map.set(\"key2\", \"value2\");\n",
    "\n",
    "console.log(map.get(\"key1\")); // Outputs: value1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures\n",
    "- **Abstract Data Types (ADT)**: An ADT is a mathematical model for data types, where a data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a user of the data(it does not provide the specific implementation of the method specific DS contains).\n",
    "- **Data Structures**: A data structure is a specific implementation of an ADT in a programming language providing the specification of the way the method DS contatins implementation. It not only stores data but also supports various operations on the data that are allowed by the ADT.\n"

    "## Fundamentals of Web Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is HTTP and how does it work?\n",
    "- **Description**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.\n",
    "- **How It Works**: It works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A client, usually a web browser, sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server then responds with an HTTP response.\n",
    "- **Node.js Example**:\n",
    "  ```javascript\n",
    "  const http = require('http');\n",
    "\n",
    "  http.createServer((req, res) => {\n",
    "    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n",
    "    res.end('Hello World\\n');\n",
    "  }).listen(8080);\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Name and describe main REST principals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statelessness**: No client context is stored on the server between requests.\n",
    "- **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between client and server.\n",
    "- **Uniform Interface**: Consistent and standardized communication interface.\n",
    "- **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not.\n",
    "- **Layered System**: Client cannot tell whether it is connected to the end server or an intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Name and describe main HTTP methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.\n",
    "- **POST**: Send data to a server to create/update a resource.\n",
    "- **PUT**: Update a resource on the server.\n",
    "- **DELETE**: Delete a resource from the server.\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "const express = require('express');\n",
    "const app = express();\n",
    "\n",
    "app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('GET request'));\n",
    "app.post('/', (req, res) => res.send('POST request'));\n",
    "app.put('/', (req, res) => res.send('PUT request'));\n",
    "app.delete('/', (req, res) => res.send('DELETE request'));\n",
    "\n",
    "app.listen(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 PUT vs POST\n",
    "- PUT\n",
    "    - **Idempotence**: PUT is an idempotent method. This means that making multiple identical PUT requests has the same effect as making a single request.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Typically used for updating resources. If a resource doesn't exist at the specified URL, PUT might create a new resource, depending on the server's implementation.\n",
    "    - **Example**: If you send a PUT request to update a user's details and send the same request again, the second request will have no additional effect. The user's details will remain as set by the first PUT request.\n",
    "- POST\n",
    "    - **Non-Idempotent**: POST is not idempotent. Each POST request can potentially lead to a different outcome.\n",
    "    - **Use Case**: Generally used for creating new resources. When you send a POST request, you expect the server to create a new resource or trigger some other process.\n",
    "    - **Example**: If you send a POST request to create a new user and then send the exact same POST request again, you will likely end up with two users with identical data.\n",
    "- **What Happens After Sending PUT Twice?**\n",
    "When you send a PUT request twice with the same data to the same URI, the second request doesn't change anything that wasn't already established by the first request. The resource state after both requests will be the same.\n",
    "- **Example Scenario (Node.js)**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// PUT request example\n",
    "app.put('/updateUser/:id', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  // Idempotent: Updating user data\n",
    "  updateUser(req.params.id, req.body); // Updates user data\n",
    "  res.send('User updated');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "// POST request example\n",
    "app.post('/createUser', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  // Non-idempotent: Creating a new user\n",
    "  createUser(req.body); // Creates a new user\n",
    "  res.send('User created');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the updateUser function will set the user's data each time it's called, but the end result is the same regardless of how many times the PUT request is made with the same data. In contrast, each POST request to createUser could potentially result in a new user being added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What application levels do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and communication layer.\n",
    "- **Business Logic Layer**: Data processing and decision making.\n",
    "- **Data Access Layer**: Storage and retrieval of data.\n",
    "- **Data Layer**: Actual database or data storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How does JWT auth work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.\n",
    "- Working: The server generates a token that certifies the user identity and sends it to the client. The client will send the token back with every subsequent request.\n",
    "- Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\n",
    "const token = jwt.sign({ user: 'username' }, 'secret_key');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. How does OAuth2 work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OAuth2**: An authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.\n",
    "- **Flow**: It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.\n",
    "- **Grant Types**: Authorization Code, Implicit, Resource Owner Credentials, Client Credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. How to send data to server?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be sent to a server using various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, or - DELETE.\n",
    "In a POST request, data is included in the body of the request.\n",
    "Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const express = require('express');\n",
    "const app = express();\n",
    "app.use(express.json()); // For parsing application/json\n",
    "\n",
    "app.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(req.body); // Data sent in the request body\n",
    "  res.send('Data received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "app.listen(3000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- GET Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Used for requesting data from a specific resource.\n",
    "    - Data is sent in the URL's query string.\n",
    "    - Suitable for simple queries but has size limitations.\n",
    "    - Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// GET request with query parameters\n",
    "app.get('/data', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(req.query); // Data is in the query string\n",
    "  res.send('GET Data received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- POST Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Used to send data to a server to create a resource.\n",
    "    - The data is included in the body of the request.\n",

    "    - Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// POST request with JSON body\n",
    "app.post('/data', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(req.body); // Data is in the request body\n",
    "  res.send('POST Data received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- PUT Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Used to send data to a server to update an existing resource.\n",
    "    - Data is included in the body of the request.\n",
    "    - Idempotent: Repeated requests have the same effect.\n",
    "    - Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// PUT request for updating a resource\n",
    "app.put('/data/:id', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(`Updating resource with id ${req.params.id}`);\n",
    "  console.log(req.body);\n",
    "  res.send('PUT Data received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- DELETE Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Used to delete a resource on the server.\n",
    "    - Can send data in the query string or in the request body (less common).\n",
    "    - Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// DELETE request with query parameters\n",
    "app.delete('/data', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(`Deleting resource with query: `, req.query);\n",
    "  res.send('DELETE request received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "- PATCH Method (Not Mentioned Earlier):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Used for sending partial updates to a resource.\n",
    "    - Similar to PUT, but only updates the specified fields.\n",
    "    - Node.js Example:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// PATCH request for partial update\n",
    "app.patch('/data/:id', (req, res) => {\n",
    "  console.log(`Partial update for resource id ${req.params.id}`);\n",
    "  console.log(req.body);\n",
    "  res.send('PATCH Data received');\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additional Considerations:\n",
    "    - Headers: When sending data, especially in POST, PUT, and PATCH requests, it's important to set the appropriate Content-Type header (like application/json for JSON data).\n",
    "    - Body Parsing: In Express.js, express.json() and express.urlencoded() middleware are used to parse incoming requests with JSON payloads and URL-encoded payloads, respectively."

    "- **Key Features**: \n",
    "  - Middleware support for request processing.\n",
    "  - Routing capabilities to manage different HTTP requests at different URLs.\n",
    "- **Node.js Example**:\n",

    "  \n",
    "### 2. What’s the difference between framework and library?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Library**:\n",
    "    - A collection of functions and tools that can be used by other programs.\n",
    "    - The calling code is in charge, and it calls the library where it needs.\n",
    "    - Examples: Lodash, jQuery.\n",
    "- **Framework**:\n",
    "    - Provides a skeleton or blueprint for applications.\n",

    "    - Example: Express, Angular.\n",
    "### 3. How does express middlewares work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality**: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.\n",
    "- Purpose: They can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware.\n",
    "- Node.js Example:\n",

    "### 1. What types of DBs do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Stores data in tables with relationships between them (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).\n",
    "- **NoSQL Databases**:\n",
    "    - **Document-Oriented**: Stores data as documents (e.g., MongoDB).\n",
    "    - **Key-Value Stores**: Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).\n",
    "    - **Wide-Column Stores**: Stores data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns (e.g., Cassandra).\n",
    "    - **Graph Databases**: Stores data in nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is a relational DB?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.\n",
    "- It organizes data into tables which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is normalization and what normal forms exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization**: The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.\n",
    "- **Normal Forms**:\n",
    "    - **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Eliminates duplicate columns from the same table.\n",
    "    - **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: Ensures that all non-key columns are dependent on the table’s primary key.\n",
    "    - **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Removes transitive dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. What is denormalization and why do we need it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Denormalization**: The process of combining tables or adding redundant data to speed up complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: To improve read performance by reducing the number of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How are SQL commands classified?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Commands that define the structure (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).\n",
    "- **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Commands that manipulate data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\n",
    "- **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Commands related to access control (GRANT, REVOKE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Name and describe types of relations between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**One-to-One**: Each row in Table A is linked to one (and only one) row in Table B.\n",
    "- **One-to-Many**: A row in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B.\n",
    "- **Many-to-Many**: Rows in Table A can be related to many rows in Table B and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. How many-to-many relation can be proceeded?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handled through a junction table that contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of each data table.\n",
    "- \n",
    "### 8. Why do we need constrains and which do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Rules enforced on data columns to maintain data integrity.\n",
    "- **Types**: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN` and `OUTER JOIN`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "- **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table.\n",
    "- **FULL (OUTER) JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. How does `CROSS JOIN` work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produces the Cartesian product of two tables – combines each row of the first table with each row of the second table.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 11. How to combine two selects in SQL query? (what operator is needed for this)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Done using UNION operator, which combines the results of two SELECT queries into a single result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. What are aliases and why do we need them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aliases are used to give a temporary name to a table or column for the duration of a query.\n",
    "- Improves readability and allows for more concise queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What is an index?\n",
    "\n",
    "- An index in a database is used to speed up the retrieval of data from a table. It's like an index in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. What is a document-oriented DB?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stores data as documents (often in JSON format) rather than traditional tables and rows. Example: MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. What are key-value DBs used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal for storing and retrieving large volumes of data characterized by a key. Used in caching, sessions, and real-time recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. What is ORM?\n",
    "\n",
    "A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. It creates a \"virtual object database.\""

    "# Models of Development\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. How does the Waterfall Model work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. In this model, the development process is divided into distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Requirements Analysis**\n",
    "- **System Design**\n",
    "- **Implementation**\n",
    "- **Integration and Testing**\n",
    "- **Deployment**\n",
    "- **Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin. There is typically no overlapping or iterative process in the Waterfall model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How does the Agile Model work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Unlike the Waterfall model, Agile focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases. The main principles include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools\n",
    "- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation\n",
    "- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation\n",
    "- **Responding to change** over following a plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, are widely used under this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the main idea of the V-Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The V-Model, also known as the Verification and Validation model, is an extension of the Waterfall model. Instead of moving down in a linear way, the process steps are bent upwards after the coding phase, forming a V shape. The main stages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Requirements Analysis**\n",
    "- **System Design**\n",
    "- **Implementation**\n",
    "- **Verification**\n",
    "- **Maintenance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage on the left-hand (downward) side of the V corresponds to a testing phase on the right-hand (upward) side.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Difference between Incremental Model and Iterative Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incremental Model**: This model involves delivering a system in increments or pieces. Each increment provides part of the desired functionality. It’s like building a product step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative Model**: This model focuses on an initial, simplified implementation, which then progressively gains more complexity and a broader feature set until the final system is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. How does SCRUM work?\n",
    "\n",
    "SCRUM is an Agile development methodology used primarily for managing software development projects. It organizes work into small, manageable pieces that can be completed by a cross-functional team within a prescribed time period called a sprint, usually two to four weeks long.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daily Stand-Up Meetings**: Short meetings to discuss progress.\n",
    "- **Sprints**: Time-boxed intervals when a specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.\n",
    "- **Sprint Review**: Discussing what was completed and what wasn't.\n",
    "- **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflecting on the past sprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. SCRUM Roles and Responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product Owner**: Defines the features of the product and decides on release date and content.\n",
    "- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process and resolves impediments at the team and organization level.\n",
    "- **Development Team**: Cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. How does Kanban work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is a popular Agile framework that visualizes the work process. The main components of Kanban include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual Boards**: These are used to visualize the flow of work.\n",
    "- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits**: Limits are set on the number of tasks in different stages of the process.\n",
    "- **Continuous Flow**: Work moves through the Kanban board and is continuously delivered.\n",
