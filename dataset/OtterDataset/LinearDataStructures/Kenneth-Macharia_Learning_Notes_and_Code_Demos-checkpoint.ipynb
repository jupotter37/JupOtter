    "\n",
    "- Data structures and algorithms is a study area of the theoretical computer science field in the discipline of computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An algorithm is a proceedure or fomula for solving a problem.\n",
    "- Big-O notation: a notation that compares algorithm based on how fast they run and how much memory (space) they use  to run, independent of hardware. It examines how **quickly an algorithm's runtime grows** (not exact runtimes) relative to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large, also known as the algorithm's complexity.\n",
    "- An algorithm's complexity can either be time (above) or space (amount of resource it uses in computing a result)\n",
    "- Time complexity can be determined by evaluating the number of assignmnents/ operations an algorithm makes relative to the input size.\n",
    "- Big-O uses the 'n' notation to represent input size, so that various input sizes can be used to analyze the alogrithm's growth.\n",
    "- As n becomes arbitrarily large, the concern is only on the terms that grow the fastest relative to n thus constants are not conisdered in big-O notation analysis.\n",
    "- Big-O is analysis is considered asymptotic (describing limiting behaviour) i.e a function f(n + 1) may considered asymptotically equal to to another f(n) as the value of n becomes arbitrarily large or as the limit is approached.\n",
    "- See function algo_analysis below for Big O breakdown demo.\n",
    "- Common Big-O notations/ functions that can be used to evaluate an algorithm are:\n",
    "    \n",
    "  1. Constant time O(1): the computation time does not grow when the input size grows.\n",
    "  2. Logarithmic O(Log n):the computation time scales half as much relative to the size of the input\n",
    "  3. Linear time O(n): the computation time scales linearly with the input size.\n",
    "  4. Log Linear time O(nlog n): Combines the log & linear time complexities and is more efficient than the below          ones.\n",
    "  5. Polynomial time O(n^c) : these grow c times the size of the input, where c is a constant and c > 1. They include      quadratic O(n^2) & cubic O(n^3) time complexities.\n",
    "  6. Exponential time O(2^n): As opposed to polynomial time where the input is multiplied c times, exponential time\n",
    "     involves multiplying a constant base input number of times.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Examples of implementation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1592649/examples-of-algorithms-which-has-o1-on-log-   n-and-olog-n-complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Best case vs Worst case scenarios: Usually the worst case is considered in Big O analysis but consideration for the\n",
    "  best case is also important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space complexity: how much memory different algorithms take in order to execute. Consider the trade offs of \n",
    "  different algoriths for both time and space complexities."

    "- Array sequences in Python: Lists, Tuples and Strings, which all support indexing and index-based assignment and are\n",
    "  referencial arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A) Low level arrays & computer architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Data is stored in memory in form of byte(8 bits)\n",
    "  - Computers use unique consequtive memory addresses to refer to each byte e.g. byte #2144 or byte #2147\n",
    "  - Computer memory is designed so that any byte can be accessed efficiently e.g constant time thus the name RAM.\n",
    "  - Programming languages keep an association between an identifier e.g varible name and the memory address for           value stored in memory.\n",
    "  - A group of related variables can be stored in a contiguous (neighbours) portion of memory, which can be deonted       as an array.\n",
    "  - A text string is stored an an ordered sequence of unicode characters.\n",
    "  - Python stores each character using 16bits (2 btyes). Thus \"SAMPLE\" would take 12 consequtive bytes of memory         each with a unique address.\n",
    "  - Each loacation within an array(2bytes always) is a cell, which uses an index to describe its location.\n",
    "  - Memory addresses used to find any item in memory can then be computed in constant time to find any location by       using the formula: end address (desired cell start address) = start address (of an array) + (cellsize)(index).\n",
    "  \n",
    "B) Referential Arrays (High level abstraction): \n",
    "\n",
    "- Using arrays to represent any number of strings but to ensure access to any of them is done efficiently i.e           constant time, then each cell of the array must have the same number of bytes, and in python for characters its 2.\n",
    "- The solution is not to have arrays of the characters (objects) themselves rather have arrays of references to the     objects stored in memory, and each of the array cells will have 2 bytes.\n",
    "- Python stores arrays in this manner as object references and as such all array operations involve creating or         changing references to objects, often a list may contain multiple references to the same object and an object may     be referenced by multiple lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    " - List slicing results to a new list but referencing/pointing the same old objects in the original list.\n",
    " - Re-assignment: e.g of a list items to another list will result in the new list pointing to the old list items. If    one of the cells of the new items is assigned a different value not in the original list, then a new object is        created away from the two list and the cell pointed to that new object.\n",
    " - Shallow copies ie. backup = list(primes), duplicates the previous object's reference list, thus if the objects are    mutable, changing the object reference from the new list, will change the old list references as well.\n",
    " - Deep copies: if the object are mutable, you can create a new list with new references using the deepcopy function,    thus the two list will now be independent.\n",
    " - counter = [0]*8 means create a list of 8 cells all with zeros, but this actually creates one integer object and a    list counter with 8 cells all referencecing the one object. counter [2] +=1, will create a new object as per the      operation and change the reference of cell [2] to the new object.\\\n",
    " - primes.extend(extras), means that references to the objects referenced by the extras list are added to the end of    the primes reference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) Dynamic arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python you dont need to specify the array size when creating one. Python already holds some memory, usually abit   larger than is curently needed and as the list grows, it will grab more memory in stages and again abit more that     it needs at that point in time. See demo below.\n",
    "- Theoretical implementation of a dynamic array: beginning with the first-sized array (A), create a second array (B)   twice the size of the orginal one. Create reference in array B to point to the objects currently in array A, then     reassign reference of array A to array B and garbage collect the memory previously used by array A, so now we have   new array A with all the object references as before but with additional memory space."

    "### Amortized Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is an algorithm design pattern, useful when performing a series of operations such that we break even in terms of the operations' costs, combined. By using this approach we can then 'pay' for an expensive operation by preceeding it with a number of cheap operations and accumulating their savings to use use on the upcoming expensive operation.\n",
    "- The motivation for this approach is that taking the worst-case for such operations can be too pesimistic and as such a more realistic approach is preferred, that looks at the actual operations' costs and cost bounds e.g time/operations.\n",
    "- So rather than having one sort operation for an array, look at a series of sorts, look-ups, deletes to a database and strive to make them efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The amortized cost per operation of a sequence of n operations is their total cost / n\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if we have 100 operations at cost 1, followed by one operation at cost 100, the amortized cost per operation is 200/101 < 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The reason for considering amortized cost is that we will be interested in data structures that occasionally can incur a large cost as they perform some kind of rebalancing or improvement of their internal state, but where such operations cannot occur too frequently. In this case, amortized analysis can give a much tighter bound on the true cost of using the data structure than a standard worst-case-per-operation bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A Potential function is a function of the state of a system, that generally should be non-negative and start at zero and is used to smooth out the anaylysis of some algorithm or process.\n",
    "- The potential fucntion is like a bank acoout where we put the savings from the cheap operations to use on the expensive functions when needed and for purposes of this model, it should never be negative otherwise the model fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: implementing a stack as an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to use an array to implement a stack. We have an array A, with a variable top that points to the top of the stack (so A[top] is the next free cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "• To implement push(x), we just need to perform: A[top] = x; top++;\n",
    "• To implement x=pop(), we just need to perform: top--; x = A[top]; (first checking to see if top==0 of course..)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if the array is full and we need to push a new element on?\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case we can allocate a new larger array, copy the old one over, and then go on from there. This is going to be an expensive operation, so a push that requires us to do this is going to cost a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "But maybe we can “amortize” the cost over the previous cheap operations that got us to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, on average over the sequence of operations, we’re not paying too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, let us define the following cost model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost model: \n",
    "Let’s say that inserting into the array costs 1, taking an element out of the array\n",
    "costs 1, and the cost of resizing the array is the number of elements moved. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Say that all other operations, like incrementing or decrementing “top”, are free.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1: What if when we resize we just increase the size by 1? Is that a good idea?\n",
    "Answer 1: Not really. If our n operations consist of n pushes then we will incur a total cost\n",
    "1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2. That’s an amortized cost of (n + 1)/2 per operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 2: What if we instead decide to double the size of the array when we resize?\n",
    "Answer 2: This is much better. Now, in any sequence of n operations, the total cost for resizing is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2i for some 2i < n (if all operations are pushes then 2i will be the largest power of 2 less than n). \n",
    "\n",
    "This sum is at most 2n − 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding in the additional cost of n for inserting/removing, we get a total cost < 3n, and so our amortized cost per operation is < 3.\n"

    "- In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. \n",
    "- Memoization has also been used in other contexts (and for purposes other than speed gains), such as in simple mutually recursive descent parsing. \n",
    "- Although related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as buffering or page replacement. \n",
    "- In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as tabling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "- A memoized function \"remembers\" the results corresponding to some set of specific inputs. Subsequent calls with remembered inputs return the remembered result rather than recalculating it, thus eliminating the primary cost of a call with given parameters from all but the first call made to the function with those parameters.\n",
    "- A function can only be memoized if it is referentially transparent; that is, only if calling the function has exactly the same effect as replacing that function call with its return value.\n",
    "- Memoization is a way to lower a function's time cost in exchange for space cost; that is, memoized functions become optimized for speed in exchange for a higher use of computer memory space.\n",
    "- For every integer n such that n≥0, the final result of a factorial function is invariant; if invoked as x = factorial(3), the result is such that x will always be assigned the value 6. \n",
    "- The non-memoized implementation above, given the nature of the recursive algorithm involved, would require n + 1 invocations of factorial to arrive at a result, and each of these invocations, in turn, has an associated cost in the time it takes the function to return the value computed:\n",
    "\n",

    "    5. The cost to multiply the result of the recursive call to factorial by n.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- In a memoized function, if factorial is first invoked with 5, and then invoked later with any value less than or equal to five, those return values will also have been memoized, since factorial will have been called recursively with the values 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0, and the return values for each of those will have been stored. - If it is then called with a number greater than 5, such as 7, only 2 recursive calls will be made (7 and 6), and the value for 5! will have been stored from the previous call. In this way, memoization allows a function to become more time-efficient the more often it is called, thus resulting in eventual overall speed up.\n",

    "- A priority queue is an implementation of a queue, with the distinction that enqueing an item will position it   anywhere in the priority queue based on its priority key rather than enqueing at the back.\n",
    "- Highest priority items are positioned at the front of the queue based on the priority criteria.\n",
    "- Priority queues are implemented using a Binary heap data structure, which allows for enqueing and dequeuing in order O(Log n).\n",
    "- A binary heap is defined as a binary tree with the additional properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Shape property: a binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly         the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of         that level are filled from left to right.\n",
    "    - Heap property: the key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to (≥) or less than or equal to       (≤) the keys in the node's children, according to some total order (transitive relation between the keys).\n",
    "    - Heaps where the parent key is greater than or equal to (≥) the child keys are called max-heaps; those where       it is less than or equal to (≤) are called min-heaps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Efficient (logarithmic time) algorithms are known for the two operations needed to implement a priority queue on a binary heap: inserting an element, and removing the smallest or largest element from a min-heap or max-heap, respectively.\n",
    "- Binary heaps are also commonly employed in the heapsort sorting algorithm, which is an in-place algorithm because binary heaps can be implemented as an implicit data structure (using little info to describe its structure), storing keys in an array and using their relative positions within that array to represent child-parent relationships.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Priority queues implementation using binary heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A min heap: where the smallest key has the highest priority i.e positioned at the front.\n",
    "    - A max heap: where the largest key has the highest priority i.e positioned at the front.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To ensure efficiency in implementing a binary heap, we need to keep it balanced like in a tree i.e:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Have roughly the same number of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the root (a complete binary tree)\n",
    "    - Each level, that is not the final, should have all it's node.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- A complete binary heap can be represented using an array implicitly, without nodes and pointers, using the relation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If a parent node is at index i\n",
    "    - Then the left child will be at index 2i, and\n",
