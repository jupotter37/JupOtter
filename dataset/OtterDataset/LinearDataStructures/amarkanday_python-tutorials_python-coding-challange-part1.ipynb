    "### Linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a fundamental data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each containing a value and a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. In this tutorial, we will cover how to implement a simple singly linked list in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node**: Each element in a linked list is called a node. It typically contains two components: the data (value) and a pointer to the next node.\n",
    "- **Head**: The first node in a linked list is called the head.\n",
    "- **Tail**: The last node points to `None`, indicating the end of the list.\n",

    "\n",
    "    # Search for an element\n",
    "    print(\"Search for 2:\", linked_list.search(2))  # Output: True\n",
    "    print(\"Search for 4:\", linked_list.search(4))  # Output: False\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Explanation of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion**:\n",
    "  - A new node is created and added to the end of the list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deletion**:\n",
    "  - The list is traversed to find the node to delete. If it is found, the previous node `next` pointer is updated to skip the deleted node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search**:\n",
    "  - The list is traversed to find a node with a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Display**:\n",
    "  - The entire list is printed by traversing from the head to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Python, demonstrating how to create a linked list, insert and delete nodes, search for a value, and display the list. Linked lists are a versatile data structure, useful in various applications like implementing stacks, queues, and more complex data structures. You can extend this implementation by adding more features, such as inserting at specific positions, reversing the list, or implementing a doubly linked list for bidirectional traversal."

    "  print(f\"'{string2}' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome(string2)}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Explanation:* This function first converts the input string to lowercase to handle palindromes with uppercase letters. Then, it uses slicing (`[::-1]`) to create a reversed copy of the string and compares it with the original. If they match, the string is a palindrome.\n",

    "  print(f\"Fibonacci sequence ({num_terms} terms): {fibonacci(num_terms)}\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Explanation:* This function starts with a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1). It then iterates from the third term up to `n`, calculating each subsequent number by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence.\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Explanation:* This function uses recursion to calculate the factorial. The base case is when `n` is 0, in which case it returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1`.\n",

    "  else:\n",
    "      print(f\"Target {target_value} not found in the list\")\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  *Explanation:* This function iterates through the list `arr` and checks each element against the `target`. If a match is found, it returns the index of that element. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns -1.\n",

    "  *Explanation:* Binary search works on sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half. If the middle element is the target, it returns the index. If the target is smaller, it searches in the left half; otherwise, it searches in the right half.\n",
