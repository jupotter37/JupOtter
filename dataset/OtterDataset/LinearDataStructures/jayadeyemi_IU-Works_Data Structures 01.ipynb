    "### **Problem description: Implementing a Skip-List Data Structure:**\n",
    "        A Skip List is a probablistic data structure that allows for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations. It is built upon multiple levels of linked lists, where each level is a subset of the previous level. The efficiency of a skip list comes from its ability to skip over some nodes, thus reducing the number of steps required to find an element.\n",

Amortized constant time per operation over a sequence of operations.\n",

Logarithmic to linear, depending on the distribution of elements across the levels.\n",

    "        During some programming operations, the presence of cycles within a linked list is observed, this leads to issues in its processing. Given an linked list, your task is to determine if a cycle exists and, if so, to break the cycle. The function cycle_buster(node) should be implemented to return the head of the modified linked list with the cycle removed, if present.\n",
