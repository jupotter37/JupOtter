        "Since we've now covered the Hash Table, and since you now have experience with the basics of how a Linked List is implemented, the goal of this homework is to **bring these two pieces of your knowledge together** by showing how:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. \"Naïve\" Hash Tables, until they are **paired** with some minimally-efficient method for handling **collisions**, are not very useful on their own (Part 1)\n",
        "2. However, since we now know about Linked Lists, we can **use a Linked List structure within our Hash Table implementation** to achieve an actually-useful (non-naïve) Hash Table achieving $O(1 + \\epsilon n)$ runtime (Part 2)\n",
        "3. Once you've seen how these two can be put together, we'll look at a **simple modification** we can make to the Linked List structure to create a **Binary Search Tree** structure, which can store and retrieve elements in $O(\\log_2(n))$ time, faster than the $O(n)$ runtime of the Linked List (Part 3)\n",
        "4. Then, once we've seen this Binary Search Tree Structure, we can return to our Hash Tables from Part 2 and **replace the Linked List structure being used to handle collisions** with a **Binary Search Tree structure instead**, to transform the Hash Table's runtime from $O(1 + \\epsilon n)$ to $O(1 + \\epsilon \\log_2(n))$ (Part 4)\n",
        "5. Finally, we will make one simple modification to our LogarithmicHashTable, using the first **two** letters of each key as the hash code (instead of just the first letter), which will bring us yet closer to full-on $O(1)$ time. This improvement illustrates how, by increasing the **memory** allocated for the fixed-length array in our hash table, we can get **arbitrarily close** to $O(1)$! (Part 5)"

        "Of all the parts on this assignment, this is the only one where you'll be making a structure that you would **not** want to use in real life! It's incredibly important for learning, however, since\n",
        "\n",
        "* (a) we'll see why a hash table **on its own**---that is, without any reasonably-efficient way to handle **collisions**---is not really a data structure at all (since it **loses information** that was previously added to it). However,\n",

        "First things first, however, we'll need a **hash function** which can take the **keys** we want to store in our hash table and deterministically derive a **slot** in our fixed-length array where a given key should be stored. To achieve this, run the following cell, which creates an `AlphaHasher` class that we'll use to hash `str` values. Specifically, this class will compute the hash value for a `str` as the **index in the alphabet** of the **first letter of the string**:\n",

        "\n",
        "Note that, in Part 5, we'll switch from using `AlphaHasher` to using a new `DoubleAlphaHasher` class to hash based on the first **two** letters of the string, rather than just the first letter. While we'll stick to the pattern of having both `AlphaHasher` and `DoubleAlphaHasher` classes for now, since there are only two different versions, you can imagine how it could be helpful to **change the design pattern** we're using, to allow users to **specify** how many letters to use for hashing: rather than creating separate classes `AlphaHasher`, `DoubleAlphaHasher`, `TripleAlphaHasher`, etc., we could just create a single `NAlphaHasher` class which would allow users to specify how many letters of the string they want the hashing to use!"

        "\n",
        "In the following cell, build on the provided starter code to create a working `NaiveHashTable` class. Each of the bullet points here represents an element of this class that your code should implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__init__(self) -> None`. This **constructor** function should take only the required `self` argument, but will also perform the following initialization steps, which are already written for you:\n",
        "  * Create an **instance variable** called `fixed_length_array`, whose value should be initialized to an **empty NumPy array** object with size `26` (for the 26 \"slots\" in the English alphabet). Specifically, we create this empty array using NumPy's <a href='https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.empty.html' target='_blank'>`np.empty()` function</a>.\n",
        "  * Create an **instance variable** called `num_added`, initialized to the `int` value `0` (this will be incremented each time the `add()` function runs)\n",
        "  * Create an **instance variable** called `num_collisions`, initialized to the `int` value `0` (this will be incremented each time the `add()` function encounters a collision)\n",
        "* `add(key: str, value: object) -> bool`\n",
        "\n",
        "  This function should:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Create a variable called `data` and assign the tuple `(key, value)` as its value,\n",
        "  2. **Use the `hash()` function from `AlphaHasher`** to **hash** the value of the `key` argument, storing this hashed value (which will be of type `int`) into a variable called `key_hash`. However, here you will need to be careful and include a **check** to determine whether or not the variable `key` is in fact a **string**. If `key` is an **instance of** the `str` type, then your code can safely call `hash(key)` without issue. If it is not, however, your function should **not** try to call `hash(key)`, and should instead just return the `bool` value `False`. Thus, users of your `NaiveHashTable` class will know that if the `add()` function returned `False` it means the `key` they provided was **not hashable** given our `AlphaHasher` setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Note how we *can* (and should!) include a `str` **type hint** for the `key` argument in the specification of `add()` above, but since Python does not **enforce** type hints, we still ask you to perform this check within the `add()` function. The rationale for this is: if you are developing **for yourself** or in a **small team**, you can either (a) trust yourself and your teammates to look at and never violate the type hints, **or** (b) set up your personal/team development environment so that it **runs a type-checker like MyPy** on each `.py`/`.ipynb` file before running it. For larger collaborative projects, however (for example, the many popular open-source projects with hundreds of contributors on GitHub), it will almost **never** be the case that they run MyPy before running Python code, sadly!\n",
        "  3. If the function did not return `False` during the previous step, and we were able to successfully compute a hash value for `key`, then store the `(key, value)` tuple (the value assigned to the variable `data` in Step 1) in the specific \"slot\" within `base_array` with index `key_hash`. For example: if the value of `key_hash` is `0`, store the tuple as the **first** element of `self.fixed_length_array`; if the value of `key_hash` is `1`, store the tuple as the **second** element of `fixed_length_array`; and so on. However, here you will need to be careful to **check whether there was a collision or not!** If the previous value in the slot **was not `None`**, then there has been a **collision**, so that you should **increment the `self.num_collisions` instance variable** before you replace the previous value in the slot with the new value!\n",
        "  4. Once the slot within `self.fixed_length_array` has been updated, make sure to also **increment the `self.num_added` instance variable**. By tracking the number of collisions at the end of Step 3, and tracking the number of items added in this step, the `compute_collision_rate()` function described below should only require 1 or 2 lines of code!\n",
        "* `get_item_at_index(self, index: int) -> object`\n",
        "  * This function should just return whatever happens to be stored in slot `index` of the `fixed_length_array` instance variable. So, `get_item_at_index(0)` should return `self.fixed_length_array[0]`, `get_item_at_index(1)` should return `self.fixed_length_array[1]`, and so on. You should implement this **before** using `to_string()`, however, since `to_string()` uses this function to **display the entries within each slot of `self.fixed_length_array`**.\n",
        "* `__len__(self) -> int`\n",
        "  * This function should just return the number of **slots** within `self.fixed_length_array` that contain non-`None` values. In other words, it should return the number of **\"filled\" slots** in the hash table. Note that this is **not the same as `num_added`**!! This is important to notice here since, it's precisely why our `NaiveHashTable` is not a usable data structure (yet): when the `add()` function encounters a **collision**, the previously-stored value is **thrown out** and replaced by a new value. This means that, for example, the user may have added 20 items to the `NaiveHashTable`, but `__len__()` may only return `16`, indicating that there were **4 collisions** among the 20 calls to `add()`!\n",
        "* `compute_collision_rate(self) -> float`\n",
        "  * This function should use the `num_added` and `num_collisions` instance variables to compute the **collision rate** for the `NaiveHashTable` object. If **no items have been added yet** (i.e., if the `NaiveHashTable` object is empty), this function should just return the `float` value `0.0`. However, as long as the object has one or more entries, this function should return the **ratio** of the **number of collisions** to the **number of successful calls to `add()`** (there are two instance variables you defined in the constructor which will help you here 😜)\n",
        "* `__str__(self) -> str` and `__repr__() -> str`\n",
        "  * The starter code defines an **instance method** for you, within the `NaiveHashTable` class, called `to_string()`. Your `NaiveHashTable` should implement both the `__str__()` and `__repr__()` functions, but all that these two functions need to do is simply **return the result of calling `self.to_string()`**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The `to_string()` function here allows us to straightforwardly visualize the contents of our `NaiveHashTable`: it will always produce exactly 26 lines, where each line corresponds to a \"slot\" in our `fixed_length_array`, showing the alphabetical letter that hashes to the slot and then the value stored in that slot. For example, if we've added the three datapoints `('Aardvark', 10)`, `('Popsicle', 20)`, and `('Coconut', 30)` in a `NaiveHashTable` object `naive_ht`, then `naive_ht.to_string()` will produce the following output:\n",

So, if you can get comfortable with this polymorphic structure now, you'll eliminate the need for **two** if statements within every function of the `BinarySearchTree` class, **four** if statements within every function of the `QuadTree` class, and so on!"

        "Now that the `LinkedList` class is defined, we can use it as a \"black box\" within our `LinearHashTable` class! In the following cell, implement this `LinearHashTable` class, by writing the following functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `__init__(self)`: Just like in Part 1, the constructor for `LinearHashTable` should just initialize an instance variable called `fixed_length_array`, as a NumPy array with length 26. It should also initialize, as in the `NaiveHashTable` class, instance variables called `num_added` and `num_collisions`, both of which should be assigned the `int` value `0`.\n",
        "* `add(self, key: str, value: object) -> bool`: Now that we're moving from a **Naïve** Hash Table to a **Linear** Hash Table, your `add()` function will become a bit more involved: it will need to check whether `key` is indeed a variable of type `str`, returning the `bool` value `False` if it is not, and then it will hash the `key` object as before. However, after computing this hash value for `key`, you will need to handle three possible cases:\n",
        "  * **[Case 1] `key` hashes to empty slot**: If the entry at index `key_hash` of `self.fixed_length_array` is just the value `None`, you just need to update this entry to now be a `tuple` object `(key, value)`.\n",
        "  * **[Case 2] `key` hashes to a slot containing a single `tuple` object**: If the entry at index `key_hash` of `self.fixed_length_array` is a `tuple` object (meaning, something was hashed into this slot before, triggering [Case 1], and thus we now have a first **collision** at this slot), then you will need to (a) store the existing `tuple` object into a Python variable (so it is not lost in this conversion), (b) construct a new `LinkedList` object for storing the two datapoints that have now been hashed to the same slot (and any further values that may hash to this same slot, handled in [Case 3]), (c) add the `tuple` object that was originally in this slot as the **first** item in the `LinkedList` you just created, and (d) add a new tuple `(key, value)` containing the data currently being added (the arguments to the `add()` function) as the **second** item in this newly-constructed `LinkedList`.\n",
        "  * **[Case 3] `key` hashes to a slot containing a `LinkedList` object**: If the entry at index `key_hash` of `self.fixed_length_array` is a `LinkedList` object (meaning, two or more keys have already previously hashed into this same slot), you just need to create a tuple object `(key, value)` containing the data currently being added (the arguments to the `add()` function), and append this tuple object as the **next item** within the existing `LinkedList` object.\n",
        "* `find_item_steps(self, key: str)`: The code for this function has already been provided for you, but I wanted to include it here because it will be important to understand, since it's what we will use to measure the **efficiency** of our hash table, in this and future parts of the assignment. This function uses the `AlphaHasher` class to compute the hash value `key_hash` for the `key` argument, then returns different values given three different possible cases:\n",
        "  * **[Case 1] The content at index `key_hash` is just the value `None`**: This means that an entry with key `key` does not exist in the hash table (since, if it did, that entry would have hashed to the slot `key_hash`, and thus this slot would not contain `None`), so to indicate that we only had to do this one computational step (checking the value in slot `key_hash`) to discover that the entry does not exist, we return the `int` value `1`\n",
        "  * **[Case 2] The content at index `key_hash` is a `tuple` object**: This means that only one entry has ever hashed into this slot, so we've either (a) found the item with key `key`, if the first element of the tuple is equal to `key`, or (b) discovered that the item does not exist in the hash table, if the first element of the tuple is not equal to `key`. Therefore, in either case we've only performed **one** computational step, so we return the `int` value `1`.\n",
        "  * **[Case 2] The content at index `key_hash` is a `LinkedList` object**: In this case we \"forward\" the function to the `LinkedList` class, by just returning the value produced as a result of calling the `find_item_steps()` function on the `LinkedList` object at index `key_hash`. This function is implemented within the `LinkedList` class provided for you above, and computes how many \"hops\" were required before finding the node corresponding to the desired `key` value.\n",
        "* `entry_to_string(self, index: int, recurse: bool) -> object`: You need to complete this function, but it just asks you to return whatever value is stored within the instance variable `self.fixed_length_array` at slot `index`. In other words, you **do not need to do any hashing for this function**: whereas the other functions have an argument like `key` (indicating a value that should be hashed for insertion/retrieval into the hash table), this function just needs to directly go to the slot `index` and return its value. So, we have the following (hopefully) straightforward cases, where [Case 3] is the only one requiring an additional consideration:\n",
        "  * **[Case 1] The entry at slot `index` is `None`**: In this case, the function should return the value `None`\n",
        "  * **[Case 2] The entry at slot `index` is a `tuple` object**: In this case, the function should just return this `tuple` object.\n",
        "  * **[Case 3] The entry at slot `index` is a `LinkedList`**: This is the case you need to be careful about, because it's where the `recurse` argument comes in. The `LinkedList` class provided for you above has a `to_string()` function defined, which takes in a single argument called `recurse`, and prints **all** contents of the list if the provided `recurse` value is `True`, or just the **first** item in the list if the provided `recurse` value is `False`. Your code here, therefore, just needs to return the value which is produced by calling the `to_string()` function on the `LinkedList` object stored in the slot `index`, with the `recurse` value as its only argument. This ensures that, for example, if `entry_to_string()` was called with a `recurse` value of `True` and the entry in slot `index` is a `LinkedList` object, the full contents of this `LinkedList` object will be produced.\n",
        "* `__len__(self) -> int`: Notice the two underscores before and after the name of this function: this indicates that it is a **special** function used by Python to implement some operator, in this case the `len()` operator.  So, your job in implementing this function is to return an `int` value representing the total number of elements stored in the hash table. Note that, **unlike the case for the `NaiveHashTable`**, here you cannot simply count the number of empty vs. non-empty slots! Instead, any time you encounter a slot in the `self.fixed_length_array` instance variable that contains a `LinkedList` object, you will need to use the `len()` operator (which we know will \"work\", since `__len__()` is defined within the provided `LinkedList` class above) to find its length. Given this, hopefully it makes sense that the final length of the **entire `LinearHashTable`** will be the sum of:\n",
        "  * `0` for all slots containing just the \"blank\" value `None`\n",
        "  * `1` for all slots containing a single `tuple` object, and\n",
        "  * `len(self.fixed_length_array[i])` for all slots `i` containing a `LinkedList` object.\n",
        "* `__str__()` and `__repr__()`: As before, you do need to implement these functions, but they should just work as follows:\n",
        "  * `__str__()` should return the value of `self.to_string()`, called with the `recurse` argument set to be the `bool` value `False`\n",
        "  * `__repr__()` should return the value of `self.to_string()`, called with the `recurse` argument set to be the `bool` value `True`\n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing `__str__()` and `__repr__()` this way, we can see our first real example of using these two functions for two different purposes:\n",
        "* We use `__str__()` to generate a **simplified** string representation of the `LinearHashTable` object, where we only see the first element of any slots containing `LinkedList` objects, but then\n",
        "* We use `__repr__()` to generate an **expanded** (i.e., more detailed) string representation of the `LinearHashTable` object, where we see **all** of the elements stored within any slots containing `LinkedList` objects."

        "  * This function should take in `item`, which (as indicated by the type hint) should be an object of type `InventoryItem`, so that we can be sure that the items added to our tree have a defined **ordering**. However, since Python does not enforce type hints, your code should **explicitly check** whether or not `item` is an instance of the `InventoryItem` type, and return the `bool` value `False` if it is not. Once you've ensured that `item` is indeed an object of type `InventoryItem`, this function should proceed by just setting the `root` instance variable to point to a new `BSTNode` object (this will involve calling the `BSTNode` constructor, described below) containing the passed-in `InventoryItem` object `item`.\n",
        "  * Also note that the function in `LinkedList` was called **`append()`**, while this function is instead called **`add()`**. This is because, we're no longer \"appending\" when we add items to a binary search tree, since there's no single \"end\" that we can add a new item \"after\".\n",

        "  * This function should require significantly fewer lines of code than the `add()` function! As was the case with the `LinearHashTable` above, the job of this function is just to return the number of computational steps required to find the `InventoryItem` object `item` within the binary search tree.\n",
        "* `__repr__()` and `__str__()`: You need to define these functions, but as you've done thus far, they should just work as follows:\n",

Here, however (within the `BinarySearchTree` class), you don't need to perform this manual check of the type of `item`.\n",

Otherwise, we'll need to return the sum of:\n",
        "  * `1`, representing the check we did of the `BSTNode`'s content, and then\n",
        "  * `0` if `item` **precedes** this `BSTNode`'s content but this `BSTNode` has no left child,\n",
        "  * The result of `left.find_item_steps()` if `item` **precedes** this `BSTNode`'s content and this `BSTNode` **does** have a left child,\n",

You can just use Python operators like `<`, `==`, and `>` to check whether you've found `item`, and if not, whether the search should continue within the **left** or **right subtrees** of the `BSTNode`."

But, it also may suddenly dawn on you: when we were working with LinkedLists, we could print all the contents by just \"looping through\" the list, from one element to the next, printing as we go along. But... for a BinarySearchTree, since our structure can now **branch** as we traverse it... How do we \"loop through\" a BST?\n",

The two methods are:\n",

Since both concepts invoke the notion of **\"moving\"** through a tree, **animations** can illustrate the two far better than any static, textual description can, in my view.

Store this mean number of operations into a Python variable called `two_letter_efficiency`: you should find that the mean number of operations is now about **half** of the mean number of operations we achieved with `AlphaHasher` at the end of the previous part!\n",

So, you can now imagine how we can get arbitrarily close to $O(1)$: the hash table is exactly the data structure which illustrates the **efficiency-memory tradeoff** mentioned in the first week of class, in the sense that, we can make it more and more efficient---without any algorithmic changes---simply by allocating more and more memory to the base hash table algorithm."
