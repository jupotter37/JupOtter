    "Initial Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem of finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique with the help of a hash set (or a dictionary). The sliding window approach allows us to maintain a dynamic range of characters while iterating through the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understanding the Problem: We need to identify substrings within the given string where no character is repeated. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and the goal is to find the maximum length of such substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a Sliding Window: By maintaining a window of characters and expanding it until we encounter a duplicate character, we can track the length of the substring dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash Set for Character Tracking: A hash set (or dictionary) is used to quickly check for the existence of a character and to efficiently manage the characters within the current window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation of the Code Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    char_set: A hash set is used to track the characters currently in the window.\n",
    "    left: This pointer indicates the start of the sliding window.\n",
    "    max_length: This variable stores the length of the longest substring found without repeating characters.\n",
    "Iterating through the String:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A for loop iterates through each character in the string with right as the right pointer of the sliding window.\n",
    "    If the character at s[right] is already in char_set, it indicates a duplicate. We enter the while loop to shrink the window from the left until the character can be added without duplication.\n",
    "Shrinking the Window:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside the while loop, characters from the left are removed from the set until s[right] can be added. The left pointer is incremented accordingly.\n",
    "Updating the Set and Maximum Length:\n",
    "\n",
    "    After ensuring that the character is unique within the window, we add s[right] to the char_set.\n",
    "    We update max_length with the maximum value between the current max_length and the current window size, which is calculated as right - left + 1.\n",
    "Returning the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, the function returns max_length, which contains the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and potentially once by the left pointer).\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The space complexity is O(min(n,m)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., 128 for ASCII). In the worst case, the size of the set could be equal to the number of unique characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: If the input string is empty, the function should return 0 as there are no characters to form a substring.\n",
    "    All Unique Characters: If all characters in the string are unique, the length of the longest substring will be equal to the length of the string itself.\n",
    "    All Same Characters: If the string consists of the same character (e.g., \"aaaa\"), the longest substring will have a length of 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "How would you modify this approach if you also needed to return the substring itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You could maintain the starting index of the longest substring found and slice the original string after the loop ends to return the substring alongside its length.\n",
    "What if the input string could include Unicode characters?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The approach remains the same, but you may need to handle the character set differently based on the encoding of the input string.\n",
    "Could you solve this problem using a different approach, such as dynamic programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "    While it’s possible to solve this using dynamic programming, the sliding window approach is typically more efficient for this problem due to its linear time complexity."

    "    If the stack is not empty, it means there’s a matching (, so we pop the stack (indicating a valid pair).\n",
    "    If the stack is empty, it means there’s no matching (, so we add the index of this ) to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    After finishing the loop, any indices left in the stack correspond to unmatched (. We add those indices to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create an empty list called result to hold valid characters.\n",
    "    We iterate through the original string again:\n",
    "    For each character, we check if its index is in the to_remove set. If it’s not, we append the character to result.\n",

    "    Mixed Characters: Input \"a)(b(c)d)\" → Output \"ab(c)d\" (removes unmatched parentheses).\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once to identify invalid parentheses and once to build the result.\n",

    "        To avoid using the same cell more than once, mark the cell as visited by replacing its value temporarily (e.g., changing it to a special character) and then backtrack to restore it.\n",
    "    Explore Adjacent Cells: Recursively call the backtracking function for all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n",

    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(m * n * 4^L), where L is the length of the word. The reasoning is that in the worst case, for each cell (m*n), we could explore up to 4 directions for every character in the word.\n",

    "How would you modify this solution for a doubly circular linked list?\n",
    "\n",
    "    We would need to add a previous pointer in the node structure and adjust the insertion logic to update both next and previous pointers accordingly. The traversal would also need to account for the backward movement.\n",

    "    Given the need to maintain sorted order during insertion, the time complexity of O(n) is optimal for this problem. However, if we had an additional data structure (like a balanced binary search tree) to maintain order, we could achieve better average search times for larger datasets, at the cost of additional complexity in insertion and deletion."

    "    1 <= s.length <= 1000\n",
    "    s consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The task is to find the number of palindromic substrings in a given string s. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. Each character in the string is a palindromic substring by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    Expand Around Center: Since palindromic substrings can be centered around each character or between two characters, we can use an approach to \"expand around each center\" to count palindromic substrings.\n",
    "    Centering on Each Position: For each character and each pair of consecutive characters in the string, expand outwards while the substring remains a palindrome.\n",
    "    Efficiency: This method avoids generating all substrings directly and is efficient in terms of time complexity.\n",

    "        Center at a (index 2): expands to \"a\" (1 palindrome).\n",
    "    Two Character Centers:\n",

    "Steps\n",

    "    Define the main function that will loop through each cell in the grid.\n",
    "    If a cell contains '1', increment the island count and invoke a DFS or BFS function to mark the entire island.\n",

    "    Ensure that we don't go out of bounds and only mark cells that are '1'.\n",

    "    We start at cell (0, 0). It's a '1', so we have found our first island. We increment the count to 1.\n",

    "        (0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (0, 3)\n",
    "        Move down to (1, 0) and mark (1, 1) as visited.\n",
    "    After visiting all connected land, we end up with the entire island marked as '0's.\n",

    "        The problem requires finding the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of a grid, where only rightward and downward movements are allowed. The challenge lies in optimizing the path to ensure the sum of the values along the path is minimized.\n",
    "    Dynamic Programming Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "        A dynamic programming (DP) approach is suitable here because the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems (calculating minimum paths to each cell). By storing intermediate results (minimum path sums to each cell), we can avoid redundant calculations and efficiently build up to the final solution.\n",
    "    State Representation:\n",

    "    Filling the First Column:\n",

    "    Dynamic Programming for Remaining Cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "        The third nested loop iterates through the rest of the grid, starting from cell (1, 1). For each cell grid[i][j], the code adds the minimum of the two possible previous cells (up and left) to its current value:\n",

    "    Identify Constraints and Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "        We need an  O(n) time complexity solution.\n",
    "        We are limited to  O(1) auxiliary space, which suggests we cannot use additional data structures like hash sets or arrays.\n",
    "        The problem is about finding the smallest positive integer missing from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Range of Possible Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Since the smallest missing positive integer must be within the range  [1,n+1] (where n is the length of nums), values like negatives or numbers greater than n are irrelevant for identifying the missing integer.\n",
    "        This observation means we only care about values from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling Values in a Limited Range Efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Given the limited range we care about, we can leverage the array itself as a way to “mark” the presence of values.\n",

    "    In-Place Rearrangement Using Swaps:\n",
