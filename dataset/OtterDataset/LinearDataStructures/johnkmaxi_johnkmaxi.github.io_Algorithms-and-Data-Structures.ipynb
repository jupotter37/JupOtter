    "Creating and returning the output only happen one time, no matter how long the input message is. So we would write O(2). We also have a for loop that does two things. That will add 2n computations as the input message gets longer. Now we have O(2n+2). This tells us that if the input message is 10 letters long, our program will require 22 computations to decode it. If the input message is 2 million letters long, will take 2 million and 2 computations. Of course, it is really not that simple! Consider that we haven't given any credit to the computations occuring when the for loop is called. We have also assumed that each line in the for loop is not calling other computations in the background. For instance, the ciper holds the mappings from input to output for each letter in the alphabet. Each time we call this line, the program has to go through the whole ciper, looking for the mapping for the current letter. If we take these other processes into account we have O((2+1+26)n+2) = O(29n+2). (Where 1 is the computation for calling the for loop, and 26 is the number of mappings to check in the ciper data structure). Now if the message length is 10, we need 292 computations amd if the message length is 1 million, we need 29 million computations. In practice, instead of making these detailed calculations for all our code, we present big O notation as a \"worst case scenario\". For this decode function, we would simplify from O(29n+2) to O(n) to say that computation time scales linearly with input length. In this case, O(n) really means \"Some number of computations must be performed for EACH letter in the message.\" Here are some more examples:"

The reason is that in the background, Python actually implements its list data type as an array! Inserting an obejct into a list in Python takes O(n) time, while searching for an item in a Python list takes O(1) time. More details on the time complexity of Python lists is available [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity).\n",
