This comes at a total of (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + … + 2 + 1 = n(n-1)/2 comparisons, which can also be written as ½$n^2$ - ½n.\n",

    "In cases where the algorithm receives an array that’s already sorted—and assuming the implementation includes the already_sorted flag optimization explained before—the runtime complexity will come down to a much better O(n) because the algorithm will not need to visit any element more than once.\n",

    "Why does the implementation above select the pivot element randomly? Wouldn’t it be the same to consistently select the first or last element of the input list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how the Quicksort algorithm works, the number of recursion levels depends on where pivot ends up in each partition. In the best-case scenario, the algorithm consistently picks the median element as the pivot. That would make each generated subproblem exactly half the size of the previous problem, leading to at most $\\boldsymbol{log_2n}$ levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the algorithm consistently picks either the smallest or largest element of the array as the pivot, then the generated partitions will be as unequal as possible, leading to n-1 recursion levels. That would be the worst-case scenario for Quicksort.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Quicksort’s efficiency often depends on the pivot selection. If the input array is unsorted, then using the first or last element as the pivot will work the same as a random element. But if the input array is sorted or almost sorted, using the first or last element as the pivot could lead to a worst-case scenario. Selecting the pivot at random makes it more likely Quicksort will select a value closer to the median and finish faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option for selecting the pivot is to find the median value of the array and force the algorithm to use it as the pivot. This can be done in O(n) time. Although the process is little bit more involved, using the median value as the pivot for Quicksort guarantees you will have the best-case Big O scenario.\n"

    "With Quicksort, the input list is partitioned in linear time, O(n), and this process repeats recursively an average of $\\boldsymbol{log_2n}$ times. This leads to a final complexity of $\\boldsymbol{O(n log_2n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, remember the discussion about how the selection of the pivot affects the runtime of the algorithm. The O(n) best-case scenario happens when the selected pivot is close to the median of the array, and an O($n^2$) scenario happens when the pivot is the smallest or largest value of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, if the algorithm focuses first on finding the median value and then uses it as the pivot element, then the worst-case complexity will come down to $\\boldsymbol{O(n log_2n)}$. The median of an array can be found in linear time, and using it as the pivot guarantees the Quicksort portion of the code will perform in $\\boldsymbol{O(n log_2n)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the median value as the pivot, you end up with a final runtime of O(n) + $\\boldsymbol{O(n log_2n)}$. You can simplify this down to $\\boldsymbol{O(n log_2n)}$ because the logarithmic portion grows much faster than the linear portion."

    "One of Quicksort’s main disadvantages is the lack of a guarantee that it will achieve the average runtime complexity. Although worst-case scenarios are rare, certain applications can’t afford to risk poor performance, so they opt for algorithms that stay within O(n log2n) regardless of the input.\n",
