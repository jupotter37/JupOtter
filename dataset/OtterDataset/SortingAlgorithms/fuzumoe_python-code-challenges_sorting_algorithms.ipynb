    "# Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** are two fundamental algorithms used to traverse or search through graphs and trees. They explore nodes in different orders and are used for various purposes, such as finding paths, connected components, and shortest paths in unweighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "- **BFS** explores a graph layer by layer, starting from a given node (source). It visits all the neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of neighbors.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. Start from the source node.\n",
    "  2. Visit all the neighboring nodes (nodes directly connected to the source).\n",
    "  3. Mark them as visited and add them to a queue.\n",
    "  4. Remove the first node from the queue and repeat the process for its neighbors.\n",
    "  5. Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases:**\n",
    "  - Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n",
    "  - Checking if a graph is connected.\n",
    "  - Level-order traversal in trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Graph:\n",
    "      A\n",
    "     / \\\n",
    "    B   C\n",
    "   /|   |\\\n",
    "  D E   F G\n",
    "\n",
    "  BFS Order (starting from A): A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "- **DFS** explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It goes deep into the graph starting from the source node, visiting a neighbor, then a neighbor of that neighbor, and so on, until reaching a node with no unvisited neighbors.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1. Start from the source node.\n",
    "  2. Visit an unvisited neighbor and move to it.\n",
    "  3. Repeat the process for the new node until there are no unvisited neighbors.\n",
    "  4. Backtrack to the last visited node with unvisited neighbors and continue the process.\n",
    "  5. Repeat until all nodes have been visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases:**\n",
    "  - Checking for cycles in a graph.\n",
    "  - Topological sorting in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).\n",
    "  - Solving puzzles like mazes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Graph:\n",
    "      A\n",
    "     / \\\n",
    "    B   C\n",
    "   /|   |\\\n",
    "  D E   F G\n",
    "\n",
    "  DFS Order (starting from A): A -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F -> G\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences:\n",
    "- **BFS** uses a queue (FIFO) for tracking the next node to visit, while **DFS** uses a stack (LIFO), either explicitly or through recursion.\n",
    "- **BFS** explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving deeper, while **DFS** goes deep first before exploring siblings.\n",
    "- **BFS** is better for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, while **DFS** is suitable for scenarios where the solution requires exploring all possible paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both algorithms are essential for understanding graph theory and can be adapted for solving a variety of computational problems.\n"

    "- The algorithm picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.\n",
    "- There are many different versions of quick sort that pick pivot in different ways:\n",

    "  - Always pick the last element as a pivot.\n",
    "  - Pick a random element as a pivot.\n",
