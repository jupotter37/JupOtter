    "This algorithm works by iterating through both arrays, comparing elements between the arrays and writing the smallest to an output array. We start by comparing the first elements in each array and writing the smallest to the output array. Then, we compare the second element of the array which had the smaller first element to the first element in the other array and write the smallest to the output array. We repeat this process, moving one step through the array which had the smaller element in the last step until one of the arrays is exhausted. Then, we append the rest of the non-exhausted array to the output array and return it.\n",

For $n = k + 1$, `mergesort` splits the input array into two arrays with length at most $\\left \\lceil \\frac{k+1}{2} \\right \\rceil < k$, since $k+1 \\geq 3$. Since both arrays have length less than k, `mergesort` sorts them correctly by assumption and as we are assuming `merge` also works (i.e. it returns a sorted array consisting of the elements of two sorted input arrays), we have that `mergesort` works for $k+1$\n",

    "Both sorting algorithms use a recursive divide and conquer strategy, where `mergesort` splits the input in half, but `quicksort ` can split the array in any ratio. In the worst case scenario, `mergesort`, which is $O(n\\log n)$, is more efficient than `quicksort`, which is $O(n^2)$. There are ways to make `quicksort` more efficient, for example by taking the pivot to be the median of the elements of the input array. This then makes `quicksort` $O(n\\log n)$, so on par with `mergesort`. In terms of space complexity, `quicksort` is more efficient because it works \"in-place\" whereas `mergesort` stores its output in an external array because the `merge` function must store its output in a 3rd array separate from either input array."
