    "You will create a simple program to search and sort information about the first 151 pokemon. \n",

    "You have been provided with a JSON file called `pokedex.json`, simply open the file to use it.  \n",
    "This is how the data looks:\n",

    "The program will have the following features:\n",
    "- Search for a pokemon by its name, partial name is allowed too (Example 'pika' should find 'Pikachu').\n",
    "- Sort the pokemon by stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed ). and display the top 10 pokemon.\n",
    "- Filter the pokemon by type (Example 'grass' should display all grass type pokemon).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use the `json` library for this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following tasks:\n",
    "- Import the `json` library and load the `pokedex.json` file.\n",
    "- Create the `find_pokemon_by_name` function that searches for a pokemon by its name (partial name search is allowed).\n",
    "- Create the `sort_pokemon_by_stat` function that sorts the pokemon by a given stat and displays top 10.\n",
    "- Create the `filter_pokemon_by_type` function that filters the pokemon by a given type.\n",
    "- Create the `main` function that does the following.\n",
    "  - Ask the user if they want to search, sort, filter or quit.\n",
    "  - Call the appropriate function based on the user's choice.\n",
    "  - Ask the user for the name, stat or type based on the choice.\n",
    "  - Display the results.\n",
    "  - Repeat until the user quits.\n",
