    "* The `bubbleSort()` function takes an array as input\n",

    "* The inner loop (`for j in range(0, len(array) - i - 1)`) performs the pairwise comparisons and swaps\n",

    "## 4.2. Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that relies on the divide and conquer approach, a common strategy used in algorithm design. The divide and conquer methodology involves solving problems in three main steps:\n",
    "1. *Divide*: Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n",
    "2. *Conquer*: Solve the sub-problems individually, often through recursion.\n",
    "3. *Combine*: Combine the solutions to the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Quick Sort, this process is carried out as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Select any element from the unsorted list as a pivot element.\n",
    "> There are various ways to select a pivot element: first element, last element, or any random element.\n",
    "1. Divide the unsorted list into three distinct parts: one for elements smaller than the pivot, one for elements equal to the pivot, and one for elements larger than the pivot.\n",
    "> The smaller sublist is placed to the left of the pivot, and the larger sublist is placed to the right. Elements equal to the pivot are already in their correct sorted order. Note that the smaller and larger sublists are not necessarily sorted at this stage.\n",
    "2. Using recursion, repeat step 1 for the smaller and larger sublists.\n",
    "> This process continues until the sublists are small enough, typically having a length of 1 or 0, that sorting becomes trivial.\n",
    "3. Once the recursive process is complete, combine the sorted sublists to get the full sorted array.\n",
