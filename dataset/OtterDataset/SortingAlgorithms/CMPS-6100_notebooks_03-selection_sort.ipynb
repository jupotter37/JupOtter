Just as before, we know that $a_2'$ is the second smallest element in the list, except now we know that the smallest element is already in the first position. Therefore we can find the second smallest element in as the smallest element in the list from the second position to the end. Once we find it, swap it into position.\n",

To put it succincly, for every position, we select the element that belongs there and swap it into place. This algorithm is called **Selection Sort**."
