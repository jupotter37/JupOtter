    "\n",
    "1. Base Case:\n",
    "   - If the length of the input array arr is less than or equal to 1, the function returns the array as is.\n",
    "   - This is the base case for the recursion.\n",
    "   - The time complexity for this part is constant, denoted as O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Partitioning:\n",
    "   - The algorithm selects a pivot element (in this case, the middle element of the array).\n",
    "   - It then partitions the array into three subarrays:\n",
    "     - `left`: Contains elements less than the pivot.\n",
    "     - `middle`: Contains elements equal to the pivot.\n",
    "     - `right`: Contains elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "   - The partitioning step takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursion:\n",
    "   - The function recursively calls itself on the `left` and `right` subarrays.\n",
    "   - The recurrence relation for the time complexity is:\n",
    "     T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)\n",
    "     (Two recursive calls on subarrays of size n/2 and linear work for partitioning)\n",
    "   - By applying the Master Theorem, we find that the time complexity of the recursive part is O(n \\log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combining Results:\n",
    "   - The final result is obtained by concatenating the sorted `left`, `middle`, and `right` subarrays.\n",
    "   - The concatenation step takes O(n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overall Time Complexity:\n",
    "   - Combining all the steps, the overall time complexity of the quicksort algorithm is:\n",
    "     T(n) = O(n) + O(n \\log n) + O(n) = O(n \\log n)\n",
    "\n",
