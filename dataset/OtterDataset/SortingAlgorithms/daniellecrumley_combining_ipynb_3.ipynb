    "Each .ipynb notebook is JSON.\n",
    "Make a list of the names of the notebooks you want to merge (they should be in the same folder where this notebook is).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, load the content of each file into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I use the first notebook as my template and add the cells of the other notebooks to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, first I encourage you to study the structure of an .ipynb a little.  Download a program called ATOM and open the .ipynb file with it.  Examine it and determine what makes a .ipynb notebook.  You will quickly realize what you need to load from the subsequent notebooks and add to your template.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your edited template is ready you can write the JSON as a new .ipynb and you are done!  This will create a compiled .ipynb.\n",

    "After loading an .ipynb file (i.e. a = json.load(f)), `a` is in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `a` is a **dictionary**, whose keys are `'cells'`, `'metadata'`, `'nbformat'`, `'nbformat_minor'`]\n",
    "\n",
    "* `a['cells']` is a **list of dictionaries**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `a['cells'][0]` is a **dictionary containing information about the first cell in a jupyter notebook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The information for each cell in a Jupyter notebook is in `a['cells']` and the rest is general jupyter notebook formatting and metadata. Below, I have loaded the first notebook into the variable `a`. Then, for each subsequent notebook, I added just the `cells` information to the variable `a`. "
