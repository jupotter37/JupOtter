    "## Introduction to Heap Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place it at the end of the array. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient for sorting large data sets.\n",
    "- In-place sorting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not a stable sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap Sort is useful in applications where constant time retrieval of the maximum or minimum is needed, like priority queues."

    "- In a **Max-Heap**, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to its children.\n",
