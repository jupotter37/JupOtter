        "\n",
        "Big-O notation helps to measure the time complexity (performance) or space complexity (memory usage) of an algorithm, which is crucial in determining how an algorithm scales with larger input sizes.\n",
        "For example, in JavaScript, as in any other programming language, Big-O notation is applied by analyzing the behavior of the code as input increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, I explain how you can apply Big-O notation in JavaScript:\n",
        "1. **Analyze the Code's Time Complexity:**\n",
        "Check how the time taken by the code increases as the size of the input increases. You can do this by counting how many times the operations (loops, recursions, etc.) run for different inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Identify Common Time Complexities:**\n",
        "- **O(1): Constant time -** The algorithm's runtime is independent of the input size.\n",
        "- **O(n): Linear time -** The runtime grows linearly with input size.\n",
        "- **O(n²): Quadratic time -** Nested loops that iterate over the input lead to this.\n",
        "- **O(log n): Logarithmic time -** Algorithms that divide the problem space in half each time (e.g., binary search).\n",
        "- **O(n log n): Log-linear time -** This complexity often appears in more efficient sorting algorithms, like merge sort or quicksort.\n",
        "3. **Big-O Example with Code**\n",
        "- Below are examples of how different time complexities manifest in JavaScript code:\n",
        "\n",
