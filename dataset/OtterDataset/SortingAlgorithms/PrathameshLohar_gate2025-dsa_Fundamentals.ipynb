    "**Graph Theory** is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Graphs are widely used in computer science, biology, social sciences, and many other fields to represent networks, systems, and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **What is a Graph?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **graph** is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (also called arcs) that connect pairs of nodes. Formally, a graph \\( G \\) is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ G = (V, E) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( V \\) is the set of **vertices** (or nodes).\n",
    "- \\( E \\) is the set of **edges** (or links), which are pairs of vertices that are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Types of Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undirected Graph**: In an undirected graph, the edges have no direction. That is, if there is an edge between vertices \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), it can be traversed in both directions. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: \\( (u, v) \\) is the same as \\( (v, u) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: In a directed graph, each edge has a direction. An edge from vertex \\( u \\) to vertex \\( v \\) is distinct from an edge from vertex \\( v \\) to vertex \\( u \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: \\( (u, v) \\neq (v, u) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Graph**: A weighted graph assigns a weight (or cost) to each edge, representing the cost or distance between two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: An edge between vertex \\( u \\) and vertex \\( v \\) might have a weight of 5, which indicates that the cost of traveling from \\( u \\) to \\( v \\) is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unweighted Graph**: In an unweighted graph, all edges are considered equal, and no specific cost is assigned to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete Graph**: A complete graph is one in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bipartite Graph**: A bipartite graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree**: A tree is a type of graph that has no cycles and is connected. A tree with \\( n \\) vertices always has \\( n-1 \\) edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subgraph**: A subgraph is a graph formed from a subset of the vertices and edges of another graph.\n",

    "- **Vertex (Node)**: A fundamental unit in a graph, represented as a point or dot.\n",
    "- **Edge (Arc)**: A connection between two vertices, often represented as a line between the vertices.\n",
    "- **Degree of a Vertex**: The number of edges incident to a vertex. In a directed graph, it is divided into:\n",
    "  - **In-degree**: The number of incoming edges.\n",
    "  - **Out-degree**: The number of outgoing edges.\n",
    "- **Path**: A sequence of edges that connect a sequence of vertices.\n",
    "- **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges or vertices (except the starting/ending vertex).\n",
    "- **Connected Graph**: A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. In a directed graph, this means there must be a directed path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "- **Component**: A connected subgraph of a graph. A graph can have multiple disconnected components.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several ways to represent graphs in computer memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where each element \\( matrix[i][j] \\) represents the presence (and weight, if applicable) of an edge between vertex \\( i \\) and vertex \\( j \\). For an undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric.\n",
    "  \n",

    "  0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "  \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: An array of lists, where each index of the array corresponds to a vertex, and each element in the list is a vertex that is connected to it by an edge. This representation is more space-efficient than the adjacency matrix, especially for sparse graphs.\n",

    "  Example (unweighted undirected graph):\n",

    "- **Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms**: Find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph, which is a subset of the edges that connects all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.\n",

    "- **Topological Sorting**: A linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge \\( u \\to v \\), vertex \\( u \\) comes before \\( v \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hamiltonian Path/Cycle**: A path that visits each vertex exactly once (Hamiltonian path) or a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex (Hamiltonian cycle).\n",

    "\n",
    "Graph theory has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as:\n",
