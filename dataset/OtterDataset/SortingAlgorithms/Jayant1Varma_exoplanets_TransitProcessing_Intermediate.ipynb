        "To date, the transit method is the most successful and powerful method of finding exoplanets. A transit occurs when an exoplanet orbiting a distant star passes directly between the earth and the star, causing some of the incoming light from the star to be blocked by the planet. By monitoring the brightness of stars and looking for periodic dips in intensity, you can confirm whether an exoplanet is orbiting the star. With a single transit you can then apply the transit equation to determine the planet's radius. With multiple transits, you can determine much more such as the orbital period, semi-major axis, etc. The image on the left is a very simple illustration of an ideal transit. The image on the right is an actual transit of Brown dwarf star TOI2119.01 b (TOI2119.01 refers to the star, and the b refers to the planet, or in this case brown dwarf star). This was caught through the 1 meter telescope at York University.\n",

        "    <strong>Clouds</strong> can cause a drop in brightness of over 40% in my experience, and when looking for a drop around 1%, this can make it impossible to measure even with differential photometry and proper image calibration.</li>\n",
        "    <strong>Transparency</strong> of the atmosphere is also important to get an idea of how good your data might be. Think of it like how clear or muddy the water is when looking at something at the bottom of a pool. <strong>Seeing</strong> is a measure that estimates how much your star will twinkle or shimmer. Think of it like how still the water is when looking at something at the bottom of a pool, except in this case, instead of water, it's the atmosphere, and you're looking at your star. This will give you an idea of how good your transit data might be as well. <a href=\"https://brazosvalleyastronomyclub.org/newsletters/winter-2018/seeing-transparency.html\">This website</a> explains seeing and transparency in more depth. <strong>Humidity</strong> is also important because if 85% relative humidity is reached, the telescope dome automatically closes to avoid damage. If you're using the York University Observatory, the <a href=\"https://www.cleardarksky.com/c/YrkUObONkey.html?1\">York University Observatory Clear Sky Chart</a> is a great resource for helping you choose a clear night that has all of this info, but the data is only for the next 72 hours.</li>\n",
        "    <li><strong>Stellar Magnitude</strong> - The brightness measurement (higher means more dim). With the light-collecting power of the 1-meter telescope, the upper limit is around 14.5. Any less bright and the exposure times would likely be too long. If you find a transit around 14 Vmag, you can look at the starfield by generating a starfield with the <a href=\"http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/predictions.php\">Exoplanet Transit Database</a> to ensure there are no other really bright stars in the FOV. If this is the case, you may be able to capture the transit with long exposure times. Ideally, though, 13 or below is great.</li>\n",
        "    <li><strong>Transit Depth</strong> - Generally, we want a drop in brightness of 1% or more in order to accurately extract the transit, but a larger transit depth is always easier to detect.

The stadium lights usually turn off at 11:00 (if they are even on), so a transit that starts at 11:30 or later is ideal for a good 30-minute baseline, although this is not a big deal because this can easily be corrected. The <a href=\"http://var2.astro.cz/ETD/predictions.php\">Exoplanet Transit Database</a> reports time in UTC, and depending on the time of year, it is either -4 or -5 hours to convert to EDT, which is the Toronto time zone.</li>\n",

        "\n",
        "<p>This section walks through a step-by-step process for your observing night at the York University observatory with the 1-meter Planewave telescope, providing tips that I have learned along the way to help ensure you catch a successful transit.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Observing Equipment and Software\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>On your first observing night at the York University observatory, you will come across various equipment and software that are essential for capturing a successful exoplanet transit. Below is an overview of these tools and their purposes:</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>CCD Camera:</h4>\n",
        "<p>The Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera, such as the SBIG STXL 6303, is a key instrument for capturing high-quality images of your transit. CCD cameras consist of an array of light-sensitive pixels that convert incoming photons into electronic signals. Each pixel is recorded as a number that represents the pixel intensity to form a black and white image. The resolution of the camera is determined by the number of pixels, and the signal-to-noise ratio is generally better with higher pixel counts.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Binning:</strong> 2x2 binning means combining 2x2 blocks of pixels into a single pixel, effectively increasing the sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio but reducing the resolution. This is useful in low-light conditions where capturing more light for a higher SNR is crucial, such as an exoplanet transit.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Max Count:</strong> The max count refers to the maximum value a pixel can register before saturating. It is important to avoid saturation, as it can lead to a loss of detail in bright areas of the image or it can mess up your transit. Keeping the max count below a certain threshold ensures the integrity of the data. To be safe and to avoid issues from \"ghost stars,\" aiming for a max count of around 25k is usually good.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Ghost stars:</strong> The SBIG 6303 camera is susceptible to ghost stars from previous images of overexposed objects. If a star is overexposed (a pixel has too high max count), the star can appear on the next images taken. This can completely ruin your transit curve, so it is crucial that the camera is nowhere near overexposed. Even well below the CCD damage limits, this can occur (around 40k max pixel count). For more information, you can refer to <a href=\"https://lco.global/documentation/ghosts-in-sbig-6303-camera-images/\">this link</a>.</p>\n",
        "<p><strong>Focusing:</strong> The software can do auto focusing by trying to fit the point spread function (PSF) of the star to a Gaussian curve. For exoplanet transits, people often intentionally defocus from the star to flatten the Gaussian curve and increase the radius of the PSF. This is because relying on more pixels reduces the effect of pixel-to-pixel sensitivity differences. In our case, our camera has a very zoomed-in FOV, and the Toronto skies already slightly defocus the image, so intentionally defocusing is not needed, but focusing isn't needed either unless it is terrible.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>The Telescope:</h4>\n",
        "<p>The main instrument for observing is the 1-meter aperture Planewave telescope.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Alt/Az Mount:</h4>\n",
        "<p>The alt-azimuth mount allows the telescope to move in altitude (up and down) and azimuth (left and right). This type of mount is simpler to use and set up compared to equatorial mounts. However, for long-exposure astrophotography, field derotation is required to compensate for the rotation of the field of view.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Field Derotation:</h4>\n",
        "<p>Field derotation is necessary when using alt-azimuth mounts for long exposures. As the Earth rotates, the field of view in the telescope also rotates. Field derotation corrects this by rotating the camera and filter at the same rate to get higher quality long-exposure images. The example below shows two transit images that were taken without field derotation; as you can see, the stars look fine, but any of the stars around the edges might leave the FOV, making it harder to align images and choose reference stars, and the images are not as high quality due to the slow rotation while taking images with long exposures.</p>\n",

        "| ![image-3.png](attachment:image-3.png)| ![image-4.png](attachment:image-4.png)|\n",
        "|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|\n",
        "<h4>Standard Filters (RVB):</h4>\n",
        "<p>Filters such as Red (R), Green (V), and Blue (B) are used to isolate specific wavelengths of light. Standard filters are essential in astrophotography to reduce the effects of light pollution and to isolate the light from the object of interest. The Red (R) filter, in particular, is commonly used for capturing transits as it reduces atmospheric distortion and provides clearer contrast for stars and planets. It also helps cut down on light pollution interference, improving the quality of the data.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Planewave Software:</h4>\n",
        "<p>Planewave software is used to control the telescope, including pointing, tracking, cooling, and field derotation. Planewave Shutter Control is in a separate window and is used for controlling the primary mirror shutters.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Maxim DL:</h4>\n",
        "<p>Maxim DL is a comprehensive software suite for astronomical imaging. It is used for controlling the CCD camera to set up and capture flats, bias, and transit images.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Camera Cooler:</h4>\n",
        "<p>The camera cooler is used to reduce the temperature of the CCD sensor. Cooling the camera to approximately 20 degrees below ambient temperature minimizes thermal noise, which can affect image quality. Thermal noise consists of random electronic signals generated by heat, which can obscure faint details in the images. Cooling the camera avoids the need for dark correction, simplifying the image processing workflow.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<h4>Mirror Cooler:</h4>\n",
        "<p>The mirror cooler helps stabilize the temperature of the telescope's primary mirror, preventing thermal distortions that can degrade image quality. Temperature changes can cause the mirror to expand or contract, leading to focus issues and image blurring. A mirror cooler ensures the mirror remains at a stable temperature, maintaining optimal performance throughout the observation session.</p>\n",

Once you have your exposure time for flats chosen, you can click on autosave and set up a script with the same exposure time to take flats. Make sure to change the name to something like \"FLAT_R_2x2\". I recommend taking as many as 50 before your transit and 50 after if you have the time.

Once you have your exposure time chosen, setup the autosave in the same way you did with flats and bias, making sure you change the name, exposure time, the mode to light, and the number of images to 999. You can abort the sequence whenever so we choose 999 because it is the max number you can set. </li>\n",

        "<p>Make sure that you request that the security camera in the 1-meter dome room has its IR lights turned off before capturing your transit. There are certain angles where the IR light can hit the CCD, causing light leaks in your images like the one below. However, as long as you’re not using any comparison stars in the affected area, the image is still usable:</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>When taking your Bias images, you can see the location of hot pixels as extra bright single pixels. When determining the exposure times for your transit images later, ensure that your stars are not on any of these hot pixels. Some are significant, and some are negligible with the flat and bias corrections. Also, if your max count is too high but it’s only due to a hot pixel, you can ignore them and rely on the max count caused by other factors. MAKE SURE ANY MAX COUNT OVER 35K IS ONLY FROM A HOT PIXEL. TOO HIGH OF A MAX COUNT FROM OTHER FACTORS CAN DAMAGE THE CCD!</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "<p>If your star is starting low in altitude and rising, make sure that you don’t choose too high of an exposure time. As the transit occurs, you will be seeing through less atmosphere with each image, so your max count may increase to numbers that could damage the CCD. Aim for 22-25k counts to leave ample room for an increase in pixel counts without damaging the CCD.</p>\n"

You can use a simple if statement to check whether the image your loading is the first image to skip alignment, then align all other images to the first image. One reccomendation I have is using a try-except block when aligning images. This is because A few of your images are always going to fail alignment for a number of reasons, and you dont want your code to stop running because of 1/1000 images failing to align.\n"

Save the positions and circle the stars in the image and display it so you can identify which is your transit star and which you will use as comparison stars. matplotlib.pyplot is a good tool for displaying your image and aperture test plots.\n",

Your plots should look something like the plot above.\n",

The noise that the transit and reference stars have in common is mostly due to Earth's atmosphere, and we take advantage of that to remove this noise from the transit light curve. The simplest method is to just divide your transit star light curve by your comparison star curve. A much better method is to take the weighted average of several comparison stars and divide by this (this is the method I used). This is relatively simple and yields great results with a proper choice of comparison stars.\n",
