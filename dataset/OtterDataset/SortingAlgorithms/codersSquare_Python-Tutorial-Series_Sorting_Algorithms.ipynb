    "Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The name \"Bubble Sort\" comes from the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list during each pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a basic explanation of how Bubble Sort works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "2. Compare the first two elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, swap them.\n",
    "3. Move to the next pair of elements (second and third), and repeat the comparison and swap if necessary.\n",
    "4. Continue this process, moving through the entire list one pair at a time.\n",
    "5. After completing one pass through the list, the largest element will \"bubble up\" to its correct position at the end of the list.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining elements in the list, each time the largest unsorted element will bubble up to its correct position.\n",
    "7. Continue this process until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble Sort is not efficient for large lists, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it impractical for large datasets. However, it is relatively simple to understand and implement, making it useful for educational purposes or for sorting small lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The advantage of bubble sort over other sorting techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The built-in ability to detect whether the list is sorted efficiently is the only advantage of bubble sort over other sorting techniques.\n",
    "- When the list is already sorted (which is the best-case scenario), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n).\n",
    "- It is faster than other in case of sorted array and consumes less time to describe whether the input array is sorted or not."
