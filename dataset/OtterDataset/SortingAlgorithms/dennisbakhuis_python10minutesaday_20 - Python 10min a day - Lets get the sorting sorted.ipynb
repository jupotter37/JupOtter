    "Two weeks ago we wrote a quick-sort algorithm which is a relatively efficient sorting algorithm. When we need to sort a list, Python comes with a built-in sorting function called sorted(). The algorithm implemented is called [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort) and was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002. The function takes an iterable and by default sorts values and characters in ascending order. The syntax of sorted() works like you expect:"

Sorted() returns a new list and therefore, we can also reverse the list using the reverse() function. The reverse function returns a reverse-iterator object. To print a list, we need to convert it first. Sorted() can also sort strings and will do this character by character, starting with numbers, followed by the alphabet. Now, the result is a list of characters. When sorting a list of strings, sorted() will order each item in alphabetical order. Something to keep in mind is that numbers in strings are sorted on a character level and therefore, sorting files might not be in the order you expect:"

    "When sorting strings, Python uses the Unicode value of the characters. This means that lower values of the Unicode encoding such as capital letters come before higher value characters such as the lower case alphabet. If a string contains a number and you want to sort by this number, we need to provide a key. A key is a function (or a lambda function which we still have to discuss in a future session) that transforms the item such that it can be sorted in a different way. The result of the key-function can be anything that sorted can do its sorting logic on. In our example, we created a function that extracts the number from the filename and converts it to an integer. Sorted now sorts these integers and returns the original list in that order. This makes the key-parameter a very powerful way to sort lists."

    "Something to note is that sorted() can only sort items that it can compare to all other items in the list. When you provide a list of mixed types, such as integers and strings, it is ambiguous to say that 25 is larger than ‘banana’. The same goes for a list of dictionaries. It has no idea on how to compare each dictionary, which consists of various values. These problems can be solved by defining a key-function that makes in explicit again."
