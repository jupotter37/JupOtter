    "### Backtracking <a id=\"backtracking\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "_Backtracking_ is a general algorithmic technique that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution. It's often used to solve problems that involve finding all possible solutions to a problem, such as finding all permutations, combinations, or subsets of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "_How Backtracking Works:_\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking algorithms try to build a solution to a computational problem incrementally, one piece at a time. Whenever the algorithm realizes that the current solution cannot be completed to a valid solution, it removes the last component added to the solution and tries another path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is often applied to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as puzzles, combinatorial problems, and parsing. Common examples include the N-Queens problem, solving mazes, crossword puzzles, and many types of optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Key Concepts:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**: Backtracking algorithms conceptually build a decision tree, where each node represents a partial solution. Traversing the tree involves making a series of decisions that gradually complete a solution.\n",
    "- **Pruning**: The process of eliminating branches from the decision tree based on constraints and conditions, without fully exploring them, is known as pruning. This is crucial for the efficiency of backtracking algorithms, as it significantly reduces the search space.\n",
    "- **State Space Tree**: This is a representation of all possible states (or partial states) of the solution. Backtracking traverses this tree by exploring child nodes (possible continuations of a partial solution) depth-first.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Steps in Backtracking Algorithms:_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose**: Select a candidate element to add to the current solution.\n",
    "2. **Constrain**: Check if the current candidate violates any constraints. If it does, abandon this candidate and backtrack.\n",
    "3. **Goal**: Check if the current solution satisfies the problem's goal. If it does, accept this solution.\n",
    "4. **Backtrack**: If the current candidate does not lead to a solution, remove it and try another candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Properties:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backtracking is often used to solve problems that involve finding all possible solutions to a problem, such as finding all permutations, combinations, or subsets of a set.\n",
    "- Backtracking is often implemented using recursion, and it can be more memory-intensive than other algorithms due to the overhead of maintaining the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Complexity:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity of a backtracking algorithm depends on the problem being solved. In general, it's often _O(n!)_ for problems that involve generating all permutations of a set, and _O(2^n)_ for problems that involve generating all subsets of a set.\n",
    "- The space complexity of a backtracking algorithm depends on the maximum depth of the recursion. In general, it's often _O(n)_ for problems that involve generating all permutations of a set, and _O(n)_ for problems that involve generating all subsets of a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example Problems:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-Queens Problem**: Given an _n x n_ chessboard, place _n_ queens on the board such that no two queens attack each other.\n",
    "- **Sudoku Solver**: Given a partially filled 9x9 grid, fill the grid with digits such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9.\n",
    "- **Generating All Subsets**: Given a set of distinct integers, generate all possible subsets (the power set) of the set.\n",
    "- **Generating All Permutations**: Given a collection of distinct integers, generate all possible permutations of the integers."
