    "The run time is going to be affected by a lot of different factors that have nothing to do with how “efficient” your code is.  Running the same code on different machines with different processors will produce different run times. Even running the code on the same machine will produce different run times depending on what else the processor is doing at the time.  So just using raw run times to do comparisons, is not always the best approach. The data being analyzed can also have a significant effect on the run time of a particular algorithm.  \n",
