    "Report Issue\n",
    "Conceptually, bubble sort is an implementation of a rather simple idea. Suppose we have a collection of integers that we want to sort in ascending order. Bubble sort proceeds to consider two adjacent elements at a time. If these two adjacent elements are out of order (in this case, the left element is strictly greater than the right element), bubble sort will swap them. It then proceeds to the next pair of adjacent elements. In the first pass of bubble sort, it will process every set of adjacent elements in the collection once, making swaps as necessary. The core idea of bubble sort is it will repeat this process until no more swaps are made in a single pass, which means the list is sorted."

    "GPT explanation of problem below\n",
    "- Yes, that's one way to think about it. The key function is used to transform each element in the input list into a corresponding element in the output list. In this case, the key function transforms each element x into a tuple (count[x], -x).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the sorted function compares the tuples corresponding to each pair of elements in the input list and orders the input list based on those comparisons. When two tuples are compared, the first element of each tuple is compared first. If the first elements are different, then the comparison is done based on the first element only. However, if the first elements are the same, then the comparison is done based on the second element (i.e., the tiebreaker).\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the case of nums = [2,3,1,3,2], the input list is transformed into a list of tuples [(2, -2), (2, -3), (1, -1), (2, -3), (2, -2)] based on the key function. When the sorted function compares the tuples (2, -2) and (2, -3), it sees that the first elements of both tuples are the same (i.e., 2), so it uses the second element (i.e., -2 and -3) as the tiebreaker. Since -2 is less than -3, the tuple (2, -2) comes before the tuple (2, -3) in the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the tuple (2, -2) comes after the tuple (2, -3) when compared, so it appears later in the sorted list. This is why 2 appears at the end of the sorted list instead of in the middle as it would if we sorted based on frequency alone. "
