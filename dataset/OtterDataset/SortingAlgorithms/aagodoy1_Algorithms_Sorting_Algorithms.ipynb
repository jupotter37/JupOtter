    "The QuickSort algorithm is an efficient sorting method based on the divide-and-conquer technique. It works by selecting a pivot element from the list and partitioning the elements into two sublists: those smaller than the pivot and those greater than or equal to it. Then, it recursively applies the same process to the sublists. The average-case time complexity of QuickSort is O(n logn), as it repeatedly divides the list into roughly equal halves. However, in the worst case, when the partitions are unbalanced, its complexity is O(n^2), which occurs if the largest or smallest element is always chosen as the pivot. The space complexity is O(n logn), as it requires additional space for the recursion stack. It is an in-place algorithm (it does not require significant extra space beyond the recursive calls) and is very efficient in practice, especially for large datasets."
