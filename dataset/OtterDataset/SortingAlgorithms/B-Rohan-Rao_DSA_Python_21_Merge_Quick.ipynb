    "## Merge Sorting  \n",
    "Merge Sort is a classic and efficient sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts of Merge Sort :-  \n",
    "- Divide: The list is recursively divided into two halves until each sublist contains a single element or is empty. This step essentially breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.    \n",
    "- Conquer (Sort and Merge): The sublists are then merged back together in a sorted order. This is done by comparing the elements of the sublists and arranging them in order. \n",
    "- Combine: The process of merging two sorted sublists to form a larger sorted list is the key operation in merge sort. The merge function repeatedly takes the smallest element from the front of each sublist and adds it to the new sorted list.  \n",

    "Detailed Steps  \n",

    "- Splitting:  \n",
    "Find the middle point of the list.\n",
    "Split the list into two halves.\n",

    "- Merging:  \n",
    "Create a new list to hold the sorted elements.\n",
    "Compare the first elements of both sublists.\n",
    "Append the smaller element to the new list and remove it from its sublist.\n",
    "Repeat the process until all elements from both sublists have been processed.\n",
    "If one sublist is empty before the other, append the remaining elements of the non-empty sublist to the new list."

    "- Partitioning:  \n",
