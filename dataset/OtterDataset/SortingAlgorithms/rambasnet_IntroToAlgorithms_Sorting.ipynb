    "## Sorting - Introduction\n",
    "- sort is a common task in daily lives: sorting playing cards; bills and piles of papers, books; jars of spices, etc.\n",
    "- sort is one of the most frequently performed computing tasks\n",
    "    - sort records in database\n",
    "    - lot of problems require sorting to quickly find and shift through and work with data\n",
    "- many algorithms have been devised\n",
    "    - each may perform well on a particular type of data or problem\n",
    "    - introduce us the technique of `divide and conquer`\n",
    "    - introduce us the multiple ways to do the dividing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sorting problem\n",
    "- given a range of values or records $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ with associated key values $k_1, k_2, ..., k_3$, the sorting problem is to arrange the records into any order $s$ such that the records $r_{s1}, r_{s2}, ..., r_{s3}$ have keys obeying the property $k_{s1} \\leq k_{s2} \\leq ... \\leq k_{sn}$\n",
    "- **stable sort** - if duplicate keys are allowed in the problem data then the initial ordering among duplicates are maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analyzing sort algorithms\n",
    "- it is traditional to measure the cost by counting the number of comparisons made between keys\n",
    "    - measure is usually closely related to the actual running time for the algorithm\n",
    "    - has the advantage of being machine and data-type independent\n",
    "- if the records being sorted are too large to move, it may be appropriate to count the number of swap operations\n",
    "- generally, we can assume that all records and keys are of fixed length, and that a single comparison or swap requires a constant amount of time regardless the data type of keys\n",
    "- if applications require  that a small number of records be sorted frequently, the constants in the running time equations that usually get ignored in asymptotic analysis now become crucial\n",
    "- some sorting algorithm may require significant extra memory beyond the input sequence"
