    "There are a few important points to be aware of when working with timing functions. First, different timers can have different resolutions, i.e. the smallest $\\Delta t$ that can be measured can depend on the timing function used. Second, for very fast operations, timing results can vary substantially from one run to the next and averaging over several runs (as timeit does) can provide more reliable results. Finally, the resolution of a timing function can depend on the operating system you are using. You should check that you can reliably measure times below 1e-3 seconds with time.time(). If you cannot, you should try one or more of the other timers available in the time module (e.g. time.perf_counter_ns()). See https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#functions and https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html for more information."
