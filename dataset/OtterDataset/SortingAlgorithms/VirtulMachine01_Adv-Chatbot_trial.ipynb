This process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Although it is not efficient for large datasets, Bubble Sort is often taught in introductory programming courses due to its simplicity. The algorithm is stable, meaning that the order of equal elements is preserved. It is best suited for small datasets or educational purposes.\n"
