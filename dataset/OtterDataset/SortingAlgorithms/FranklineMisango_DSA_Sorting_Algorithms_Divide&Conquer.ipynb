        "\n",
        "Analyzing the complexity of recursive algorithms can be tricky. It helps to track and follow the chain of recursive calls. We'll add some print statements to our `merge_sort` and `merge_functions` to display the _tree_ of recursive function calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can now see that each `merge_sort` call itself invokes `merge_sort` twice (but with an array half the size), and also invokes the `merge` function once to merge the two resulting arrays. The two calls to `merge_sort` themselves make two recursive calls followed by an invocation of `merge`. The division continues till we reach an list of size 1 or 0. Thus, the merge sort algorithm ultimately boils down to a series of `merge` operations performed on arrays of varying sizes. Inside the `merge` function we perform comparisons and add numbers to a new array.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise:** Verify that time complexity of the merge operation is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the sum of the sizes of the two input lists. Hint: Count the number of comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the overall complexity of `merge_sort`, we simply need to count how many times the `merge` function was invoked and the size of the input list for each invocation. Here's how all the subproblems can be visualized:\n",

Therefore the total number of comparisons at each level of the tree is $2^k * n/2^k = n$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, if the height of the tree is $h$, the total number of comparisons is $n*h$. Since there are $n$ sublists of size 1 at the lowest level, it follows that $2^{(h-1)} = n$ i.e. $h = \\log n + 1$. Thus the time complexity of the merge sort algorithms is $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
