    "### Approach 2: Merge and sort\n",
    "- **Concept:** This approach merges `nums2` into `nums1` at the positions of the zeros in `nums1` and then sorts the entire `nums1` array. This approach is pretty straight-forward and leverages built-in sorting functions.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** While this approach is simpler to implement, its efficiency is lower due to the sorting step, making it $O((n+m)log(n+m))$ in time complexity, which isn't optimal compared to directly merging sorted arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3: Three Pointers (Start from the Beginning)\n",
    "- **Concept:** Similar to the first approach but starts merging from the beginning of the arrays. It involves copying the initial segment of `nums1` to avoid overwriting and uses two pointers to track the current elements being compared in `nums1` and `nums2`.\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** Offers a linear time complexity of $O(n+m)$, but requires $O(m)$ extra space for the copy of the initial segment of `nums1`, which makes it slightly less space-efficient than the approach that starts from the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Last word\n",
    "- Considering both time and space efficiency, the **Three Pointers (Start from the End)** approach emerges as the most efficient solution for this problem. \n",
    "- It directly addresses the challenge of merging two sorted arrays in-place, without requiring additional space beyond the input arrays themselves. \n",
    "- This method cleverly utilizes the fact that nums1 has sufficient space to accommodate nums2 and performs the merge operation in reverse order, eliminating the need for extra storage or a subsequent sorting step."
