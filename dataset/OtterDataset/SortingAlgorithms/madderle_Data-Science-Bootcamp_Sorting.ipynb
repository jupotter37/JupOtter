    "### Heap Sort\n",
    "Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. It has a worst case complexity of O(nlogn). It is a sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent node is greater than the values in its two children nodes (max heap). Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as array and array based representation is space efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Build a max heap from the input data\n",
    "2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of tree.Heapify procedure can be applied to a node only if its children nodes are heapified. So the heapification must be performed in the bottom up order.\n",
    "3. Repeat above steps while size of heap is greater than 1."
