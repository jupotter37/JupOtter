    "Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. It was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log {n})$ comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ comparisons.\n",

Informally speaking, the contraction of an edge merges the nodes $u$ and $v$ into one, reducing the total number of nodes of the graph by one. All other edges connecting either $u$ or $v$ are \"reattached\" to the merged node, effectively producing a multigraph. Karger's basic algorithm iteratively contracts randomly chosen edges until only two nodes remain; those nodes represent a cut in the original graph. By iterating this basic algorithm a sufficient number of times, a minimum cut can be found with high probability (i.e. <i>Probability Amplification</i>).\n",
