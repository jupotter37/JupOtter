The deterministic version enumerates all permutations until it encounters a sorted one whereas the randomized version permutes its input randomly.

    "\n",
    "This is because the total number of permutations of an array of length $n$ is $n!$. Each permutation takes $O(n)$ time to check if it is sorted. Therefore, the total runtime is $O(n \\times n!)$.\n",
