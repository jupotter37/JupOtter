    "'''Why Inherit from the Exception Class for Custom Exceptions\n",
    "Inheriting from the Exception class is essential for creating custom exceptions in Python for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Compatibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniformity: By inheriting from Exception, custom exceptions adhere to a standardized structure and behavior. This ensures consistency in exception handling mechanisms throughout your codebase and the Python ecosystem.\n",
    "Compatibility: The Exception class provides a common interface and methods that are expected by built-in exception handling mechanisms. This makes custom exceptions seamlessly integrate with Python's exception handling framework.\n",
    "Hierarchy and Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Organization: Inheriting from Exception allows you to create hierarchies of custom exceptions, reflecting the relationships between different error conditions. This improves code organization and maintainability.\n",
    "Polymorphism: By treating custom exceptions as instances of the Exception class, you can write generic exception handling code that can catch and handle various exception types, including custom ones.\n",
    "Built-in Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and Methods: The Exception class provides attributes like args and message that can be used to store additional information about the exception. It also offers methods like __str__ for customizing the string representation.\n",
    "Error Handling Mechanisms: Custom exceptions can be caught and handled using the standard try-except blocks, providing a familiar and robust error handling mechanism.\n",
    "Clarity and Readability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent: Explicitly inheriting from Exception clearly conveys the intent of your custom class as an exception. This improves code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "Documentation: By inheriting from Exception, you can leverage the existing documentation and examples for exception handling, making it easier for other developers to understand and use your custom exceptions.\n",
    "In summary, inheriting from the Exception class is fundamental for creating effective and compatible custom exceptions in Python. It ensures consistency, enables hierarchical organization, provides essential functionality, and enhances code clarity.'''"
