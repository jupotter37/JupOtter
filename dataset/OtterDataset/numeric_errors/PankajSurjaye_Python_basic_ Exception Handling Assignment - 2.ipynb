    "# Exception handling is an important aspect of writing robust and maintainable Python code. Here are some best \n",

    "\n",
    "# Use Specific Exception Types: Catch specific exceptions rather than broad ones when possible. This allows you\n",
    "#     to handle different errors in distinct ways. For example, catch FileNotFoundError instead of the more general IOError.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid Empty except Blocks: Avoid using empty except blocks (i.e., except: with no specific exception type). It \n",
    "#     makes it difficult to identify and debug issues. Only catch exceptions you are prepared to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use try-except Blocks Selectively: Only use try-except blocks around code that you expect might raise an exception. \n",
    "#     Don't wrap large sections of code in a single try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clean Up with finally: Use a finally block to ensure that cleanup code (e.g., closing files or network connections) \n",
    "#     is executed, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handle Exceptions Gracefully: When catching exceptions, handle them gracefully. Provide informative error messages,\n",
    "#     and avoid crashing the program. Consider logging the error for future analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Don't Suppress Exceptions: Avoid suppressing exceptions by catching them and doing nothing. If you catch an exception,\n",
    "#     provide a meaningful response, whether that's logging the error or taking corrective action.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Multiple except Blocks: When handling different exceptions differently, use multiple except blocks. This makes your \n",
    "#     code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reraise Exceptions with raise: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it, consider re-raising it with raise to allow\n",
    "#     higher-level error handling or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid Deep Nesting: Avoid deep nesting of try-except blocks. It can make your code hard to read and maintain. Use \n",
    "#     functions and classes to organize and encapsulate error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use Custom Exceptions: Create custom exceptions when needed to represent specific error conditions in your code.\n",
    "#     This improves code clarity and allows for more precise error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keep Error Messages Clear and Informative: Write clear and informative error messages that help in diagnosing and \n",
    "#     debugging issues. Include relevant context in the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consider Context Managers: When working with resources like files or database connections, use context managers\n",
    "#     (e.g., with statements) to automatically handle resource cleanup and exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Document Exception Handling: Document how your code handles exceptions, especially when creating custom exceptions. \n",
    "#     Describe what each exception means and how it should be handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Exception Handling: Write unit tests that specifically target exception handling scenarios. Ensure your exception\n",
    "#     handling code works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
