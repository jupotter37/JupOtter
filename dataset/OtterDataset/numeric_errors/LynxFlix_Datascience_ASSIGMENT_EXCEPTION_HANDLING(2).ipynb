    "When creating custom exceptions in Python, it's essential to inherit from the built-in Exception class (or one of its subclasses) because it ensures that the custom exception behaves like a standard exception. Here are the key reasons why this is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consistency with Standard Exception Handling\n",
    "    By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exception integrates seamlessly with Python's built-in exception handling mechanism. This means it can be used with try, except, else, and finally blocks just like any other built-in exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access to Exception Handling Features\n",
    "    The Exception class provides various attributes and methods that are useful for exception handling, such as args, which stores the arguments passed to the exception, and methods like __str__ and __repr__ for representing the exception as a string. By inheriting from Exception, your custom exception class automatically inherits these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hierarchical Structure\n",
    "    Python's exception handling is based on a hierarchy of exception classes. By inheriting from the Exception class, your custom exceptions fit into this hierarchy, allowing for more flexible and granular exception handling. For example, you can catch specific exceptions or more general ones higher up in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Interoperability with Libraries and Frameworks\n",
    "    Many Python libraries and frameworks expect exceptions to be derived from the Exception class. By following this convention, your custom exceptions will be compatible with these libraries and frameworks, ensuring that they can handle your exceptions appropriately.\n",
