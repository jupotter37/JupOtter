    "**Q1: Why do we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: We have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception to ensure that our custom exception is a subclass of the Exception class. This is required because all exceptions in Python are subclasses of the Exception class. By subclassing the Exception class, we can ensure that our custom exception can be handled by the Python exception handling system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Write a python program to print Python Exception Hierarchy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception_class):\n",
    "    print(exception_class)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception_class.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass)\n",

    "**Q3: What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The ArithmeticError class defines the following errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* FloatingPointError: This error is raised when an operation on floating-point numbers results in an invalid result, such as infinity or NaN.\n",
    "* OverflowError: This error is raised when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be represented by the data type.\n",
    "* ZeroDivisionError: This error is raised when a division operation is attempted by dividing a number by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# FloatingPointError\n",
    "print(1.0 / 0.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# OverflowError\n",
    "print(2 ** 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "print(10 / 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example KeyError and IndexError.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The LookupError class is used to represent errors that occur when a lookup operation fails. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when a key is not present in a dictionary or when an index is out of range in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# KeyError\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_dict['key'])\n",
    "except KeyError:\n",
    "    print('The key \"key\" does not exist in the dictionary')\n",
    "\n",
    "# IndexError\n",
    "my_list = []\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_list[0])\n",
    "except IndexError:\n",
    "    print('The index 0 is out of range for the list')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: ImportError is raised when Python is unable to import a module. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when the module does not exist or when the module is not installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ModuleNotFoundError is a more specific error that is raised when Python is unable to find a module in the Python search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ImportError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import my_module\n",
    "except ImportError:\n",
    "    print('The module \"my_module\" does not exist')\n",
    "\n",
    "# ModuleNotFoundError\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import my_module\n",
    "except ModuleNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print('The module \"my_module\" was not found in the Python search path')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: List down some best practices for exception handling in python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use specific exception classes whenever possible. This will help you to handle different types of errors in a more granular way.\n",
    "* Use try...except statements to handle exceptions gracefully. This will help to prevent your program from crashing.\n",
    "* Use a finally clause to clean up resources, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "* Log all exceptions so that you can track them down and fix the underlying problems.\n"
