    "2. It can be caught using the try-except statement, just like any built-in exception.\n",

    "Ans.: 1. Use specific exceptions: Catching specific exceptions allows you to handle them in a more targeted way. Catching the base Exception class \n",
    "is not recommended as it can catch any type of exception, which can make it harder to debug and maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use try-except blocks judiciously: Use try-except blocks only when necessary and only for the code that may raise exceptions. Avoid using a \n",
    "try-except block to catch all exceptions within a function or program, as it can hide important errors and make debugging difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use finally blocks for cleanup: Use finally blocks to ensure that resources (such as files, network connections, or database connections) are p\n",
    "roperly released, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Handle exceptions gracefully: Instead of letting your program crash with an unhandled exception, handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful\n",
    "error messages to users. This will help users understand the issue and allow them to take appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Don't silence exceptions: Avoid using an empty except block as it can silence exceptions and make it harder to diagnose errors. If you're not sure \n",
    "what exceptions to catch, use a specific exception or the base Exception class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use logging to track exceptions: Use Python's built-in logging module to log exceptions and other errors in your program. This will help you track\n",
