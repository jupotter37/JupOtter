    "**Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Exception` class in Python is the base class for all exceptions. When creating a custom exception, you inherit from the `Exception` class (or one of its subclasses) to ensure that your custom exception is recognized by Python's exception handling mechanisms. This makes your custom exception part of the standard exception hierarchy, which allows it to be caught and handled using the same mechanisms used for built-in exceptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the `Exception` class, you gain the following benefits:\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: Your custom exceptions behave like built-in exceptions, ensuring consistency in error handling.\n",
    "2. **Compatibility**: They can be caught using generic exception handling blocks (`except Exception`) or specific ones if needed.\n",
    "3. **Extensibility**: You can add custom attributes and methods to your exceptions, providing more context and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Write a Python program to print the Python Exception Hierarchy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python program that prints the exception hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def print_exception_hierarchy(exception, level=0):\n",
    "    print('  ' * level + exception.__name__)\n",
    "    for subclass in exception.__subclasses__():\n",
    "        print_exception_hierarchy(subclass, level + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "print_exception_hierarchy(BaseException)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this program will print the hierarchy of all built-in exceptions in Python, starting from `BaseException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ArithmeticError` class is the base class for all errors that occur during arithmetic operations. Some of the errors defined under `ArithmeticError` include:\n",
    "- `ZeroDivisionError`\n",
    "- `OverflowError`\n",
    "- `FloatingPointError`\n",
    "\n",
    "**ZeroDivisionError**:\n",
    "Occurs when a division or modulo operation is performed with a divisor of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**OverflowError**:\n",
    "Occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = math.exp(1000)  # This will raise an OverflowError\n",
    "except OverflowError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Why LookupError class is used? Explain with an example of KeyError and IndexError.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LookupError` class is the base class for errors raised when a key or index used to access a collection (like a dictionary or a list) is invalid. It helps to catch all lookup-related errors with a single exception handler if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KeyError**:\n",
    "Raised when a dictionary is accessed with a key that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "    value = my_dict['c']\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**IndexError**:\n",
    "Raised when a sequence (like a list or a tuple) is accessed with an index that is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    value = my_list[5]\n",
    "except IndexError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`ImportError` is raised when an import statement fails to import a module. This can happen if the module does not exist, if there is a circular import, or if there is a problem with the module itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import non_existent_module\n",
    "except ImportError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` that is specifically raised when a module cannot be found. It was introduced in Python 3.6 to provide a more specific exception for this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    import non_existent_module\n",
    "except ModuleNotFoundError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Specific Exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions instead of using a generic `except Exception` to avoid masking other errors.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except ValueError as e:\n",
    "       # handle ValueError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Bare Excepts**: Avoid using bare `except` clauses which can catch unexpected errors and make debugging difficult.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       # handle all exceptions derived from Exception\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clean Up Resources**: Use `finally` to clean up resources (like closing files or network connections) to ensure they are properly released.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       file = open('file.txt', 'r')\n",
    "       # perform operations\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       file.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use `with` Statement for Resources**: Prefer using the `with` statement for resource management to ensure automatic cleanup.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "       # perform operations\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Log Exceptions**: Use logging to record exceptions, which can help in debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       logging.error(\"An error occurred\", exc_info=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Raise Exceptions with Messages**: Provide clear and informative messages when raising exceptions to make debugging easier.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if some_condition:\n",
    "       raise ValueError(\"Invalid value provided for 'some_condition'\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Document Exceptions**: Document the exceptions your functions may raise to inform users of your code.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def my_function(param):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       Does something.\n",
    "\n",
    "       :param param: Parameter description\n",
    "       :raises ValueError: If param is not valid\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       if not isinstance(param, int):\n",
    "           raise ValueError(\"param must be an integer\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle exceptions in a way that allows the program to continue running if possible.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # code that may raise an exception\n",
    "   except Exception as e:\n",
    "       print(\"An error occurred, but the program will continue\")\n",
    "   ```"
