    "# Q3. What errors are defined in the ArithmeticError class? Explain any two with an example.\n",
    "# Ans:=The ArithmeticError class in Python is a built-in exception class that serves as the base class for various arithmetic-related errors. It is a subclass of StandardError, which in turn is a subclass of Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Errors Defined in the ArithmeticError Class\n",
    "# The ArithmeticError class has several derived exceptions, each representing a specific type of arithmetic-related error. Here are some of the key exceptions derived from ArithmeticError:\n",
    "\n",
    "# OverflowError: Raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the numeric type.\n",
    "# ZeroDivisionError: Raised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.\n",
    "# FloatingPointError: Raised when a floating-point operation fails.\n",
    "# DecimalException: Raised for exceptions related to the decimal module.\n",
    "# Examples of Two Arithmetic Errors\n",
    "# 1. OverflowError\n",
    "# Description: An OverflowError is raised when a calculation produces a result that is too large to be represented within the range of the numeric type being used. This is common in languages with fixed-precision arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# def test_overflow():\n",
    "#     try:\n",
    "#         # Attempt to compute a large power\n",

    "# In the example, calculating 10 ** 1000 attempts to raise 10 to an extremely large power, which may exceed the limits of the numeric type.\n",
    "# Python handles very large integers automatically with its built-in int type, but in some contexts (like older versions or different numeric types), this might result in an OverflowError.\n",
    "# 2. ZeroDivisionError\n",

LookupError is a subclass of the built-in Exception class and has two primary subclasses:\n",

    "# LookupError is used to provide a common base for exceptions that occur during lookup operations, enabling you to catch these errors in a unified way if needed. By catching LookupError, you can handle both IndexError and KeyError exceptions with a single except block when you don't need to distinguish between the types of lookup failures.\n",

    "# Q5. Explain ImportError. What is ModuleNotFoundError?\n",

    "# In Python, both ImportError and ModuleNotFoundError are exceptions that occur when there is an issue with importing a module or package. They are related but have distinct uses:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Definition: ImportError is a general exception that is raised when an import statement fails to import a module or package. This could be due to various reasons, such as a missing module, incorrect module name, or issues within the module itself.\n",

    "# Example: Suppose you have a script with the following import statement:\n",

    "\n",
    "# import non_existent_module\n",

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "Ans:=Exception handling is crucial for writing robust and maintainable Python code. Here are some best practices to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Specific Exceptions\n",
    "Be Specific: Catch specific exceptions rather than a generic Exception. This makes your error handling more precise and helps in diagnosing issues more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "Avoid Bare Except: Avoid using except: without specifying the exception type, as it catches all exceptions including those you may not expect or handle correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    # Handle exception\n",
    "2. Handle Exceptions at the Right Level\n",
    "Granular Handling: Handle exceptions at the level where you can actually do something meaningful about them. For example, if you’re working with file operations, handle IOError close to the file handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "        data = f.read()\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File not found.\")\n",
    "3. Use finally for Cleanup\n",
    "Resource Management: Use the finally block to ensure that resources such as files or network connections are properly closed or cleaned up, regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open('file.txt')\n",
    "    # Process file\n",
    "except IOError:\n",
    "    print(\"An error occurred.\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    f.close()\n",
    "Context Managers: Prefer using context managers (with statements) for resource management, as they automatically handle cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('file.txt') as f:\n",
    "    data = f.read()\n",
    "4. Log Exceptions\n",
    "Logging: Instead of just printing error messages, use Python’s logging module to record exceptions. This helps in tracking and debugging issues later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n",

    "    result = 1 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
    "    logging.error(\"An error occurred: %s\", e)\n",
    "5. Reraise Exceptions When Necessary\n",
    "Preserve Traceback: If you need to handle an exception but still want to propagate it up the stack, use raise without arguments inside an except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    # Handle it, but rethrow it to be handled further up\n",
    "    raise\n",
    "6. Avoid Empty except Clauses\n",
    "Avoid Silence: An empty except block (i.e., except:) should be avoided because it swallows exceptions without any handling or notification, which can make debugging difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    pass  # This should be avoided\n",
    "7. Be Careful with Exception Handling in Loops\n",
    "Handle Carefully: When handling exceptions inside loops, be cautious not to mask errors or inadvertently skip important iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in items:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        process(item)\n",
    "    except SomeException:\n",
    "        handle_exception()\n",
    "8. Document Your Exception Handling\n",
    "Document Decisions: Clearly document why certain exceptions are being caught and how they are being handled. This improves code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "except SomeException:\n",
    "    # Handle the exception in this way because...\n",
    "9. Test Your Exception Handling\n",
    "Unit Testing: Ensure that your exception handling code is covered by unit tests. This verifies that your application behaves as expected in the presence of errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "import unittest\n",
