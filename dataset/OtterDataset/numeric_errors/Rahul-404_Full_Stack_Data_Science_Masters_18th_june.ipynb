    "The `else` block in a `try`-`except` statement is used to specify code that should be executed if the `try` block does not raise any exceptions. It allows you to run code that should only execute when no errors occur, effectively separating the normal execution path from the error-handling path. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Role of the `else` Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Execution After `try` Block**: Code inside the `else` block runs only if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block. This is useful for placing code that should be executed when everything goes as planned.\n",
    "- **Separation of Concerns**: Helps in keeping the error handling and the successful execution path separate, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "except ExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",

    "### **Example Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you need to read data from a file and then process that data. You want to handle exceptions if the file cannot be opened or read, and you also want to ensure that additional processing only occurs if the file is read successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def read_and_process_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n",
    "            data = file.read()\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: The file was not found.\")\n",
    "    except IOError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: An I/O error occurred while reading the file.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # This block executes if no exceptions were raised\n",
    "        print(\"File read successfully. Processing data...\")\n",
    "        # Process the data (for example, count the number of lines)\n",
    "        num_lines = len(data.splitlines())\n",
    "        print(f\"Number of lines in the file: {num_lines}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "read_and_process_file(\"example.txt\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Attempts to open and read a file. If the file does not exist or there is an I/O error, exceptions will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`except` Blocks**:\n",
    "   - **`FileNotFoundError`**: Handles cases where the file does not exist.\n",
    "   - **`IOError`**: Handles other I/O related errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`else` Block**:\n",
    "   - Executes only if the `try` block completes without exceptions. Here, it prints a success message and processes the data (e.g., counting the number of lines in the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`finally` Block** (not used in this example but useful in practice):\n",
    "   - Executes regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It can be used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Using `else` Block:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of Normal Execution and Error Handling**: Keeps the code that should run after successful execution separate from the error-handling code.\n",
    "- **Improved Readability**: Makes it clear that the code in the `else` block is only executed when no exceptions occur, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "- **Avoids Redundancy**: Avoids the need to place normal execution code within the `try` block, where it might be mixed with error-handling logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `else` block appropriately, you can create cleaner, more understandable, and more reliable exception-handling structures in your Python code."

    "Yes, a `try`-`except` block can be nested inside another `try`-`except` block in Python. This allows you to handle exceptions at different levels of your code, providing more granular control over error handling.

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Handles exceptions related to file operations such as opening and reading the file.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Inner `try` Block**:\n",
    "   - Nested within the outer `try` block, it handles exceptions that may occur during data processing and parsing.\n",
    "   - Catches `ValueError` if the data cannot be converted to integers, and a general `Exception` block for any unexpected errors during parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - **File Handling Errors**: Managed by the outer `except` blocks.\n",
    "   - **Parsing Errors**: Managed by the inner `except` blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Nested `try`-`except` Blocks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation of Error Context**: Allows specific error handling for operations within a broader error-handling scope.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Readability**: Keeps the error-handling logic clear and focused on particular tasks.\n",
    "- **Controlled Execution**: Ensures that if an inner block fails, it can be handled separately from outer block issues.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Custom Exception Class**:\n",
    "   - `InvalidAgeError` subclasses `Exception`.\n",
    "   - The `__init__` method takes `age` and `message` as parameters. The `age` parameter allows you to store the invalid value that triggered the exception, while `message` provides a default error message.\n",
    "   - The `__str__` method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of the exception, including the age value that caused the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the Custom Exception**:\n",
    "   - In the `set_age` function, if the provided age is not valid (not between 1 and 149), an `InvalidAgeError` is raised.\n",
    "   - The `try`-`except` block catches this custom exception and prints the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Custom Exception Classes**:\n",

    "**Logging** in Python is a way to track and record events that occur during the execution of a program. It is a critical tool in software development for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications. The `logging` module in Python provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Logging is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Debugging**:\n",
    "   - Logging helps developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues by providing insights into the application’s behavior, including what the application was doing before an error occurred.\n",
    "   - It allows you to trace back the sequence of events leading up to a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - Logs are essential for monitoring the health and performance of an application in production. They can indicate if the application is behaving as expected or if there are performance issues or errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Auditing and Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Logs can be used to keep track of user actions, system events, and other significant activities. This is important for auditing purposes, especially in applications that handle sensitive data or require compliance with regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Instead of letting exceptions crash the application, you can log them and handle them gracefully. This ensures that the application continues to run even if errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documentation**:\n",
    "   - Logs can serve as a form of documentation, providing a historical record of what the application did and how it interacted with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Usage of Python’s `logging` Module**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of how to use Python's `logging` module:\n",

    "    handlers=[\n",
    "        logging.StreamHandler()  # Output logs to the console\n",
    "        # You can also add file handlers to log to a file, e.g. logging.FileHandler('app.log')\n",
    "    ]\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger object\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",

    "# Log messages of various severity levels\n",
    "logger.debug('This is a debug message.')\n",
    "logger.info('This is an info message.')\n",

    "    1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    logger.exception('An exception occurred')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `logging.basicConfig()`: Configures the logging system. You can set the logging level (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`), specify the format of log messages, and define handlers.\n",
    "   - `level=logging.DEBUG`: Sets the logging level to `DEBUG`, which means all messages of this level and higher will be logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log Messages**:\n",
    "   - Different log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`) help categorize the severity of messages. Use the appropriate level for each message depending on its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Logging**:\n",
    "   - `logger.exception()`: Logs an exception with traceback information. Useful for capturing detailed error reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Logging Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Logging**:\n",
    "   - You can configure logging to output to a file using `logging.FileHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loggers, Handlers, and Formatters**:\n",
    "   - **Loggers**: Create different loggers for different parts of an application.\n",

    "In Python's `logging` module, log levels are used to indicate the severity or importance of log messages. They help categorize and filter logs, so you can control the amount and type of information logged, based on what you need at different times (e.g., during development, testing, or in production).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Log Levels and Their Purposes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`DEBUG`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Provides detailed information, typically useful only for diagnosing problems. It’s the most granular level of logging and is usually turned on during development or troubleshooting.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: Use `DEBUG` for detailed diagnostic information, such as variable values, flow of execution, and function calls.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     \n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     def process_data(data):\n",
    "         logger.debug(f\"Processing data: {data}\")\n",
    "         # Process the data\n",
    "     \n",
    "     process_data(\"sample data\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`INFO`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Provides general information about the application's operation. It's less detailed than `DEBUG` but gives insights into key events and milestones.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: Use `INFO` for logging significant events such as the start and end of processes, configuration details, and successful completions of tasks.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     \n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     def start_service():\n",
    "         logger.info(\"Service started successfully.\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "     start_service()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`WARNING`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Indicates a potential problem or an unexpected situation that is not immediately critical but might lead to issues if not addressed.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: Use `WARNING` to log issues that are not errors but could cause future problems, such as deprecated API usage, near-limit resource usage, or minor configuration issues.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     \n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     def check_disk_space(used_space, total_space):\n",
    "         if used_space > total_space * 0.9:\n",
    "             logger.warning(\"Disk space usage is over 90%%.\")\n",
    "     \n",
    "     check_disk_space(95, 100)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`ERROR`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Logs errors that cause an operation to fail but do not stop the entire application. These indicate serious issues that need attention but are recoverable.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: Use `ERROR` to capture exceptions or failures in operations where recovery might be possible, such as handling failed API requests, database operations, or file I/O errors.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     \n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",

    "         logger.error(\"Division by zero error occurred.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`CRITICAL`**\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Represents the most severe log level, indicating a critical failure that may prevent the application from continuing to run or require immediate attention.\n",
    "   - **When to Use**: Use `CRITICAL` for logging fatal issues that indicate a serious problem, such as database connectivity issues that stop the application or critical configuration errors that prevent startup.\n",
    "   - **Example**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import logging\n",
    "     \n",
    "     logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "     logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "     \n",

    "     except RuntimeError:\n",
    "         logger.critical(\"Failed to connect to the database. Application will exit.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "logger.error(\"This is an error message.\")\n",
    "logger.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`DEBUG`**: Detailed information for developers, useful for debugging.\n",
    "- **`INFO`**: General operational information, indicating key events and milestones.\n",
    "- **`WARNING`**: Alerts about potential problems that are not immediately critical but may need attention.\n",
    "- **`ERROR`**: Logs errors that impact functionality but do not stop the application.\n",
    "- **`CRITICAL`**: Serious issues that likely prevent the application from running or require immediate action.\n",

    "In Python's logging module, **log formatters** are used to define the layout and content of log messages. They specify how log records should be formatted before being output by log handlers. Customizing log formats helps in making logs more readable and structured, which is crucial for monitoring and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose of Log Formatters**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: Ensures that log messages follow a consistent format, which is helpful for parsing and analyzing logs.\n",
    "2. **Readability**: Makes logs more readable by including relevant information in a structured manner.\n",
    "3. **Detail**: Allows you to include specific details like timestamps, log levels, and message content in the log output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using Formatters in Python Logging**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `logging` module uses the `Formatter` class to specify the format of log messages. You can set up a formatter and attach it to a handler to control how log messages are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Format String Syntax**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The format string used in a formatter can include various placeholders that represent different parts of the log record. The placeholders are replaced with actual values from the log record when the message is formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here are some commonly used placeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log message.\n",
    "   - `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.\n",
    "   - `%(levelname)s`: Log level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
    "   - `%(message)s`: The actual log message.\n",
    "   - `%(filename)s`: Name of the file where the log message was generated.\n",
    "   - `%(lineno)d`: Line number in the source file where the log message was generated.\n",
    "   - `%(funcName)s`: Name of the function where the log message was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Customizing Log Message Format**\n",

    "logger.critical(\"This is a critical message.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Formatter**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(filename)s - %(lineno)d - %(message)s')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This defines the format for log messages, including the timestamp, logger name, log level, filename, line number, and the actual message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Up a Handler**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "   console_handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This creates a stream handler (for outputting logs to the console) and sets its formatter to the custom one defined earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configuring the Logger**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "   logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "   logger.addHandler(console_handler)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This sets up the logger with the DEBUG level and adds the custom handler to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logging Messages**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   logger.debug(\"This is a debug message.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Logs messages at various levels to see the formatted output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Formatting**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `Formatter` with more advanced options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date Format**: Customize the date and time format using `%(asctime)s` with the `datefmt` parameter.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Attributes**: If you use custom attributes in your log records, you can include those in your format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "Log formatters in Python’s logging module provide a way to define the structure and content of log messages. By customizing log formats, you can make your logs more informative and easier to read.

    "\n",
    "### **2. Logging in Other Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "In each module, create a logger specific to that module. This logger will inherit the configuration from the root logger but can have additional settings or handlers if required.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "   - **`print`**: Primarily used for simple, ad-hoc output to the console. It's often used during development for quick debugging or to display information to users.\n",

    "4. **Formatting**:\n",
    "   - **`print`**: Provides minimal formatting options. You need to manually format strings if you need specific output formats.\n",
    "   - **`logging`**: Supports advanced formatting options using formatters, allowing you to customize the layout of log messages, including timestamps, log levels, and other metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configuration**:\n",
    "   - **`print`**: Has no configuration capabilities beyond basic output. All messages are printed as they are generated.\n",
    "   - **`logging`**: Offers extensive configuration options, including log levels, handlers, formatters, and loggers. This allows for detailed control over how and where log messages are recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **`print`**: Typically does not impact performance significantly but can be inefficient for extensive debugging due to its synchronous nature and lack of output control.\n",
    "   - **`logging`**: Designed to handle large volumes of log messages efficiently. Logging can be configured to be asynchronous and to manage performance with different handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use `logging` Over `print`**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Production Code**:\n",
    "   - Use `logging` for production code to ensure that important events, errors, and system information are recorded systematically and can be reviewed later. `print` statements are usually removed from production code as they don’t offer the same level of detail or control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debugging and Monitoring**:\n",
    "   - For debugging, use `logging` to capture detailed information with different severity levels. This allows for better analysis of issues and understanding of the application’s behavior over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Use `logging` to record errors and exceptions, including stack traces, which are crucial for diagnosing problems and understanding their context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Application Behavior Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Use `logging` to track significant application events, such as user actions, system states, or resource usage, which are valuable for monitoring and auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Configurability**:\n",
    "   - When you need to configure the output destination (e.g., log to a file or a remote server), control the log level, or format the output, `logging` provides the flexibility and options needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `print`**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"This is a simple message\")\n",
    "print(\"The value is:\", value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using `logging`**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logger\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Log messages with different severity levels\n",
    "logger.debug(\"Debug message: Detailed information for developers.\")\n",
    "logger.info(\"Info message: General application information.\")\n",
    "logger.warning(\"Warning message: Potential issues that may need attention.\")\n",
    "logger.error(\"Error message: An error occurred, but the application can continue.\")\n",
    "logger.critical(\"Critical message: A serious error that may prevent the application from continuing.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `print`** for simple output, quick debugging, and development. It's straightforward but lacks features for structured and controlled output.\n",
    "- **Use `logging`** for robust, scalable, and maintainable logging in applications. It supports different log levels, multiple output destinations, advanced formatting, and configuration options. It is essential for production code, error handling, and detailed tracking of application behavior."

    "2. **Create a Logger**: Get a logger instance to record the log message.\n",
    "3. **Log the Message**: Write the message with the desired log level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(\n",
    "    filename='app.log',                   # Log file name\n",
    "    level=logging.INFO,                   # Log level\n",

    "\n",
    "# Log the message\n",
    "logger.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`filename='app.log'`**: Specifies the name of the log file where log entries will be written.\n",
    "2. **`level=logging.INFO`**: Sets the log level to INFO. This means only messages with a severity of INFO or higher will be recorded.\n",
    "3. **`format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'`**: Defines the format of the log messages. It includes the timestamp, log level, and message.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Running the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the program, it will create (or append to) the `app.log` file and write the log message \"Hello, World!\" with the INFO level. If you run the program multiple times, each new entry will be appended to the end of the file, preserving previous log messages.\n",
