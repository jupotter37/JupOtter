    "# Q1: Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Exception class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in Python. When creating a custom exception,\n",
    "# it is a best practice to inherit from the Exception class (or one of its subclasses) because it ensures\n",
    "# that the custom exception behaves like a standard exception in Python. It provides a consistent interface\n",
    "# and allows the custom exception to be caught by generic exception handling code.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Best practices for exception handling:\n",
    "# 1. Catch specific exceptions: Avoid catching general exceptions unless absolutely necessary.\n",
    "# 2. Use the `finally` block to clean up resources: Ensure resources like files or network connections are properly closed.\n",
    "# 3. Log exceptions: Use logging to record exception details for debugging purposes.\n",
    "# 4. Avoid using exceptions for control flow: Exceptions should be used for error handling, not for controlling normal program flow.\n",
    "# 5. Provide meaningful error messages: Include relevant information in the exception messages to help diagnose issues.\n",
    "# 6. Re-raise exceptions if necessary: If you catch an exception but cannot handle it properly, re-raise it to allow higher-level code to handle it.\n",
    "# 7. Use custom exceptions for application-specific errors: Create custom exceptions to handle specific conditions in your application clearly.\n"
