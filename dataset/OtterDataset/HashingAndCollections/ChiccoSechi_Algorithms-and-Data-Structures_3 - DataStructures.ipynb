    "# Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook on Data Structures! This notebook is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to various data structures, which are fundamental components in computer science and programming. Understanding data structures is crucial for developing efficient and optimized algorithms and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it possible to visualize the Data Structures following this link: https://visualgo.net/en\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are Data Structures?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static and Dynamic Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures can be broadly categorized into static and dynamic types, based on how they manage memory and handle changes in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Data Structures**: These data structures have a fixed size determined at compile time. They allocate a set amount of memory during their creation, and this size cannot be changed during runtime. Examples of static data structures include arrays and static queues. They are generally simpler to implement and have predictable performance characteristics. However, their fixed size can lead to inefficiencies if the allocated space is not fully utilized or if the structure needs to grow beyond its initial capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Data Structures**: These data structures can grow or shrink in size during runtime, allowing them to adapt to the needs of the application. Memory is allocated and deallocated as elements are added or removed. Examples include linked lists, dynamic queues, and dynamic arrays (such as Python's lists). Dynamic data structures offer greater flexibility and can handle varying amounts of data more efficiently. However, they may involve additional overhead for managing memory and can be more complex to implement compared to static data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the following key data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.\n",
    "2. **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.\n",
    "3. **Linked Lists and Double Linked List**: A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next (Linked List) or where each elements points to each others (Double Linked List).\n",
    "4. **Hash Tables**: A structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookups.\n",
    "5. **Trees**: A hierarchical structure with nodes connected by edges, with a single root node.\n",
    "6. **Heaps**: A specialized tree-based structure that satisfies the heap property, useful for priority queues and efficient access to the smallest or largest element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the basic concepts and operations of each data structure.\n",
    "- Learn how to implement these data structures in Python."

    "## Stack \n",
    "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in programming for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data that follows a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Stack operates:\n",
    "1. **Push Operation:** Adds an element to the top of the stack. If the stack is full, this operation may cause an overflow.\n",
    "2. **Pop Operation:** Removes the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, this operation may cause an underflow.\n",
    "3. **Peek Operation:** Retrieves the top element of the stack without removing it, allowing you to see the last added element.\n",
    "4. **IsEmpty Operation:** Checks if the stack is empty, returning true if there are no elements in the stack.\n",
    "5. **IsFull Operation:** Checks if the stack is full, returning true if no more elements can be added (applicable to stacks with a fixed size).\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack data structure is implemented using arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science, providing a simple yet powerful way to manage data in a specific order. Their LIFO nature makes them suitable for a variety of applications where the most recently added element needs to be accessed or removed first."

    "## Singly Linked List \n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations; instead, each node contains a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Structure:** Each node in a linked list typically contains two parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Next (or Link):** A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Head Node:** The first node in a linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Linked List operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to the linked list, you adjust the pointers of the surrounding nodes. You can insert nodes at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list, depending on where you want to add the new element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node, you adjust the pointers of the preceding node (or the following node) to bypass the node being removed, thereby removing it from the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify:** To change the data in a node, locate the node and update its data field. You may also modify the links to adjust the node’s position in the list if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a specific element, start from the head node and traverse through the list, comparing each node’s data with the target value until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display:** To display all elements, start from the head node and follow the links, printing the data of each node until you reach the end of the list (where the link to the next node is `null`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists provide flexibility in managing collections of data and are particularly useful when the size of the collection changes frequently or when frequent insertions and deletions are required."

    "## Doubly Linked List\n",
    "A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains references to both the next node and the previous node in the sequence. This allows traversal in both forward and backward directions. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations; instead, each node contains references (or links) to both adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Structure:** Each node in a doubly linked list typically contains three parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Next (or Link):** A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "   - **Prev (or Previous Link):** A reference or pointer to the previous node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Head Node:** The first node in a doubly linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list and has no previous node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tail Node:** The last node in a doubly linked list is called the tail. It serves as the end of the list and has no next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Doubly Linked List operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to the doubly linked list, adjust the pointers of the surrounding nodes. You can insert nodes at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the list, depending on where you want to add the new element. Insertion requires updating both the `next` and `prev` pointers to maintain bidirectional linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node, adjust the pointers of both the preceding and following nodes to bypass the node being removed. This involves updating the `next` pointer of the node before the one being deleted and the `prev` pointer of the node after the one being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify:** To change the data in a node, locate the node and update its data field. The `next` and `prev` pointers will remain unchanged unless the node's position in the list is altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a specific element, start from the head node and traverse through the list, comparing each node’s data with the target value. Due to the doubly linked nature, you can also traverse backward from the tail node if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display:** To display all elements, start from the head node and follow the `next` links to print the data of each node until you reach the tail node. To traverse in reverse, start from the tail node and follow the `prev` links to print the data of each node until you reach the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doubly linked lists provide greater flexibility compared to singly linked lists, allowing for efficient bidirectional traversal and operations. They are particularly useful when both forward and backward navigation is needed, making them suitable for implementing complex data structures like deques."

    "## Circular Linked List\n",
    "A circular linked list is a variation of the linked list where the last node in the list points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This allows for continuous traversal through the list without encountering an end. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations; instead, each node contains a reference to the next node, and in a circular linked list, the last node references the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Structure:** Each node in a circular linked list typically contains two parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Next (or Link):** A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Head Node:** The first node in a circular linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tail Node:** The last node in the list, known as the tail, points back to the head, completing the circular linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Circular Linked List operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to the circular linked list, adjust the pointers of the surrounding nodes to include the new node. When inserting at the beginning, ensure the new node's `next` pointer points to the head node, and update the tail node’s `next` pointer to the new node. When inserting at the end, update the tail node's `next` pointer to the new node and set the new node's `next` pointer to the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node, adjust the pointers of the preceding and following nodes to bypass the node being removed. If removing the head node, update the tail node’s `next` pointer to the new head and set the new head’s `next` pointer to maintain the circular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify:** To change the data in a node, locate the node and update its data field. The `next` pointer will remain unchanged unless the node's position in the list is altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a specific element, start from the head node and traverse through the list, comparing each node’s data with the target value. Continue traversing until you return to the head node, ensuring you have checked all nodes in the circular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display:** To display all elements, start from the head node and follow the `next` links, printing the data of each node. Continue traversing until you return to the head node, ensuring that all nodes are visited exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular linked lists are useful in scenarios where the data needs to be accessed repeatedly in a circular fashion. They provide a seamless way to loop through the list without needing special conditions to handle the end of the list."

    "## Circular Doubly Linked List\n",
    "A circular doubly linked list is a variation of the doubly linked list where the last node's next pointer points back to the first node, and the first node's previous pointer points back to the last node. This structure combines the bidirectional traversal capabilities of a doubly linked list with the circular nature of a circular linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the linked list structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Node Structure:** Each node in a circular doubly linked list typically contains three parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Next (or Link):** A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.\n",
    "   - **Prev (or Previous Link):** A reference or pointer to the previous node in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Head Node:** The first node in a circular doubly linked list is called the head. It serves as the entry point to the list and has its `prev` pointer pointing to the tail node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tail Node:** The last node in the list, known as the tail, points back to the head node through its `next` pointer, and its `prev` pointer points to the node before it in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Circular Doubly Linked List operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to the circular doubly linked list, adjust the pointers of the surrounding nodes to include the new node. When inserting at the beginning, ensure the new node’s `next` pointer points to the head node and its `prev` pointer points to the tail node. Update the head node’s `prev` pointer to the new node, and the tail node’s `next` pointer to the new node. When inserting at the end, update the tail node’s `next` pointer to the new node and the new node’s `prev` pointer to the tail node. Also, update the new node’s `next` pointer to the head node and the head node’s `prev` pointer to the new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node, adjust the pointers of the preceding and following nodes to bypass the node being removed. If removing the head node, update the tail node’s `next` pointer to the new head and set the new head’s `prev` pointer to the tail node. If removing the tail node, update the head node’s `prev` pointer to the new tail and set the new tail’s `next` pointer to the head node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify:** To change the data in a node, locate the node and update its data field. The `next` and `prev` pointers will remain unchanged unless the node’s position in the list is altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a specific element, start from the head node and traverse through the list, comparing each node’s data with the target value. Continue traversing in both directions if needed until you return to the head node, ensuring all nodes are checked.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display:** To display all elements, start from the head node and follow the `next` links, printing the data of each node. Continue until you return to the head node, ensuring that all nodes are visited exactly once. For a reverse traversal, start from the tail node and follow the `prev` links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circular doubly linked lists provide a flexible and efficient way to traverse and manage data in both directions while maintaining a continuous loop. This structure is useful for applications requiring frequent bidirectional traversal and circular iteration."

    "## Hashing\n",
    "Hashing is a technique used in data structures to efficiently map data, such as keys, to specific locations in a hash table or hash map. This method provides fast access to data by converting keys into indexes of an array where the corresponding values are stored. Hashing is particularly useful for tasks like quick data retrieval, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how Hashing operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hash Function:** The core of hashing is the hash function, which takes an input (the key) and produces a fixed-size integer (the hash value). This hash value is used as an index in the hash table. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the table to minimize collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hash Table:** A hash table is an array-like data structure that stores data at specific positions determined by the hash value. Each position in the hash table is called a bucket or slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insertion:** To insert a key-value pair, the key is passed through the hash function, and the resulting hash value determines the index in the hash table where the value is stored. If the bucket at that index is empty, the key-value pair is inserted. If the bucket is already occupied (a collision occurs), a method like chaining or open addressing is used to resolve the collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a value associated with a key, the key is passed through the hash function to obtain the hash value. The hash value directs the search to a specific index in the hash table where the corresponding value should be stored. If there’s a collision, the resolution method used during insertion helps locate the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deletion:** To delete a key-value pair, the key is hashed to find the corresponding index in the hash table. The value at that index is then removed. If collision resolution was used during insertion, the deletion process might involve additional steps to ensure that other elements are still accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Collision Resolution:** Collisions occur when two keys produce the same hash value and thus point to the same index in the hash table. Common collision resolution methods include:\n",
    "   - **Chaining:** Each bucket in the hash table points to a linked list of entries that share the same hash index. When a collision occurs, the new entry is added to the linked list at that index.\n",
    "   - **Open Addressing:** When a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available bucket using a probing sequence. This can involve linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing to find an empty slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a powerful and efficient method for managing and accessing data, especially when quick lookups, insertions, and deletions are required. Its effectiveness depends heavily on the choice of hash function and collision resolution strategy."

    "#### Collision Resolution by Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision resolution by chaining is a technique used in hashing to handle situations where multiple keys hash to the same index in a hash table. This method utilizes a list of lists (or linked lists) to store multiple elements at the same hash table index, allowing for efficient insertion, search, and deletion even in the presence of collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we simplify the concept by treating each key (integer) as its own value, without associating it with a separate value. Instead of returning a value associated with a key, this method returns the position of the key within the hash table, indicating where it has been stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash Function:** The hash function used is straightforward, computing the index for storing a key by applying the modulus operation based on the size of the hash table. This means that the hash value determines the index of the cell where the key will be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Chaining Works:**\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** When a key is inserted, the hash function calculates the index where the key should be placed. If the calculated index is already occupied (i.e., another key already exists at that index), the key is added to a linked list (or another secondary data structure) at that index. This list allows multiple keys to be stored at the same hash table index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search:** To find a key, the hash function computes the index where the key should be located. The search process then traverses the linked list at that index to find the specific key. This approach ensures that even if multiple keys hash to the same index, the key can still be located.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion:** To delete a key, the hash function determines the index where the key is stored. The corresponding linked list at that index is then searched to locate and remove the key. This maintains the efficiency of the hash table by ensuring that removed keys do not interfere with other keys in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Collision Handling:** By storing colliding keys in a linked list at each index, chaining handles collisions effectively. This approach ensures that the hash table can accommodate multiple keys hashing to the same index without losing data or affecting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chaining is a versatile and effective method for managing collisions in hash tables, making it particularly useful in scenarios where hash collisions are frequent. It maintains the hash table's efficiency by providing a straightforward way to handle and resolve collisions while keeping insertion, search, and deletion operations efficient."

    "#### Collision Resolution by Open Addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision resolution by open addressing is a technique used in hashing to handle cases where multiple keys hash to the same index in a hash table. Unlike chaining, which stores all colliding keys at the same index using linked lists, open addressing resolves collisions by finding another open slot within the hash table where the key can be stored. This method ensures that each key is stored directly within the hash table itself, without the need for external data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we simplify the concept by considering each key as its own value, without associating it with a separate value. Instead of returning a value associated with a key, this method returns the position of the key within the hash table, indicating where it has been stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash Function:** The hash function calculates the initial index for storing a key by applying the modulus operation based on the size of the hash table. This index serves as the starting point for placing the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Open Addressing Works:**\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** When a key is inserted, the hash function computes the initial index where the key should be placed. If the index is already occupied by another key (i.e., a collision occurs), open addressing searches for the next available slot in the hash table. This search is done through a probing sequence, such as:\n",
    "   - **Linear Probing:** The algorithm checks the next sequential slot in the hash table (index + 1, index + 2, etc.) until an empty slot is found.\n",
    "   - **Quadratic Probing:** The algorithm checks slots at intervals that grow quadratically (index + 1^2, index + 2^2, etc.) to find an empty slot.\n",
    "   - **Double Hashing:** A secondary hash function is used to calculate the interval between probes, ensuring that the sequence of checks is varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search:** To find a key, the hash function computes the initial index where the key should be located. If the key is not found at that index, the probing sequence is followed to check the subsequent slots until the key is found or an empty slot is encountered, indicating that the key is not in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deletion:** To delete a key, the hash function determines the index where the key is stored. After locating the key (using the same probing sequence if necessary), the key is removed. However, to ensure that the probing sequence for other keys remains intact, the slot is typically marked as \"deleted\" (or rehashed), allowing future insertions and searches to function correctly without breaking the sequence.\n",

    "4. **Collision Handling:** Open addressing effectively handles collisions by ensuring that all keys are stored within the hash table itself. The probing sequence used determines how quickly an open slot is found and plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open addressing is an efficient collision resolution strategy that avoids the need for external storage like linked lists. It is particularly useful in situations where memory is constrained, as it ensures that all data is stored within the hash table itself. The choice of probing sequence is critical to the performance of open addressing, affecting how well it handles collisions and maintains fast access times."

    "## Binary Trees\n",
    "A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure provides an efficient way to organize and manage data hierarchically. Binary trees are widely used in various applications, including searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Binary Tree operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node Structure:** Each node in a binary tree typically contains three parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Left Child:** A reference or pointer to the left child node.\n",
    "   - **Right Child:** A reference or pointer to the right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root Node:** The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root. It is the entry point to the tree and does not have a parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subtrees:** Each node in a binary tree can have zero, one, or two children, resulting in a structure composed of subtrees. The left and right subtrees of a node are themselves binary trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how Binary Trees operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to a binary tree, locate the appropriate position based on the specific type of binary tree (e.g., binary search tree, complete binary tree). For a binary search tree, insert the new node in a way that maintains the property where left children are less than the parent node and right children are greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node, first locate it and then handle three possible cases:\n",
    "   - **No Children:** Simply remove the node.\n",
    "   - **One Child:** Remove the node and replace it with its child.\n",
    "   - **Two Children:** Replace the node with its in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree) or predecessor (the largest node in the left subtree), then remove the successor or predecessor node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify:** To change the data in a node, locate the node and update its data field. The structure of the tree remains unchanged unless nodes are inserted or deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search:** To find a specific value, start from the root and traverse the tree based on the value comparisons. For a binary search tree, compare the target value with the current node's data, moving to the left child if the target is smaller or to the right child if larger (Only valid for Binary Search Trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Traversal:** To visit all nodes in a binary tree, several traversal methods can be used:\n",
    "   - **In-Order Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.\n",
    "   - **Pre-Order Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.\n",
    "   - **Post-Order Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.\n",
    "   - **Level-Order Traversal:** Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom, typically using a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees come in various types, including:\n",
    "- **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where each node’s left children are smaller and right children are larger, allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree:** A binary tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees are fundamental in computer science, providing a versatile way to store and manage hierarchical data. They support efficient operations for a wide range of applications, from data storage and retrieval to sorting and hierarchical representation."

    "### DFS (Depth-First Search)\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far along a branch as possible before backtracking. In a binary tree, DFS can be performed in different ways depending on the order in which the nodes are visited. The three primary types of DFS traversal in binary trees are **In-Order**, **Pre-Order**, and **Post-Order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In-Order Traversal:**  \n",
    "   In an in-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the current node, and then the right subtree. This method is commonly used when the nodes in a binary search tree need to be visited in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-Order Traversal:**  \n",
    "   Pre-order traversal visits the current node first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. This method is often used for creating a copy of the tree or for prefix notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Post-Order Traversal:**  \n",
    "   In post-order traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the right subtree, and finally the current node. This method is useful when deleting nodes or when evaluating postfix expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS explores nodes by going as deep as possible in the left subtree, and then it backtracks to explore the right subtree. These traversal methods differ in the point at which the current node is processed during the traversal of its subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BFS (Breadth-First Search)\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal technique that explores nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving to each subsequent level of the tree. In binary trees, BFS is also referred to as **Level-Order Traversal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level-Order Traversal:**  \n",
    "In level-order traversal, the nodes are visited in order of their depth in the tree, from the root to the deepest level. All nodes at a given level are visited before moving on to the next level. This method is particularly useful when the tree needs to be explored layer by layer, such as in breadth-first search algorithms or when determining the shortest path in an unweighted tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS ensures that all nodes at each level are fully explored before descending to the next level, making it a more systematic approach compared to DFS. Both DFS and BFS have different use cases depending on the requirements of the operation being performed on the tree structure."

    "## Binary Search Trees (BST)\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specialized type of binary tree that maintains a specific ordering of its elements. In a BST, each node contains a value, and all values in the left subtree of a node are less than the node's value, while all values in the right subtree are greater. This property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how a Binary Search Tree operates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node Structure:** Each node in a binary search tree typically contains three parts:\n",
    "   - **Data:** The value or data the node holds.\n",
    "   - **Left Child:** A reference or pointer to the left child node.\n",
    "   - **Right Child:** A reference or pointer to the right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Root Node:** The topmost node in a BST is called the root. It serves as the entry point to the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subtrees:** Each node can have zero, one, or two children, forming left and right subtrees. The BST property must be maintained in all subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how Binary Search Trees operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion:** To add a new node to a BST, compare the value of the new node with the current node starting from the root. If the new value is less than the current node's value, move to the left child; if greater, move to the right child. Repeat this process until an empty position is found, and insert the new node there. This ensures the BST property is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deletion:** To remove a node from a BST, first locate the node to be deleted and handle three possible scenarios:\n",
    "   - **No Children (Leaf Node):** Simply remove the node.\n",
    "   - **One Child:** Remove the node and replace it with its child (left or right).\n",
    "   - **Two Children:** Find the in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree) or in-order predecessor (the largest node in the left subtree) to replace the node being deleted, and then remove the successor or predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Search:** To find a specific value, start at the root node and traverse the tree based on comparisons. If the target value is less than the current node's data, move to the left child; if greater, move to the right child. This process continues until the target is found or a leaf node is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search Trees offer several advantages, including:\n",
    "- **Efficient Searching:** The BST property allows for efficient searching, as each comparison skips about half of the tree, resulting in average-case logarithmic performance for balanced trees.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike arrays, BSTs can easily grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "BSTs are widely used in varius applications. To maintain efficient performance, it is crucial to keep the tree balanced, as unbalanced trees can degrade to linear structures, leading to poor performance. "

    "## Heaps\n",
    "A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which can be defined in two ways: a **max heap** and a **min heap**. Heaps are typically implemented as binary trees and are commonly used to implement priority queues. They can be efficiently represented using an array, which simplifies the storage and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Structure\n",
    "In a heap implemented using an array, each element in the array represents a node in the binary tree. The relationship between parent and child nodes is maintained by the following index relationships:\n",
    "- For any element at index `i`:\n",
    "  - The left child is located at index `2i + 1`.\n",
    "  - The right child is located at index `2i + 2`.\n",
    "  - The parent is located at index `(i - 1) // 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "Heaps possess specific properties depending on whether they are max heaps or min heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Max Heap:** In a max heap, the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the maximum element is always at the root of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Min Heap:** In a min heap, the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This ensures that the minimum element is always at the root of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of heaps are complete binary trees, meaning all levels of the tree are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Heaps Operate\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heapify:** The heapify operation is used to restore the heap property. After inserting a new element, this operation ensures that the heap property is maintained by moving the element upwards in the tree until it is in the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build Heap:** The build heap operation creates a heap from an unordered array. This is done by applying the heapify down operation starting from the last non-leaf node down to the root node. By performing heapify down on each node in reverse level order, the entire array can be rearranged into a valid heap structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Heaps are an essential data structure used for efficiently managing prioritized data. Their array implementation allows for compact storage and quick access to elements based on priority. By maintaining the heap property through operations like insertion, heaps provide an effective way to implement priority queues and other applications requiring efficient access to the minimum or maximum element."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude a Jupyter Notebook on data structures covering stacks, queues, linked lists, hashing, binary trees, and heaps, it's important to highlight the fundamental concepts and their practical applications. Each data structure serves a unique purpose, and understanding their behavior helps in choosing the right one for various computational problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack and Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "A **stack** is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure, essential for tasks that involve backtracking, like evaluating expressions or managing function calls in recursion. Its primary operations—push, pop, and peek—provide efficient ways to handle a dynamic set of elements with well-defined access patterns. In contrast, a **queue** operates on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which is useful for modeling real-world scenarios like task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search in graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving into linked structures, a **singly linked list** is a flexible, linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions and deletions, though access time can be slower due to sequential traversal. **Doubly linked lists** improve upon this by allowing traversal in both directions, offering more flexibility at the cost of additional memory overhead. A **circular linked list** connects the last node back to the first, creating a continuous loop that is useful for cyclic data processing tasks, such as in round-robin scheduling. The **circular doubly linked list** combines the advantages of both circular and doubly linked structures, enabling bidirectional traversal in a circular setup, providing versatility in certain circular buffer or resource management scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "In **hashing**, we see a key data structure for fast data retrieval, where a **hash function** maps keys to index positions in an array (hash table). Collisions, when two keys map to the same index, are resolved by techniques like **chaining** (using linked lists at each bucket) or **open addressing** (probing for the next available slot). Hashing is crucial for efficient search operations, often used in databases and caching systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary trees** introduce a hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, which serves as a foundation for more specialized trees. A **binary search tree (BST)** builds on this by organizing data such that left children are smaller than the parent, and right children are larger, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion. However, unbalanced trees can degrade performance, which is why variations like AVL or Red-Black trees are used to maintain balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, **heaps** are binary trees that follow the heap property. In a **max heap**, each parent node is larger than its children, whereas in a **min heap**, each parent is smaller. Heaps are typically implemented using arrays for simplicity and are heavily used in priority queues and algorithms like heap sort. Key operations include inserting elements while maintaining the heap property, and removing the root (either the maximum or minimum element), followed by reorganizing the structure through **heapify**. Building a heap from an unordered array uses the **build heap** operation, allowing efficient heap construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Each of these data structures plays a vital role in different algorithmic contexts, offering tailored solutions to efficiently manage, access, and modify data. Understanding their inner workings, strengths, and trade-offs is fundamental to writing optimal code and solving complex problems in computer science and software development.*"
