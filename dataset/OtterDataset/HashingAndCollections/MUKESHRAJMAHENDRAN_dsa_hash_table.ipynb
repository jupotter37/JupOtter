    "# Introduction to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a huge bookshelf (like, Hogwarts library size). You've got a new book and need to find a spot for it and later on, search it quickly every time you need it. Instead of scanning the whole shelf, you use a magical spell that tells you exactly where to place or find it. This magical spell takes the book's title and gives you a specific location, like \"4th shelf, 10th spot\". But remember! Even if you slightly change the book's title, the spell gives a completely different spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's map this to computer science:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashing:** It's a technique that takes an input (or 'message') and returns a fixed-size string, which looks random. The output, known as the hash value, is unique (mostly) to the given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash Function:** This is our \"magical spell\" that converts the input data (like our book title) into a fixed-length value.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, no magic is perfect. If two different inputs give the same hash, that's called a collision. It's like our spell accidentally pointing to the same spot for two different books. Good hash functions make these super rare. We will discuss this in detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is hashing important? Let's find out!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a great tool to quickly access, protect, and verify data. Here are a few of the common use cases of hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Data Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing helps in accessing data super fast. With it, systems can quickly find a data piece without searching the whole database or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Integrity Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "When downloading a file from the web, the site may provide you with a hash value for that file. If even a tiny portion of that file changes during the download, its hash will differ. By comparing the provided hash with the hash of the downloaded file, you can determine whether the file is exactly as the original, or if it was tampered with during the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Password Security\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of storing actual passwords, systems store their hash. It's like locking the real magical item away and just keeping a hologram on display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is used in programming for efficient data structures like hash tables. It’s like having organized shelves for our books where each item has its designated spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Some hash functions are used in cryptography to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. It's like a spell that only allows certain wizards to read a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Deduplication\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're saving data, and you don’t want duplicates, you can just compare their hashes. Same hash? It’s the same data. It ensures you're not wasting space with repeated magical items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "In big systems serving many users, hashes can be used to decide which server should handle a particular request. It's like deciding which magical portal to send a wizard based on their wand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing has numerous applications in several practical domains. However, this section tries to cover Hashing for defining and implementing a retrieval efficient data structure called Hash Table, which will be our next lesson."

    "## First Non-repeating Character (easy)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string, identify the position of the first character that appears only once in the string. If no such character exists, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** \"apple\"\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** 0\n",
    "- **Justification:** The first character 'a' appears only once in the string and is the first character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** \"abcab\"\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** 2\n",
    "- **Justification:** The first character that appears only once is 'c' and its position is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** \"abab\"\n",
    "- **Expected Output:** -1\n",
    "- **Justification:** There is no character in the string that appears only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( 1 \\leq s.\\text{length} \\leq 10^5 \\)\n",
    "- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll use a hashmap to keep a record of each character in the string and the number of times it appears. First, iterate through the string and populate the hashmap with each character as the key and its frequency as the value. Then, go through the string again, this time checking each character against the hashmap. The first character that has a frequency of one (indicating it doesn't repeat) is your target. This character is the first non-repeating character in the string. If no such character exists, the solution should indicate that as well. This two-pass approach ensures efficiency, as each character is checked against a pre-compiled frequency map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Begin by creating a hashmap to store the frequency of each character in the string. This hashmap will help in identifying characters that appear only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frequency Count:** Traverse the string from the beginning to the end. For each character, increment its count in the hashmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **First Unique Character:** Traverse the string again from the beginning. For each character, check its frequency in the hashmap. If the frequency is 1, return its position as it's the first unique character.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Unique Character:** If the string is traversed completely without finding a unique character, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a hashmap ensures that we can quickly determine the frequency of each character without repeatedly scanning the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the input string \"abcab\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a hashmap** to store character frequencies.\n",
    "2. **Traverse the string:**\n",
    "   - 'a' -> frequency is 1\n",

    "   - 'a' has frequency 2\n",
    "   - 'b' has frequency 2\n",
    "   - 'c' has frequency 1, so return its position 2.\n",

    "To solve this problem, you start by creating a hashmap to count the frequency of each letter in the given string. Since the word \"balloon\" contains specific letters with varying frequencies (like 'l' and 'o' appearing twice), you need to account for these in your hashmap. Once you have the frequency of each letter, the next step is to determine how many times you can form the word \"balloon\". This is done by finding the minimum number of times each letter in \"balloon\" appears in the hashmap. The limiting factor will be the letter with the minimum frequency ratio to its requirement in the word \"balloon\". This approach ensures a balance between utilizing the available letters and adhering to the letter composition of \"balloon\".\n",

    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Given a string, determine the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed using the characters from the string. Return the maximum possible length of the palindromic string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input:** \"applepie\"\n",
    "  **Expected Output:** 5\n",
    "  **Justification:** The longest palindrome that can be constructed from the string is \"pepep\", which has a length of 5. There are other palindromes too but they all will be of length 5.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Input:** \"aabbcc\"\n",
    "  **Expected Output:** 6\n",
    "  **Justification:** We can form the palindrome \"abccba\" using the characters from the string, which has a length of 6.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Input:** \"bananas\"\n",
    "  **Expected Output:** 5\n",
    "  **Justification:** The longest palindrome that can be constructed from the string is \"anana\", which has a length of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= s.length <= 2000\n",
    "- s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. The idea is to use pairs of characters to form the palindrome. For example, if a character appears an even number of times, we can use all of them in the palindrome. If a character appears an odd number of times, we can use all except one of them in the palindrome. Additionally, if there's any character that appears an odd number of times, we can use one of them as the center of the palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start by initializing a hashmap to keep track of the characters and their frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Character Counting:** Iterate through the string and populate the hashmap with the frequency of each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Palindrome Length Calculation:** For each character in the hashmap, if it appears an even number of times, add its count to the palindrome length. If it appears an odd number of times, add its count minus one to the palindrome length. Also, set a flag indicating that there's a character available for the center of the palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Adjustment:** If the center flag is set, add one to the palindrome length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialize a HashMap:**\n",
    "  We'll use a hashmap to store the frequency of each character in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Populate the HashMap:**\n",
    "  For the string \"bananas\", our hashmap will look like this:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  b: 1\n",
    "  a: 3\n",
    "  n: 2\n",
    "  s: 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Determine Palindrome Length:**\n",
    "  - **Even Frequencies:** For characters with even frequencies, we can use all of them in the palindrome. For our string, the character 'n' has an even frequency. 'n' can contribute 2 characters. So far, we have a contribution of 2 characters to the palindrome.\n",
    "  - **Odd Frequencies:** For characters with odd frequencies, we can use all but one of them in the palindrome. The central character of the palindrome can be any character with an odd frequency. For our string, characters 'b', 'a', and 's' have odd frequencies.\n",
    "    - 'b' can contribute 0 characters (leaving out 1).\n",
    "    - 'a' can contribute 2 characters (leaving out 1).\n",
    "    - 's' can contribute 0 characters (leaving out 1).\n",
    "    Additionally, one of the characters left out from the odd frequencies can be used as the central character of the palindrome. Let's use 'a' for this purpose.\n",
    "    So, from the odd frequencies, we have a contribution of 2 characters to the palindrome, plus 1 for the central character.\n",
    "  - **Total Length:** Combining the contributions from even and odd frequencies, we get a total palindrome length of 2 (from even frequencies) + 3 (from odd frequencies) = 5.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The longest palindrome that can be constructed from \"bananas\" is of length 5.\n",

    "Given two strings, one representing a ransom note and the other representing the available letters from a magazine, determine if it's possible to construct the ransom note using only the letters from the magazine. Each letter from the magazine can be used only once.\n",

First, we iterate through the magazine, updating the hashmap with the count of each character. Then, we go through the ransom note. For each character in the note, we check if it exists in the hashmap and if its count is greater than zero. If it is, we decrease the count in the hashmap, indicating that we've used that letter. If at any point we find a character in the note that isn't available in sufficient quantity in the magazine, we return false.
