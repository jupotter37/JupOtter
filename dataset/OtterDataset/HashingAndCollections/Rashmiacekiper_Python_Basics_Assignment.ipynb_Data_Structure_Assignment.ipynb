        "\n",
        "Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed. This is useful when you want to store data that should remain constant throughout the program, like fixed configuration values or records that shouldn't be modified.\n",

        " (b) Heterogeneous Data:\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples can store different types of data (e.g., strings, numbers, lists), making them useful when you need to represent diverse data types together in a single, ordered collection.\n",

        "A common use of tuples is to return multiple values from a function. Since tuples can store multiple elements, they are an efficient way to bundle related data and return it from a function.\n",

        "# 8. Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This is a crucial characteristic of dictionaries and directly impacts how they are implemented and used. Immutable objects, such as strings, numbers, and tuples, can be used as dictionary keys, while mutable objects like lists and dictionaries themselves cannot be.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Dictionary Keys Must Be Immutable:\n",
        "(a) Hashing Requirement:\n",
        "\n",
        "A dictionary in Python is implemented as a hash table. This means that the dictionary uses a hash function to assign a unique \"hash value\" to each key, which allows for fast lookups.\n",
        "To ensure this hash value is consistent and reliable, the key must be immutable. If a key were mutable, its hash value could change after it is inserted into the dictionary, which would break the hash tableâ€™s integrity and make lookups unreliable.\n",
        "(b) Consistency of Key Identity:\n",
        "\n",
        "The identity of a dictionary key must remain constant during the lifetime of the dictionary. If the keyâ€™s value can change (i.e., it is mutable), the keyâ€™s identity can change, which would disrupt the dictionaryâ€™s internal structure.\n",
        "For example, if a dictionary used a list as a key, and the list was modified after being added as a key, it would lead to unpredictable behavior when trying to retrieve the associated value.\n",
        "(c) Performance and Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutability allows the dictionary to optimize its operations, particularly for quick lookups. Since the keyâ€™s value doesnâ€™t change, the hash value remains the same, ensuring that dictionary operations (insert, update, lookup) are efficient and stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importance of Immutable Keys:\n",
        "Hash Consistency: Immutable keys guarantee that their hash value does not change, ensuring consistent and reliable dictionary operations.\n",
        "Unpredictability Avoidance: Mutable keys could lead to unpredictable behavior because their identity (and thus their hash value) could change over time.\n",
        "Performance Optimization: Immutability allows Python dictionaries to efficiently manage key-value pairs using hash tables, ensuring fast lookups, additions, and deletions.\n",
        "Immutability of dictionary keys is fundamental for the stability, reliability, and performance of the dictionary data structure. Only immutable objectsâ€”such as strings, numbers, and tuplesâ€”can be used as keys, which helps avoid issues that would arise from the potential modification of the key during its lifetime."
