A major advance introduced with the 3330 was the use of error correction , which makes the drives more reliable and reduced costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated .

       " 'CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems . It is a special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system \\'s DOS BIOS ( typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS ) during boot . CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0 . The directives in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system . After processing the CONFIG.SYS file , DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the SHELL line of CONFIG.SYS , or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line . In fact , these will either define some tunable parameters often resulting in reservation of memory , or load files , mostly device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs ( TSRs ) , into memory . In DOS , CONFIG.SYS is located in the root directory of the drive from which the system was booted . The filename is also used by ( DCP ) , an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron . Some versions of DOS will probe for alternative filenames taking precedence over the default CONFIG.SYS filename if they exist : While older versions of Concurrent DOS 3.2 to 4.1 did not support CONFIG.SYS files at all , later versions of Concurrent DOS 386 and Concurrent DOS XM , as well as Multiuser DOS , System Manager and REAL/32 will probe for CCONFIG.SYS ( with \" C \" derived from \" Concurrent \" ) instead of CONFIG.SYS . Some versions of MultiuserDOS use a filename of CCONFIG.INI instead , whereas REAL/32 is known to look for MCONFIG.SYS . These operating systems support many additional and different configuration settings ( like INIT_INSTALL ) not known under MS-DOS/PCDOS , but they are stored in the binary repository named CCONFIG.BIN rather than in CCONFIG.INI . Since DRDOS6.0 this was used in conjunction with disk compression software , where the original boot driveC : would become driveD : after loading the compression driver ( and the \" D \" in the file name came in handy as well ) , but it is commonly used to help maintain multiple configuration files in multi-boot scenarios . For example , with SYS /L /DR:703 the written Volume Boot Record would look for a renamed and modified IBMBIO.703 system file ( instead of the default IBMBIO.COM ) and the IBMBIO.703 would look for IBMDOS.703 and [D]CONFIG.703 ( instead of IBMDOS.COM and [D]CONFIG.SYS ) , so that multiple parallel sets of files can coexist in the same root directory and be selected via a boot-loader like LOADER , supplied with Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 . The SHELL directive is enhanced to provide means to specify alternative AUTOEXEC.BAT files via /P[:filename.ext] and in this specific scenario , COMMAND.COM will accept file extensions other than \" .BAT \" as well ( both features are also supported by 4DOS ) . Under DRDOS6.0 and higher , the CONFIG.SYS directive CHAIN = filespec can be used to continue processing in the named file , which does not necessarily need to reside in the root directory of the boot drive . DR-DOS 7.03 and higher support a new SYS /A parameter in order to copy the corresponding CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files along with the system files . FreeDOS implements a similar feature with its FDCONFIG.SYS configuration file . PTS-DOS uses CONFIG.PTS . Both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found included in the root folder of Windows 95 , and Windows 98 boot drives , as they are based on DOS . Windows ME does not even parse the CONFIG.SYS file during the Windows boot process , loading environment variables from the Windows Registry instead : Under FlexOS , CONFIG.SYS is a binary file defining the resource managers and device drivers loaded . ( Under MS-DOS/PCDOS the inline-comment is not ignored if put in double-quotes . ) ( FreeDOS does not support optional messages , but optional conditions in conjunction with boot menus defined with and . ) ( DOS 6.0 and higher supports a similar feature by adding a after the corresponding CONFIG.SYS directive , f.e. Configures which drives should store file access date stamps in the reserved area of directory entries in FAT file systems . Changes internal default serial device driver ( to ) for device . Loads base device driver into memory . Specifies operating system to be booted . Same as , but explicitly loads buffers into HMA or UMB ( like under DR DOS 6.0 and higher ) . Similar to under DOS , loads programs in CONFIG.SYS . Similar to under OS/2 , but runs in foreground and halts CONFIG.SYS processing until return . Specifies the name of the CD-ROM hardware driver . Continues CONFIG.SYS processing in new file and ( since DR-DOS 7.02 ) at optional label . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM1 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM2 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM3 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM4 : device . Loads a device driver into memory . Loads a device driver into upper memory . Configures country and codepage information for KBD , SCR , LPT1 , LPT2 , LPT3 devices . Specifies whether to load DOS into the high memory area and/or use upper memory . Specifies whether to load DOS tables ( , , , , ) into upper memory . Specifies alternative path to search for DOS files . Works considerably differently from the external MS-DOS/PCDOS FASTOPEN driver . Specifies the number of cached FCBs that can be opened at once . ( Under DR-DOS , and dynamically share the same internal buffer . ) Same as , but explicitly loads FCBs into upper memory . Waits for key ( or timeout ) and sets error level to its ASCII code ( or 1024 on timeout ) . Installs a TSR program into memory , like , but installs after the DOS data segment relocation .
