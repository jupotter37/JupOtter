    "## Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure used to store keys, optionally, with corresponding values. Inserts, deletes and lookups tun in $O(1)$ time on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underlying idea**: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Store the keys in an array.\n",
    "    * The location of the key in the array is based on its \"hash code\".\n",
    "    * The **hash code** is an **integer** computed from the key by a hash function.\n",
    "* If two keys map to the same location, a \"collision\" is said to occur.\n",
    "    * To deal with collisions, one maintains a linked list of objects at each array location.\n",
    "* If the hash function does a good job of spreading objects across the underlying array and take $O(1)$ time to compute\n",
    "    * on average, **lookups**, **insertions**, and **deletions** have $O(1+n/m)$ time complexity\n",
    "        * n = number of objects\n",
    "        * m = length of the array\n",
    "    * When $n/m$ grows large, rehashing can be applied (larger number of locations is allocated, and the objects are moved to the new array) which takes $O(n+m)$ time. \n",
    "        * If rehashing is done infrequently, its amortized cost is low.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### The Hard Requirement of a Hash Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Equal keys should have equal hash codes. It is easy to get wrong, e.g., by writing a hash function that is based on address rather than contents, or by including profiling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Softer Requirement of a Hash Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash function should spread keys, i.e., the hash codes for a subset of objects should be uniformly distributed across the underlying array. In addition, a hash function should be efficient to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing a Hash Function Suitable for Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "* The hash function should examine all the characters in the string.\n",
    "* It should give a large range of values\n",
    "* It should not let one character dominate (e.g., if we simply cast characters to integers and multiplied them, a single $0$ would result in a hash code of $0$).\n",
    "* We would also like a rolling hash function, one in which if a character is deleted from the front of the string, and another added to the end, the new hash code can be computed in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following function has these properties:\n"
