    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1), constant. \n"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "\n",
    "I first discovered the song when I was in 2nd grade. Every Tuesday, I would ride a bus early in the morning to my before-school program. I remember each time I would ride the bus, Blank Space would play on the bus radio. I clearly remember each time I would lean my head agains the bus window and hum along to the song because I thought it was really catchy. For a long time, I didn't know what the name of the song was and I was trying to find it by searching up the lyrics.  Specifically, I remember thinking that the \"got a long list of ex-lovers\" part was something about Starbucks... so whenever I searched this up I couldn't find what song it was. However, I finally finally found out the name of the song by watching the Blank Space YouTube video. Blank Space was the first Taylor Swift song I encountered, and after finding out the name, I got more into her music.\n",

    "I used to be a big fan of Taylor Swift when I was younger, especially in elementary school. Though my music taste has changed over the years and I'm not too much of a \"Swiftie\" these days, several of my friends LOVE Taylor Swift. I often sing or listen along with my friends when they play her songs. And whenever I hear Blank Space, it's very reminiscing and nostalgic for me. It definitely reminds me of the \"good old days\" (even though I'm not even that old)... listening to it on the bus is a very core memory for me.\n"
