    "# The A-Z of Python Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries are great. Once you learn how to use them, its clear that they are a versatile, easy-to-use, efficient data strucutre. But its not just covenience. Dictioanries are core to how Python works under the hood. Module namespaces, class and inheritance attributes, and function keywork arguments all live inside dictionaries. Understanding how you can leveraging dictionaries to their maximum potential is essential in becoming a Pythonista.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might a few things you don't know about Python dictionaries, so lets see if I can teach you something. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will first cover a few tricks to take your dictionary game to the next level, then I will dive into the juicy CPython implementation of dictionaries, so we can understand the practical consequences of how they actually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll assume you know the basics. If you don't, check out the great tutorals at [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm) or [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNRc6c0wUA8). I'll help take that knowledge to the next level. The basic idea is that this data structure with keys and values, where each key is a unique string, and the values can be any object. New to Python 3.6, dictionaries keep their ordering from creation. "

    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, now that hashes are out of the way, you might not be surprised to learn that Python dictionaries and sets use hashes (in the form of hash tables). A hash table is a sparse array (an array with empty cells). Each cell of a hash table is sometimes called a \"bucket\", so we'll use that terminology. For a `dict`, there is a bucket for each item, with two fields: a reference to the key, and a reference to the value. Note: this is a reference pointer, not the actual object! This is important, because no matter what object that referece is pointing to, the reference itself has the same size, so we can index the `dict` hashtable using offsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/hashmap.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the Python interpreter will try to keep 1/3 of the buckets empty, and copy over the data to a larger `dict` if the preallocated space fills up. The reason for the sparsity is becasue scattering around the hash indices makes retrieval faster, as we will see. Ideally, keys with similar but different semantic values (ex. 'Mary' vs. 'Marie') will create very different hashses, and hashes which *are* similar will be far away from each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does retrieval actually work? Well if we call `d['key']`, where `d` is a `dict`, then a hash is computed of `key`, and the \"least significant\" part of that hash is used to locate a bucket in the hash table. The beginning of the hash is the most significant, and the end is the least, so here maybe the last 3 characters were used. Only part of the hash is used so that there is a smaller field of numbers to compare for a match. If nothing is found, a `KeyError` is raised. If there is a match, then the found value is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you may have spotted an error here. Only **part** of the hash is used. And since the hash function maps an arbitrary number of objects to a finite number of hash values, that means we can, and very often do, get conflicts where two partial hashes match in a given table, but the full hashes do not match. This is called a hash collision, and its not good. Its why the hash table is a sparse array, to try and avoid these conflicts. If a hash conflict does occur, then a different part of the hash is used for comparisons, and this is repeated until a found value is returned, or a `KeyError` is raised. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/dict_flowchart.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho\">\n",
    "\n",
    "So to recap, using the partial hash is a way to make this retrieval faster, at the cost of collisions. Collisions are kept to a minimum by using a sparse hash table. If a collision occurs, a different part of the hash is used for retrieval. This process is repeated till a sucessful retrieval or a failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process for updating a dictionary is the same, except when an empty bucket is found, the new value is put there, instead of a `KeyError`. And when a bucket is found as an exact match, it is overwritten with the new value. Additionally, when inserting new values, if the 1/3 threshold of sparsity is exceeded, then the hash table is rebuilt to be bigger, and a larger part of the hash is used for the partial-indexing. This keeps the rate of collisions low. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Consequences: Space, Time, and Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds more complicated that necessary, in reality, collisions are quite low, with between 0-2 collisions per search on average. The true benefit is that Understanding how `dict` works gives some insights in how to properly use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Space inefficency \n",
    "2. Time effiency\n",
    "3. Order impermanance\n",
    "\n",
    "The first insight is that dictionaries are not memory efficient. Since the are 2/3 sparse, the uses 66% more space then the actual data we use them for. If you have a large list of records, a list of tuples or named tuples might be the best data structure, since you can avoid the overhead of hash tables and using the name field. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, the high cost of space is a trade off for the low cost of speed. As long as your `dict` fits into memory, it will have fast access to the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a dictionary outgrows itself, it needs to get resized to maintain its sparsity. The practical consequences of this are that order is not retained before and after resizing. This means that iterating over a dictionary and adding or deleting items can be dangerous! \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#dont do this!\n",
    "for k, v in d.items():\n",
    "    if v < 10:\n",
    "        del d[k] \n",
    "        \n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "File \"<stdin>\", line  1,in module\n",
    "RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that `sets` use the same hash table infrastructure as `dict`s, except the only hold one reference, the value, and have no keys. Sets are great for creating an array of values where each value is unique, and there are no duplicates (since hash collisions would prevent this).  \n",
