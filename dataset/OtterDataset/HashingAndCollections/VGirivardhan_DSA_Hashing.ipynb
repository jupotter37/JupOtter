    "## Introduction to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to design a system for storing employee records with phone numbers (as keys). And we want the following queries to be performed efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert a phone number and corresponding information.\n",
    "2. Search a phone number and fetch the information.\n",
    "3. Delete a phone number and related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the time complexity is O(1) for the above operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of using the following data structures to maintain information about different phone numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Array of phone numbers and records.\n",
    "2. Linked List of phone numbers and records.\n",
    "3. Balanced binary search tree with phone numbers as keys.\n",
    "4. Direct Access Table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For arrays and linked lists, we need to search in a linear fashion, which can be costly in practice. If we use arrays and keep the data sorted, then a phone number can be searched in O(log n) time using Binary Search, but insert and delete operations become costly as we have to maintain sorted order.\n",

    "### Basic Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HashTable:** This operation is used to create a new hash table.\n",
    "- **Delete:** This operation is used to delete a particular key-value pair from the hash table.\n",
    "- **Get:** This operation is used to search a key inside the hash table and return the value associated with that key.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Applications of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing provides constant time search, insert, and delete operations on average. This efficiency makes hashing one of the most widely used data structures. Example problems include finding distinct elements, counting frequencies of items, and detecting duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous applications of hashing, including modern-day cryptographic hash functions. Some of these applications are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Message Digest:** Hash functions are used to produce a fixed-size string of bytes from input data, commonly used for data integrity verification and digital signatures.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Password Verification:** Hashing is used to securely store passwords by converting them into hash values, ensuring confidentiality even if the hash is compromised.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Data Structures (Programming Languages):** Hash tables are fundamental data structures used in programming languages for implementing associative arrays, sets, and maps, enabling efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Compiler Operation:** Hashing techniques are employed in compilers for symbol table management, facilitating quick retrieval and manipulation of identifiers, keywords, and other language constructs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm:** This string-searching algorithm utilizes hashing for substring matching, enabling efficient pattern searching within text documents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. **Linking File Name and Path Together:** Hashing can be used to generate unique identifiers or checksums for file names and paths, aiding in file management and ensuring data integrity.\n",

    "### Direct Address Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Address Table is a data structure that maps records to their corresponding keys using arrays. In direct address tables, records are placed using their key values directly as indexes, facilitating fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can understand the concept using the following example. We create an array of size equal to the maximum value plus one (assuming 0-based index) and then use values as indexes. For example, in the following diagram, key 21 is used directly as an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Direct Address Table](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/hmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Searching in O(1) Time:** Direct address tables use arrays, which are random access data structures. Thus, the key values (also the index of the array) can be easily used to search the records in O(1) time.\n",
    "- **Insertion in O(1) Time:** Inserting an element in an array takes O(1) time. The same principle applies to direct address tables.\n",
    "- **Deletion in O(1) Time:** Deletion of an element also takes O(1) time in an array. Similarly, deleting an element in a direct address table requires O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prior Knowledge of Maximum Key Value:** Direct address tables require knowledge of the maximum key value in advance.\n",
    "- **Practical Usefulness Limited:** They are practically useful only if the maximum value is very small.\n",
    "- **Memory Space Wastage:** Direct address tables may waste memory space if there is a significant difference between total records and the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing can overcome these limitations of direct address tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling Collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions can be handled similarly to hashing. Either chaining or open addressing can be used to handle collisions. The key difference from hashing is that direct address tables do not use a hash function to find the index; instead, they directly use values as indexes.\n",

    "### Hashing Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys and values into a hash table using a hash function. Its purpose is to enable faster access to elements. The efficiency of this mapping largely depends on the effectiveness of the hash function employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mod Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mod method for creating hash functions, we map a key into one of the slots of the table by taking the remainder of the key divided by the table size. Mathematically, the hash function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    " h(key) = key % table_size\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the list of values is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], they will be stored at positions {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the array or hash table, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hashing DataStructure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/HashingDataStructure-min.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "37599 % 17 = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for key = 573, its hash function is also:\n",
    "\n",
    "573 % 17 = 12\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiplication Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multiplication method, we multiply the key k by a constant real number c in the range 0 < c < 1 and extract the fractional part of k * c. Then we multiply this value by the table size m and take the floor of the result. This can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "h(k) = floor (m * (k * c mod 1))\n",
    "                     or\n",
    "h(k) = floor (m * frac (k * c))\n",
    "\n",
    "This method aims to distribute the keys more uniformly across the hash table, reducing the likelihood of collisions and improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "These hashing functions play a critical role in the efficiency and effectiveness of hash tables, impacting the speed and reliability of operations such as insertion, search, and deletion.\n",

    "### Collision Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision Handling: Since a hash function maps large keys to a small range of values, there's a possibility that two keys result in the same hash value. When a newly inserted key maps to an already occupied slot in the hash table, it results in a collision, which must be handled using a collision handling technique. Here are some common methods to handle collisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chaining:\n",
    "Chaining involves making each cell of the hash table point to a linked list of records that have the same hash function value. This method is simple but requires additional memory outside the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Addressing:\n",
    "In open addressing, all elements are stored in the hash table itself. Each table entry contains either a record or NIL. When searching for an element, we examine the table slots one by one until the desired element is found or it's clear that the element is not in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separate Chaining:\n",
    "Separate chaining is implemented by using a linked list as a chain. When multiple elements are hashed into the same slot index, they are inserted into a singly-linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "Consider a simple hash function as “key mod 7” and a sequence of keys as 50, 700, 76, 85, 92, 73, 101.\n",
    "\n",
    "![hashChaining](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2015/07/hashChaining1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Addressing:\n",
    "Open addressing, like separate chaining, is a method for handling collisions. Here, all elements are stored in the hash table itself. The size of the table must be greater than or equal to the total number of keys. This approach is also known as closed hashing and is based upon probing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Probing:**\n",
    "   In linear probing, the hash table is searched sequentially starting from the original location of the hash. If a location is occupied, the next location is checked. The rehash function used is rehash(key) = (n+1) % table_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The function used for rehashing is as follows: rehash(key) = (n+1)%table-size. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quadratic Probing:**\n",
    "   Quadratic probing solves the problem of clustering by increasing the interval between probes proportionally to the hash value. It looks for the i^2th slot in the ith iteration, starting from the original hash location.\n",
    "   let hash(x) be the slot index computed using hash function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If slot hash(x) % S is full, then we try (hash(x) + 1*1) % S\n",
    "\n",
    "If (hash(x) + 1*1) % S is also full, then we try (hash(x) + 2*2) % S\n",
    "\n",
    "If (hash(x) + 2*2) % S is also full, then we try (hash(x) + 3*3) % S\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Double Hashing:**\n",
    "   Double hashing reduces clustering by using another hash function to compute the increments for the probing sequence. It computes the increments using another hash function hash2(x) and looks for the i*hash2(x) slot in the i th rotation.\n",

    "   - If the slot is already occupied, handle the collision by finding the next empty slot and inserting the key there.\n",

    "- \\(4\\%10=4\\), so \\(4\\) goes to slot \\(4\\). \\(14\\%10=4\\). But \\(4\\) is already occupied so we make a linked list at this position and add \\(14\\) after \\(4\\) in slot \\(4\\) and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Finding Difference of Sets in Python**\n",

    "#### Python Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary in Python is a collection of keys and values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types that hold only a single value as an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Dictionary in Python \n",
    "A dictionary holds key-value pairs. Key-Value pairs are provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. \n",

    "In Python, a dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by commas. A dictionary holds pairs of values, where one element is the key and the other corresponding element is its value. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** – Dictionary keys are case-sensitive, meaning the same name but different cases of a key will be treated distinctly. \n",
