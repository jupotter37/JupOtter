    "# 1. Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ans:-  String slicing is a technique in Python used to access a range of characters within a string. \n",
    "#        This is achieved by specifying a start index, an end index, and an optional step value. The general syntax for string slicing is:\n",
    "#        string[start:stop:step]\n",
    "#        Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "#        start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
    "#        stop: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
    "#        step: The step size or stride between each index in the slice (optional, default is 1).\n",
    "# Examples:-\n",
    "# 1. Slicing with start and stop:\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(text[0:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
    "# This slice starts at index 0 and stops before index 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Slicing with start, stop, and step: \n",
    "print(text[0:5:2])  # Output: Hlo\n",
    "# This slice starts at index 0, stops before index 5, and takes every 2nd character.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Slicing with negative indices:\n",
    "print(text[-6:])  # Output: World!\n",
    "#This slice starts 6 characters from the end and goes to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Slicing with omitted start or stop:\n",
    "print(text[:5])  # Output: Hello\n",
    "print(text[7:])  # Output: World!\n",
    "print(text[:])   # Output: Hello, World!\n",

    "#If both are omitted, it includes the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Slicing with negative step:\n",
    "print(text[::-1])  # Output: !dlroW ,olleH\n",

    "#       Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Ordered Collection:\n",
    "#    Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added. This means that elements can be accessed by their position (index) \n",
    "#    in the list.\n",
    "numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Mutable\n",
    "#    Lists are mutable, which means that you can modify their content after they are created. You can change elements, add new elements,\n",
    "#    or remove elements. \n",
    "numbers[1] = 25\n",

    "# 6. Comprehensions\n",
    "#    List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. \n",
    "#    They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause.\n",

    "# 8. Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ans:- In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable because they are used as identifiers to store and retrieve data efficiently. \n",
    "#       Immutability ensures that the hash value of a key remains constant, which is crucial for the performance and reliability \n",
    "#       of hash tables, the underlying data structure of dictionaries. Hereâ€™s a detailed discussion on the importance of immutability \n",
    "#       for dictionary keys, along with examples:\n",
    "# Importance of Immutability for Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "# 1. Consistency in Hashing\n",
    "# Dictionaries use a hash function to map keys to specific locations in the underlying hash table. If a key's value changes,\n",
    "# its hash value would also change, making it impossible to find the stored value. Immutability ensures that the key's \n",
    "# hash value remains constant throughout its lifetime in the dictionary.\n",
    "#Eg.\n",
    "d = {}\n",
    "key = [1, 2, 3]  # A list, which is mutable\n",
    "# d[key] = \"value\"  # This would raise a TypeError because lists are not hashable\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Uniqueness of Keys\n",
    "# Immutability helps maintain the uniqueness of keys. If keys were mutable, they could be altered after being added to the dictionary, \n",
    "# potentially leading to key collisions and data inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Performance\n",
    "# The efficiency of lookups, insertions, and deletions in a dictionary relies on the hash function. If keys were mutable and could change\n",
    "# after insertion, it would slow down operations and require rehashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Data Integrity\n",
    "# Using immutable keys prevents accidental changes, ensuring that the data associated with those keys remains accessible and accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#       Examples of Immutable and Mutable Types:\n",
    "#    Immutable Types (Allowed as Keys):\n",
    "# Strings: Immutable and commonly used as keys.\n",
    "# Numbers (int, float): Immutable and can be used as keys.\n",
    "# Tuples: Immutable as long as they contain only immutable elements.\n",
    "# Frozenset: An immutable version of sets, suitable for keys\n",
    "#Eg.\n",
    "d = {\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "    42: \"The Answer\",\n",
    "    (1, 2): \"coordinates\",\n",
    "    frozenset([1, 2, 3]): \"immutable set\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "print(d[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(d[42])      # Output: The Answer\n",
    "print(d[(1, 2)])  # Output: coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "#    Mutable Types (Not Allowed as Keys):\n",
    "# Lists: Mutable, as their contents can be changed.\n",
    "# Dictionaries: Mutable, and therefore cannot be used as keys.\n",
    "# Sets: Mutable and cannot be used as keys\n",
    "#Eg.\n",
    "d = {[1, 2]: \"value\"}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "d = {{1: \"one\"}: \"value\"}  # Raises TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "# Immutability of dictionary keys is crucial for maintaining data integrity, ensuring efficient operations, and preventing accidental\n",
    "# modifications. Immutable types such as strings, numbers, tuples, and frozensets are allowed as dictionary keys, while mutable types like \n",
    "# lists, dictionaries, and sets are not. This immutability requirement ensures that the keys remain consistent, unique, and reliably \n",
