    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the built-in implementation of a hashtable is called a \"dictionary\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1) in the average case for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. However, in the worst-case scenario where there are hash collisions and many elements map to the same index in the underlying array, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hashtable. To mitigate this, most hashtable implementations use techniques like chaining or open addressing to handle collisions.\n"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",
