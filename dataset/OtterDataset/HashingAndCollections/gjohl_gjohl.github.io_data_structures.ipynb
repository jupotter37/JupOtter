    "\n",
    "There are common ways that we can interact with different data structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to frame the appropriateness of a data structure for a given based on the speed of the operations that are required most for that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read: Look up the value at a particular location in the data structure\n",
    "- Search: Look for a particular value in the data structure.\n",
    "- Insert: Add a new value to the data structure.\n",
    "- Delete: Remove a value from the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading is \"find by key\", searching is \"find by value\".\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "An array is a list of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stored in memory as a block of contiguous memory addresses. When the array is declared, the head of the array is stored, i.e. the memory address of the first elelment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **size** of an array is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "The **index** denotes where a particular piece of data resides in that array.\n",

    "\n",
    "A computer can look up a given memory address in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know the head of the array and the index to look up. So we can read in **O(1)** time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Head of the array is memory address 1063.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Searching an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer has immediate access to all of its memory addresses but does not know ahead of time their *contents*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to find a particular value, we will potentially have to search through every element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching an array is therefore **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Insertion into an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of inserting into an array depends on **where** in the array you are inserting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If inserting an element at the end, we simply place the new value at that memory address (assuming the memory address is empty). This is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we insert at any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shift each of the existing elements to the right of the insert index 1 position rightwards\n",
    "2. Insert the new value in the gap created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to insert at index $i$, there are $N - i$ elements to shift (Step 1), then 1 more operation to insert the new value (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - inserting at the start of an array - insertion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Deletion from an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the efficiency of deletion depends on the index being deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If deleting the last element, there is simply 1 operation to clear the memory address, so this is a constant time operation O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we delete an element in any other position, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete the element. This leaves a gap in the middle of the array.\n",
    "2. Shift each of the elements to the right of the gap leftwards, to fill the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to delete at index $i$, we do 1 operation to delete that element (Step 1), then shift the next $N-i$ elements leftwards (Step 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst case - deleting the first element of the array - deletion is **O(N)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a collection of *unique* elements, i.e. duplicate values are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of implementing sets: array-based sets and hash-sets are discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Python already has sets, but we'll give outline implementations for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables are key:value pairs. We can look up a the value for a given key in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as hash maps, dictionaries, maps, associative arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of taking characters and converting them to numbers is called **hashing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that performs this conversion is the **hash function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function requires one condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Consistency: A hash function must convert the same string to the same number every time it's applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, for the hash function to be useful, it should also be collision resistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Collision resistant: Different inputs should hash to different outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an extreme example, the following hash function is consistent but not collision resistant:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def crappy_hash(input_str: str) -> int:\n",
    "    \"\"\"This is the world's worst hash function.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. Hash Table Lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to insert the following key:value pair into our hash table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "key = \"Name\"\n",
    "value = \"Gurp\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a hash function that is actually good, and in this particular case `hash_function(key)` returns `12`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hash table will then insert `value` at memory address `12` (or more specifically, the memory address of the head of the dictionary + 12).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means if we ever want to look up the key `\"Name\"`, we hash it and immediately know to access memory address 12 and return the value `\"Gurp\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So hash table lookups are $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, looking up by **key** is $O(1)$. Searching by **value** is essentially searching through an array, so is $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. Dealing with Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **collision** occurs when we try to add data to a cell that is already occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to handling this is called **separate chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of placing a single value in a cell, we place a *pointer to an array*. This array contains length-2 subarrays where the first element is the key and the second element is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no collisions, a hash table look up is $O(1)$.\n",
    "In the worst case, ALL keys collide and so we essentially have to search through an array which is $O(N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4. Hash Table Efficiency\n",
    "A hash tables efficiency depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much **data** we're storing in it\n",
    "2. How many **cells** are available\n",
    "3. Which **hash function** we use\n",
    "\n",
    "A good hash function (3) should distribute the data (1) evenly across all cells (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the memory is used efficiently while avoiding collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **load factor** is the ratio of data to cells, and ideally should be around 0.7, i.e. 7 elements for every 10 cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A **priority queue** is a list where deletions and access are the same as a regular queue, but *insertions are like an ordered array*.\n",
    "So the priority queue is always ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example use case is a triage system in a hospital: patients are seen based on severity, not just when they arrived.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an abstract data types that we could implement in multiple ways using different fundamental data types. E.g. we *could* implement using an ordered array, but insertions would be O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are another data structure that fit this use case well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2. Binary Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "There a multiple kinds of heaps. As a starting point, we consider the **binary max-heap**, which is a special kind of binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary max-heap conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heap condition**: Each node is greater than its children.\n",
    "2. The tree must be **complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the heap condition is true for each node, we can recursively reason that a node is greater than its children, and they are too, then a node is greater than all of its *descendants*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **complete** condition essentially means values are filled left-to-right, top-down with no holes. There are no empty positions anywhere except the bottom row, and the bottom row is filled from left to right. The **last node** is the rightmost node at its bottom level.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a min-heap variant. The difference is trivial, aside from the heap condition inequality being reversed, the logic is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3. Heap Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heaps are *weakly ordered*.\n",
    "- The root node is the maximum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a binary search tree, we know precisely whether a value is the left or right descendant of a node. E.g. `3` will be a left child of `100`. \n",
    "\n",
    "But in a max-heap, we don't know whether `3` is to the left or right, only that it is a descendant rather than an ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Searching** would require inspecting every node, $O(N)$. In practice, searching a heap is not typically done in the use cases it is used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reading** a heap typically refers to accessing the root node, which is $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.4. Inserting into a Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Last node**: Insert the new node as the heap's last node\n",
    "2. **Trickle up the new node**: Compare the new node to its parent. If it's greater than its parent, swap them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of steps to trickle is proportional to the depth of the tree. Therefore, insertion is a $O(log N)$ operation.\n",

    "### 10.5. Deleting from a Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "We only ever delete the root node from a heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **New root**: The *last node* becomes the new root node.\n",
    "2. **Trickle down the root node**: Trickle the root down to its proper place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trickling down is more complicated than trickling up because there are two possible directions to swap in. We compare to *both* children and **swap with the larger** of the two. This ensures the largest value ends up as the root node, which is the key property we want to preserve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deletion is also $O(log N)$ since the number of steps to trickle is again proprtional to the depth of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.7 The Problem of the Last Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operations with heaps, such as insertion, rely on knowing where the last node is. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because inserting/deleting the last node ensures the heap is always *complete*, and completeness is important to ensure the graph remains *well-balanced*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being well-balanced ensures the heap remains *efficient*. As in the case of binary search tree, if a tree is severely unbalanced it effectively becomes a linked list, so actions that should search through the depth of the tree in $O(log N)$ time take $O(N)$ in the worst case.\n",

    "2. **Insertion using Binary Representation**: To insert a new node into the heap, you convert the index of the node into binary form. Starting from the most significant bit (MSB), traverse the heap according to the binary digits:\n",
    "    1. If the bit is 0, move to the left child.\n",
    "    2. If the bit is 1, move to the right child.\n",
    "3. **Insertion at the Last Available Position**: As you traverse the heap, you'll eventually reach a node that doesn't exist yet. This node represents the last available position in the heap, where the new node can be inserted while maintaining the complete binary tree property.\n",

    "This is a kind of tree which is particularly useful for text-based features.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two flavours of search: (1) checking if a substring is a valid prefix, and (2) checking if a substring is a valid whole word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm below is for the more general case of searching for a prefix. Searching for a whole word then becomes trivial because we have a terminal character, so we can search for \"Implement*\" to find the whole word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through the trie one character at a time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialise `current_node` at the root.\n",
    "2. Iterate through each character of `search_string` and see if current_node has a child with that key.\n",
    "3. Repeat Step 3 for the whole `search_string`. If the character is not a valid key, the word does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of a trie search depends on the *length of the search term*, $K$, **not** the *number of elements stored in the trie*, $N$. Therefore, it has complexity $O(K)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.2. Trie Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting a new word into a trie follows similar steps to searching for an existing word: we traverse the trie and insert new nodes where they do not already exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialise `current_node` at the root.\n",
    "2. Iterate through each character of `search_string` and see if current_node has a child with that key.\n",
    "    1. If the key exists, update `current_node` to move to that next node.\n",
    "    2. Otherwise, create a new child node and update `current_node` to move to it.\n",
    "3. Insert the terminal character of the word at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is again $O(K)$ since it depends on the length of the input, not the data stored in the trie.\n",
