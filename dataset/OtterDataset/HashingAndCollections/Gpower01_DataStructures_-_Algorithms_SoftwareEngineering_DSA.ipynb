    "2) Space complaxity - the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm relative to input size\n",

    "There are some common assumptions that we make. Wehen dealing with integers, the larger t he integer, the more time operations like addition, multiplication or printing will take. While this **is** relevant in theory, we typically ignore this fact because the difference is practically very small, and treat all integers the same. If you are given an array of integers as an input, the only variable you would ues is _n_ to denote the length of the array. Technically, you could introduce another variable, let's say _k_ which denotes the average value of the integers in the array. However, nobody does this. \n",

For example, we could have a problem where the input is two arrays. _n_ could denote the length of one while _m_ denotes the length of the other.\n",

    "**Calculating complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above example (find the largest number in `nuums`), we have a time complexity of **O(n)**. The algorithm involves iterating over each elements in `nums`, so if we define _n_ as the length of `nums`, ou algorithm uses approximately _n_ steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10`, it will perform approximately `10` steps. If we pass an array with a length of `10,000,000,000`, it will perform approximately `10,000,000,000` steps. \n",

    "- Being able to analyze an algorithm and calculate it's time and space complexity is a crucial skill. Interviewers will **almost always** ask you for your algorithm's complexity to check that you actually understand your algorithm and didn't just memorize/copy the code. Being able to analyze an algorithm also enables you to determine what parts of it can be improved. \n",
    "\n",

    "**Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few rules when it comes to calculating complexity. First, **we ignore constants**. That means $O(9999999n) = O(8n) = O(n) = O(\\frac{n}{500})$. Why do we do this? Imagine you had two algorithms. Algorithm A uses approximately _n_ operations and algorithm B uses approximately _5n_ operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When _n_ = 100, algorithm A uses 100 operations and algorithm B uses 500 operations. What happens if we double _n_ ? Then algorithm A uses 200 operations and algorithm B uses 1000 operations. As you can see, When we double the value of _n_, both algorithms require double the amount of operations. If we were to _10x_ the value of _n_, then both algorithms would require _10x_ more operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: the point of complexity is to analyze the algorithm **as the input changes**. We don't care that algorithm B is _5x_ slower than algorithm A. For both algorithms, as the input size increases, the number of operations required increases **linearly**. That's what we care about. Thus, both algorithms are **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second rule is that we consider the complexity as the variables **tend to infinity**. When we have additions/subtraction between terms of the **same variable, we ignore all terms except the most powerful one**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $O(2^{n} + n^{2} - 500) = O(2^{n})$. Why? Because as _n_ tends to infinity, $2^{n}$ becomes so large that the other two terms are effectively zero in comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we had an algorithm that required _n_ + 500 operations. It has a time complexity of $O(n)$. When _n_ is small, let's say n = 5, the +500 term is very significant - but we don't care about that. We need to perform the analysis as if _n_ is tending toward infinity, and in that scenario, the 500 is nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "* The best complexity possible is **O(1)**, called \"constant time\" or \"constant space\". it means that the algorithm ALWAYS uses the same amount of resources, regardless of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a constant time complexity doesn't neccessarily mean that an algorithm is fast $(O(5000000) = O(1))$, it just means that it's runtime is independent of the input size. \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:\n",

    "* Average case \n",
    "* Worst case scenario \n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",

    "In most algorithms, all three of these will be equal, but some algorithms will have them differ. If you have to choose only one to represent the algorithm's time or space complexity, never choose the best case scenario. It is most correct to use the worst case scenario, but you should be able to talk about the difference between the cases. \n",

With binary search, we initially consider the entire input ($n$ elements). After the first step, we only consider $n/2$ elements. After the second step, we only consider $n/4$ elements, and so on.

This means we have two integers, usually named something like `i` and `j` or `left` and `right` which each represent an `index` of the array or string.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Use a `while loop` until the pointers are equal to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers towards each other. This means either increment the pointer that start at the first index, decrement the pointer that started at the last index,, or both. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve. \n",

    "- The strength of this technique is that we will never have more than $O(n)$ iterations for the while loop because the pointers start $n$ away from each other and move at least one step closer in every iteration. Therefore, if we can keep the work inside each iteration at $O(1)$, this technique will result in a linear runtime, which is usually the best possible runtime. Let's look at some example:\n",

    "After reversing a string, the first character becomes the last character. If a string is the same after being reversed, that means the first character is the same as the last character, the second character is the same as the second last character, and so on. We can use the two pointers technique here to check that all corresponding characters are equal. To start, we check the first and last characters using two separate pointers. To check the next pair of characters, we just need to move our pointers toward each other one position. We continue until the pointers meet each other or we find a mismatch.\n",

To move on to the next pair, we move the left index forward by one, and the right index backward by one. Again, we check if the pair of characters are equal, and if they aren't, we return false.\n",

Algorithms are beautiful because of how abstract they are - \"two pointers\" is just an idea, and it can be implemented in many different ways. Let's look at another method and some new examples. The following method is capable when the problem has two iterables in the input, for example, two arrays. \n",

    "4) Because our while loop will stop when one of the pointers reaches the end, the other pointer will not be at the end of its respective iterable when the loop finishes. Sometimes, we need to iterate through all elements - if this is the case, you will need to write extra code here to make sure both iterables are exhausted. \n",

If we have $n = arr1.length + arr2.length$, then this gives a time complexity of $O(n⋅logn)$ (the cost of sorting).

In that case, the time complexity of the sorting approach would be $O((n+m)⋅log(m+n))$ and the time complexity of the approach we are about to cover would be $O(n+m)$. It doesn't really make a difference, but one justification we could give here is that since we are combining the arrays, the total length is a significant number, so it makes sense to represent it as $n$.\n",

    "## Sliding Window\n",
    "Like **two pointers**, sliding windows work the same with arrays and strings - the important thing is that they're iterables with ordered elements. For the sake of brevity, the first part of this article up until the examples will be focusing on **arrays**. However, all the logic is identical for strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sliding window is another common approach to solving problems related to arrays. A sliding window is actually implemented using **two pointers**! Before we start, we need to talk about the concept of a **subarray**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subarrays\n",
    "Givern an array, a **subarray** is a contiguous section of the array. All the elements must be adjacent to each other in the original array and in their original order. For example, with the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the subarrays (grouped by length) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [1], [2], [3], [4]\n",
    "- [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]\n",
    "- [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "- [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "**A subarray can be defined by two indices, the start and end**. For example, with `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the subarray `[2, 3]` has a starting index of `1` and an ending index of `2`. Let's call the starting index the **left bound** and the ending index the **right bound**. Another name for subarray in this context is `\"window\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When should we use sliding window?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very common group of problems involving subarrays that can be solved efficiently with sliding window. Let's talk about how to identify this problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **first**, the problem will either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that make a subarray \"valid\". There are 2 components regarding what makes a subarray valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A constraint metric. This is some attribute of a subarray. It could be the sum, the number of unique elements, the frequency of a specific element, or any other attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A numeric restriction on the constraint metric. This is what the constraint metric should be for a subarray to be considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, let's say a problem declares a subarray is valid if it has a sum less than or equal to `10`. The constraint metric here is the sum of the subarray, and the numeric restriction is `<= 10`. A subarray is considered valid if its constraint metric conforms to the numeric restriction, i.e. the sum is less than or equal to `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Second**, the problem will ask you to find valid subarrays in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The most common task you will see is finding the best valid subarray. The problem will define what makes a subarray better than another. For example, a problem might ask you to find the **longest** valid subarray. \n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Another common task is finding the number of valid subarrays. We will take a look at this later in the article. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whenever a problem description talks about subarrays, you should figure out if sliding window is a good option by analyzing the problem description. If you can find the things mentioned above, then it's a good bet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is a preview of some of the example problems that we will look at in this article, to help you better understand what sliding window problems look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`\n",
    "* Find the longest substing that has at most one `0`\n",
    "* Find the number of the subarrays that have a product less than `k`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind a sliding window is to consider **only** valid subarrays. Recall that a subarray can be defined by a left bound (the index of the first element) and a right bound (the index of the last element). In sliding window, we maintain two variables `left` and `right`, which at any given time represent the **current subarray** under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have `left = right = 0`, which means that the first subarray we look at is just the first element of the array on its own. We want to expand the size of our `\"window\"`, and we do that by incrementing `right`. When we increment `right`, this is like \"adding\" a new element to our window.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if after adding a new element, the subarray becomes invalid? We need to \"remove\" some elements from our window until it becomes valid again. To \"remove\" elements, we can increment `left`, which shrinks our window.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we add and remove elements, we are `\"sliding\"` our window along the input from left to right. The window's size is constantly changing - it grows as large as it can until it's invalid, and then it shrinks. However, it always slides along to the right, until we reach the end of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain why this algorithm works, let's look at a specific example. Let's say that we are given a positive integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the length of the longest subarray that has a sum less than or equal to `k`. For this example, let `nums = [3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1]` and `k = 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we have `left = right = 0`, so our window is only the first element: `[3]`. Now, let's expand to the right until the constraint is broken. This will occur when `left = 0`, `right = 2`, and our window is: `[3, 2, 1]`. The sum here is `6`, which is greater than `k`. We must now shrink the window from the left until the constraint is no longer broken. After removing one element, the window becomes valid again: `[2, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it correct to remove this `3` and forget about it for the rest of the algorithm? Because the input only has positive integers, a longer subarray directly equals a larger sum. We know that `[3, 2, 1]` already results in a sum that is too large. There is no way for us to ever have a valid window again if we keep this `3` because if we were to add any more elements from the right, the sum would only get larger. That's why we can forget about the `3` for the rest of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation \n",
    "Now that you have an idea of how sliding window works, let's talk about how to implement it. For this section, we will use the previous example (find the longest subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, we need to identify a **constraint metric**. In our example, the constraint metric is the sum of the window. How do we keep track of the sum of the window as elements are added and removed? One way that we could do it is by keeping the window in a separate array. When we add elements from the right, we add them to our array. When we remove elements from the left, we remove the corresponding elements from the array. This way, we can always find the sum of our current window just by summing the elements in the separate array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very inefficient as removing elements and finding the sum of the window will be $O(n)$ operations. How can we do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't actually need to store the window in a separate array. All we need is some variable, let's call it curr, that keeps track of the current sum. When we add a new element from the right, we just do `curr += nums[right]`. When we remove an element from the left, we just do `curr -= nums[left]`. This way, all operations are done in $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, how do we move the pointers `left` and `right?` Remember, we want to keep expanding our window, and the window always slides to the right - it just might shrink a few times in between. Because `right` is always moving forward, we can use a `for loop` to iterate right over the input. In each iteration of the `for loop`, we will be `adding the element nums[right] to our window`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about `left?` When we move `left`, we are shrinking our window. We only shrink our window when it becomes invalid. By maintaining `curr`, we can easily tell if the current window is valid by checking the condition `curr <= k`. When we add a new element and the window becomes invalid, we may need to remove multiple elements from the left. For example, let's say `nums = [1, 1, 1, 3]` and `k = 3`. When we arrive at the `3` and add it to the window, the window becomes invalid. We need to remove three elements from the left before the window becomes valid again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that we should use a while loop to perform the removals. The condition will be `while (curr > k)` (while the window is invalid). To perform the removals, we do `curr -= nums[left]` and then increment `left` in each iteration of the while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, how do we update the answer? In each `for loop iteration`, after the `while loop`, the current window is valid. We can write code here to update the answer. **The formula for the length of a window is right - left + 1**.\n",

    "### Why is Sliding window efficient ?\n",
    "\n",
    "For any array, how many subarrays are there? If the array has a length of `n`, there are `n` subarrays of length `1`. Then there are `n - 1` subarrays of length `2` (every index except the last one can be a starting index), `n - 2` subarrays of length `3` and so on until there is only `1` subarray of length `n`. This means there are $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k=\\frac{n.(n+1)}{2}$ subarrays (it's the partial sum of this [series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF#Partial_sums)). In terms of time complexity, any algorithm that looks at every subarray will be at least $O(n^2)$, which is usually too slow. A sliding window guarantees a maximum of $2n$ window iterations - the right pointer can move $n$ times and the left pointer can move $n$ times. This means if the logic done for each window is $O(1)$, sliding window algorithms run in $O(n)$, which is **much** faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may be thinking: there is a while loop inside of the for loop, isn't the time complexity $O(n^2)$? The reason it is still $O(n)$ is that the while loop can only iterate $n$ times in total for the entire algorithm (`left` starts at $0$, only increases, and never exceeds `n`). If the while loop were to run `n` times on one iteration of the for loop, that would mean it wouldn't run at all for all the other iterations of the for loop. This is what we refer to as [amortized analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis) - even though the worst case for an iteration inside the for loop is $O(n)$, it averages out to $O(1)$ when you consider the entire runtime of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now let's look at some sliding window examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `k`. This is the problem we have been talking about above. We will now formally solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use an integer `curr` that tracks the `sum` of the current window. Since the problem wants subarrays whose sum is less than or equal to `k`, we want to maintain `curr <= k`. Let's look at an example where `nums = [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5`] and `k = 8`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The window starts empty, but we can grow it to `[3, 1, 2]` while maintaining the constraint. However, after adding the `7`, the window's sum becomes too large. We need to tighten the window until the sum is below `8` again, which doesn't happen until our window looks like `[7]`. When we try to add the next element, our window again becomes too large, and we need to remove the `7` which means we have `[4]`. We can now grow the window until it looks like `[4, 2, 1, 1]`, but adding the next element makes the sum too large. We remove elements from the left until it fits the constraint again, which happens at `[1, 1, 5]`. The longest subarray we found was `[4, 2, 1, 1]` which means the answer is `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add an element to the window by moving the right bound, we just do `curr += value`. When we remove an element from the window by moving the left bound, we just do `curr -= value.` We should remove elements so long as `curr > k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More detailed explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize what each variable does in the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `left`: the leftmost index of our current window\n",
    "* `right`: the rightmost index of our current window\n",
    "* `curr`: the sum of our current window\n",
    "* `ans`: the length of the longest valid window we have seen so far\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate `right` over the input to add elements to the window. Update `curr` by adding `nums[right]` to it. When the window becomes invalid `(curr > k)`, remove elements from the window by subtracting `nums[left]` from `curr`. Then increment `left`. We need to do this until the window becomes valid again, so we use a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of a window is `right - left + 1`. Update our answer only when the window becomes valid.\n",

    "-  **$O(n)$ String Building**\n",
    "We mentioned earlier that in most languages, strings are immutable. This means concatenating a single character to a string is an $O(n)$ operation. If you have a string that is 1 million characters long, and you want to add one more character, all 1 million characters need to be copied over to another string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems will ask you to return a string, and usually, this string will be built during the algorithm. Let's say the final string is of length `n` and we build it one character at a time with concatenation. What would the time complexity be? The operations needed at each step would be `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`. This is the partial sum of this series, which leads to $O(n^2)$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple concatenation will result in an $O(n^2)$ time complexity if you are using a language where strings are immutable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are better ways to build strings in just $O(n)$ time. This will vary between languages - here, we'll talk about Python and Java - if you're using another language, we recommend researching the best way to build strings in your language.\n",

    "**Python**\n",
    "1) Declare a list \n",
    "2) When building the string, add the characters to the list. This is $O(1)$ per operation. Across `n` operations, it will cost $O(n)$ in total \n",
    "3) Once finished, convert the list to a string using `\"\".join(list)`. This is $O(n)$.\n",
    "4) In total, it cost us $O(n + n) = O(2n) = O(n)$."

    "\n",
    "**If a problem has explicit constraints such as:**\n",
    "- Sum greater than or less than `k`\n",

    "\n",
    "Think about a sliding window. Note that not all problems with these characteristics should be solved with a sliding window, and not all sliding window problems have these characteristics. These characteristics should only be used as a general guideline.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a problem's input is an integer array and you find yourself needing to calculate multiple subarray sums, consider building a prefix sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of a subarray between `i` and `j` (inclusive) is `j - i + 1`. This is also the number of subarrays that end at `j`, starting from `i` or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subsequences**\n",
    "A subsequence is a set of elements of an array/string that keeps the same relative order but doesn't need to be contiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, subsequences of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` include: `[1, 3], [4], [], [2, 3]`, **but not** `[3, 2], [5], [4, 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, subsequence problems are more difficult. Because this is only the first chapter, it is difficult to talk about subsequence patterns now. Subsequences will come up again later in the course - for example, dynamic programming is used to solve a lot of subsequence problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the patterns we have learned so far, the most common one associated with subsequences is two pointers** when two input arrays/strings are given (we did look at one problem in the two pointers articles involving subsequences). **Because prefix sums and sliding windows represent subarrays/substrings, they are not applicable here**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subset**\n",
    "A subset is any set of elements from the original array or string. The order doesn't matter and neither do the elements being beside each other. For example, given [1, 2, 3, 4], all of these are subsets: `[3, 2], [4, 1, 2], [1]`. Note: subsets that contain the same elements are considered the same, so `[1, 2, 4]` is the same subset as `[4, 1, 2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be thinking, what is the difference between subsequences and subsets if subsets with the same elements are considered the same? In subsequences, the order matters - let's say you had an array of integers and you needed to find a subsequence with 3 consecutive elements `(like 1, 2, 3)`. This would be harder than finding a subset with 3 consecutive elements because, with a subset, the 3 elements simply need to exist. In a subsequence, the elements need to exist in the correct relative order.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that if a problem involves subsequences, but the order of the subsequence doesn't actually matter (let's say it wants the sum of subsequences), then you can treat it the same as a subset. A useful thing that you can do when dealing with subsets that you can't do with subsequences is that you can sort the input, since the order doesn't matter.\n",

    "**Closing Notes**\n",
    "That's all for the arrays and strings chapter. Because of the simplicity of the topic, it is difficult to delve into deeper problems at the moment. However, the structure of this course involves building on knowledge incrementally. For example, there are dozens of sliding window problems on LeetCode that we couldn't talk about here because we haven't talked about hash maps yet. Because almost all non tree/graph/linked list problems have an array or string in the input, this will definitely not be the last we see of the patterns learned in the chapter.\n",

    "## Hashing \n",
    "Before we start this chapter, let's quickly talk about data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic terms, a data structure is a format for organizing data in an efficient way. In practical terms, we can split data structures into two things: the interface and the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface is like a contract that specifies how we can interact with the data structure - what operations we can perform on it, what inputs it expects, and what outputs we can expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dynamic array. The interface would include operations like appending, insertion, removal, updating, and more. These operations are well-defined and have specific rules that we must follow when we use them. If we want to append an element, we use the built-in method like `.append()` or `.push()` while passing in the element we want to add as an argument. Typically this operation doesn't return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the implementation is the code that actually makes the data structure work. This is where the details of how the data is stored and how the operations are performed come into play. For example, the implementation of a dynamic array might involve allocating memory for the list, tracking the size, and rearranging the elements when an operation like remove is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many data structures, the implementation can be quite complex, involving intricate algorithms and data manipulation. However we don't need to worry about those details - we only need to understand the interface and how to use it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article and a few others in the course, we will talk about the underlying implementation details behind a data structure. While it does help to have a basic understanding, don't worry too much about memorizing these details. We have included them for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the point of a hash function** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that arrays have $O(1)$ random access. Given an arbitrary index, we can access and update its value in the array in constant time. The main constraint with arrays is that they are a fixed size, and the indices have to be integers. Because hash functions can convert any input into an integer, we can effectively remove the constraint of indices needing to be integers. When a hash function is combined with an array, it creates a **hash map**, also known as a **hash table** or **dictionary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With arrays, we **map** indices to values. With hash maps, we map **keys** to values, and a key can be almost anything. Typically, the only constraint on a hash map's key is that it has to be **immutable** (this is language dependent but generally a good rule of thumb). Values can be anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash map is probably the most important concept in all of algorithm interviewing. It is extremely powerful and allows you to reduce the time complexity of an algorithm by a factor of $O(n)$ for a huge amount of problems. Every major language has a [built-in implementation of a hash map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). For example, in Python they're called dictionaries and declaring one is as simple as `dic = {}`. If you could only take one thing from this course, it should be to master the hash map interface for the programming language you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a hash map is an unordered data structure that stores key-value pairs. A hash map can add and remove elements in $O(1)$, as well as update values associated with a key and check if a key exists, also in $O(1)$. You can iterate over both the keys and values of a **hash map**, but the iteration won't necessarily follow any order (there are many implementations and this is language dependent for the built-in types).\n",
    "\n",
    "**An ordered data structure is one where the insertion order is \"remembered\". An unordered data structure is one where the insertion order is not relevant.**"

    "However, from a practical perspective, there are some disadvantages to using hash maps, and it's important to know them as it is common in interviews to talk about tradeoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest disadvantage of hash maps is that for smaller input sizes, they can be slower due to overhead. Because big O ignores constants, the $O(1)$ time complexity can sometimes be deceiving - it's usually something more like $O(10)$ because every key needs to go through the hash function, and there can also be collisions, which we will talk about in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables can also take up more space. Dynamic arrays are actually fixed-size arrays that resize themselves when they go beyond their capacity. Hash tables are also implemented using a fixed size array - remember that the size is a limit set by the programmer. The problem is, resizing a hash table is much more expensive because every existing key needs to be re-hashed, and also a hash table may use an array that is significantly larger than the number of elements stored, resulting in a huge waste of space. Let's say you chose your limit as 10,000 items, but you only end up storing 10. Okay, you could argue that 10,000 is too large, but then what if your next test case ends up needing to store 100,000 elements? The point is, when you don't know how many elements you need to store, arrays are more flexible with resizing and not wasting space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: remember that time complexity functions only involve the variables you define. When we say that hash map operations are $O(1)$, the variable we are concerned with is usually $n$ which is the size of the hash map. However, this may be misleading. For example, hashing a string requires $O(m)$ time, where $m$ is the length of the string. The constant time operations are only constant relative to the size of the map.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collisions\n",
    "When different keys convert to the same integer, it is called a collision. Without handling collisions, older keys will get overridden and data will be lost. There are [multiple ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Collision_resolution) to handle collisions, but here we'll talk about a common one called **chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using chaining, we store linked lists inside the hash map's array instead of the elements themselves. The linked list nodes store both the key and the value. If there are collisions, the collided key-value pairs are linked together in a linked list. Then, when trying to access one of these key-value pairs, we traverse through the linked list until the key matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions are problematic because handling them is necessary, and handling them takes time, slowing down the overall speed and efficiency of the hash map. How can we design our hash map to minimize collisions? The most important thing is that the size of your hash table's array and [modulus is a prime number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1145217/why-should-hash-functions-use-a-prime-number-modulus). Prime numbers near significant magnitudes that are common to use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10,007\n",
    "* 1,000,003\n",
    "* 1,000,000,007\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sets\n",
    "A set is another data structure that is very similar to a hash table. It uses the same mechanism for hashing keys into integers. The difference between a set and hash table is that sets do not map their keys to anything. Sets are more convenient to use when you only care about checking if elements exist. You can add, remove, and check if an element exists in a set all in $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note about sets is that they don't track frequency. If you have a set and add the same element 100 times, the first operation adds it and the next 99 do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arrays as keys?\n",
    "We said that being immutable is usually a requirement for being a hash map key. Arrays are mutable, so how do we store an ordered collection of elements as a key? Depending on the language you're using, there are several ways to convert an array into a unique immutable key. In Python, tuples are immutable, so it's as easy as doing `tuple(arr)`. Another trick is to convert the array into a string, delimited by some character that is guaranteed to not show up in any element. For example, use a comma to separate integers. `[1, 51, 163] --> \"1,51,163\"`."

    "This problem is a good discussion point for why a hash map is convenient. You may be thinking, since our keys are integers, why can't we just use an array instead of a hash map? We could, but the problem is that the array needs to be at least as large as the maximum element. What if we have a test case like `[1, 2, 3, 1000]`? We need to initialize an array of size `1000`, even though only a few of the indices will actually be used. Therefore, using an array could end up being a huge waste of space. Sure, sometimes it would be more efficient because of the overhead of a hash map, but overall, a hash map is much safer. Even if `99999999999` is in the input, it doesn't matter - the hash map handles it like any other element.\n",

    "Let's say that there are $n$ lists and each list has an average of $m$ elements. To populate our hash map, it costs $O(n⋅m)$ to iterate over all the elements. The next loop iterates over all unique elements that we encountered. If all elements are unique, this can cost up to $O(n⋅m)$, although this won't affect our time complexity since the previous loop also cost $O(n⋅m)$. Finally, there can be at most $m$ elements inside ans when we **perform the sort**, which means in the **worst case, the sort will cost** $O(m⋅logm)$. This gives us a time complexity of $O(n⋅m+m⋅logm)=O(m⋅(n+logm))$. If every element in the input is unique, then the hash map will grow to a size of $n⋅m$, which means the algorithm has a space complexity of $O(n⋅m)$."
