    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a _______________.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "# By making the code case sensitive, it will be able to identify if the song is on the album even the the user fails to make it so that the album's songs are correctly captialized\n",
    "# Additionally, the code can further be worked on upon by adding multiple dictionaries of other Albums made by Taylor Swift to make it so that if a user makes an input of song that is not on Lover."

    "    -  My favorite song by Taylor Swift is Champagne Problems on Evermore. I really like how slow and relaxing the piano is in the background and how she narrates an amazing song about a lovers slowly separating due to diveraging interests and priorities. My sister explained it to me one day and I just thought the concept was very interesting, and it's been my favorite song by her since. It's very soothing to listen to late at night and the chorus and melody is very rememberable. I just enjoy listening to this song in the car or late at night. "
