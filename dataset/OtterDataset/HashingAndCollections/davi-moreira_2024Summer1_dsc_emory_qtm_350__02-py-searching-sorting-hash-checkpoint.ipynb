    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Process of Halving:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you halve a list (or any set of elements), each halving operation reduces the number of elements to half of its current size. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you start with $ n $ elements, after one halving, you have $ \\frac{n}{2} $ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a second halving, you have $ \\frac{n}{4} $ elements, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The halving continues until you cannot halve further, which ideally ends at 1 element. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find how many times you can perform this operation, you are essentially asking, \"How many times must you multiply 2 (the base of the halving) to reach $ n $?\" Mathematically, this question translates into solving for $ k $ in the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2^k = n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ 2 $ is the base, representing the halving.\n",
    "- $ k $ is the number of times you multiply 2 together to reach $ n $.\n",
    "- $ n $ is the initial size of your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Logarithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. To solve for $ k $, you take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the equation $ 2^k = n $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = \\log_2(n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells you that $ k $ (the number of halvings) is equal to $ \\log_2(n) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ n = 8 $:\n",
    "- After 1 halving: 4 elements ($ \\frac{8}{2} $)\n",
    "- After 2 halvings: 2 elements ($ \\frac{4}{2} $)\n",
    "- After 3 halvings: 1 element ($ \\frac{2}{2} $)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $ 2^3 = 8 $ leads to $ \\log_2(8) = 3 $. This tells us it takes 3 halvings to reduce 8 elements to 1, aligning with $ \\log_2(n) = 3 $ for $ n = 8 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the operation of binary search, which depends on this process of halving, has a logarithmic time complexity ($ O(\\log n) $), as the list size $ n $ can be divided $ \\log_2(n) $ times until only one or no elements are left. "

This gives us a worst case timing, because searching is the slowest  if it has to keep looking; it can be faster if it finds something right away. For example, if it's the 1st element, then linear search would seem extremely fast."

    "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `selection_sort` takes a single argument `x`, which is a list of elements that need to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Length of List**:\n",
    "   - The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `x`. This will be used to control the iterations of the sorting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting Loop**:\n",
    "   - A `for` loop is initiated with the range from 0 to `n-1` (since `range` in Python is non-inclusive of the end value). The loop variable `i` represents the current position in the list that the algorithm is attempting to fill with the correct element.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding the Minimum Element**:\n",
    "   - Within the loop, the function uses `np.argmin(x[i:])` to find the index of the smallest element in the sublist `x[i:]`, which is the portion of the list from index `i` to the end. It then adds `i` to this index because `np.argmin` returns the index within the sliced list `x[i:]`, not the full list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Swapping Elements**:\n",
    "   - Once the index of the minimum element (`min_ind`) is found, a swap operation is performed to place this minimum element into its correct position `i` in the list. The swapping is done using the tuple unpacking feature in Python, which allows for the values of `x[i]` and `x[min_ind]` to be exchanged in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Returning the Sorted List**:\n",
    "   - After the loop has finished executing, all elements have been moved to their correct positions, and the list `x` is sorted. The sorted list `x` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Function Annotations**:\n",
    "   - The function includes a docstring with a brief description, parameter annotations, return value description, and examples of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **In-place Sorting**:\n",
    "   - It's important to note that selection sort is performed in-place, meaning the list `x` is sorted without requiring additional memory for another list.\n",

    "- `num_buckets` is an optional parameter that defaults to 4, setting the number of buckets in the hash table.\n",
    "- `self.stuff` is initialized as an empty list, which will eventually contain other lists representing the buckets of the hash table.\n",
    "- The `for` loop creates `num_buckets` empty lists within `self.stuff`, each representing a bucket where items will be stored.\n",

    "**`add` Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method adds an `item` to the hash table.\n",
    "- First, it checks whether the item is already contained in the table using the `contains` method. If not, it proceeds to add the item.\n",
    "- To determine which bucket to place the item in, the method uses the built-in `hash` function to generate a hash code for the `item` and then takes the modulo of that hash code with the number of buckets (`self.n`). This ensures the hash code maps to one of the existing buckets.\n",
    "- The item is then appended to the appropriate bucket list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`contains` Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method checks if an `item` is present in the hash table.\n",
    "- Similar to the `add` method, it uses the built-in `hash` function and modulo operation to find the bucket that the `item` would be placed in.\n",
    "- It then checks if the `item` is present in that bucket (which is a list) using Python's `in` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`__str__` Method:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method defines the string representation of the `HashTable` object.\n",
    "- When you print an instance of the `HashTable` or use the `str()` function on it, this method returns a string representation of `self.stuff`, which is the list of buckets with their contained items.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hash table implementation is a rudimentary form of what is used in more complex data structures. It doesn't handle collisions in a sophisticated way (it simply appends items to the list in the bucket, which could lead to all items in the same bucket in the case of hash collisions). It also does not provide a method for removing items or resizing the table when it gets too full, which are common features in robust hash table implementations."

    "The `defaultdict` is a subclass of the dictionary class that returns a default value for the missing keys. Its importance in time complexity discussions can be highlighted by how it simplifies code that adds to collections of items within dictionaries. Without `defaultdict`, one would have to manually check whether a key exists in the dictionary and possibly initialize a new list for that key before appending to it. `defaultdict` automatically initializes a new list when a key is not present, thus avoiding key errors and making the code cleaner and more efficient.\n",

However, when a key does not exist, it calls the default factory function, which takes constant time, so the overall time complexity remains O(1). This ensures that operations on `defaultdict` do not significantly affect the time complexity of algorithms that utilize it.\n"
