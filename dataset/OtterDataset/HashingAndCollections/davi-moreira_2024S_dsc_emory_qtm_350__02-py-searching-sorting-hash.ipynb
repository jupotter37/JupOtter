    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Process of Halving:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you halve a list (or any set of elements), each halving operation reduces the number of elements to half of its current size. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you start with $ n $ elements, after one halving, you have $ \\frac{n}{2} $ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After a second halving, you have $ \\frac{n}{4} $ elements, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The halving continues until you cannot halve further, which ideally ends at 1 element. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find how many times you can perform this operation, you are essentially asking, \"How many times must you multiply 2 (the base of the halving) to reach $ n $?\" Mathematically, this question translates into solving for $ k $ in the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2^k = n $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ 2 $ is the base, representing the halving.\n",
    "- $ k $ is the number of times you multiply 2 together to reach $ n $.\n",
    "- $ n $ is the initial size of your list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Logarithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. To solve for $ k $, you take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the equation $ 2^k = n $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = \\log_2(n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells you that $ k $ (the number of halvings) is equal to $ \\log_2(n) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ n = 8 $:\n",
    "- After 1 halving: 4 elements ($ \\frac{8}{2} $)\n",
    "- After 2 halvings: 2 elements ($ \\frac{4}{2} $)\n",
    "- After 3 halvings: 1 element ($ \\frac{2}{2} $)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $ 2^3 = 8 $ leads to $ \\log_2(8) = 3 $. This tells us it takes 3 halvings to reduce 8 elements to 1, aligning with $ \\log_2(n) = 3 $ for $ n = 8 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the operation of binary search, which depends on this process of halving, has a logarithmic time complexity ($ O(\\log n) $), as the list size $ n $ can be divided $ \\log_2(n) $ times until only one or no elements are left. "

    "Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**:\n",
    "   - The function `selection_sort` takes a single argument `x`, which is a list of elements that need to be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Length of List**:\n",
    "   - The variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `x`. This will be used to control the iterations of the sorting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting Loop**:\n",
    "   - A `for` loop is initiated with the range from 0 to `n-1` (since `range` in Python is non-inclusive of the end value). The loop variable `i` represents the current position in the list that the algorithm is attempting to fill with the correct element.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Finding the Minimum Element**:\n",
    "   - Within the loop, the function uses `np.argmin(x[i:])` to find the index of the smallest element in the sublist `x[i:]`, which is the portion of the list from index `i` to the end. It then adds `i` to this index because `np.argmin` returns the index within the sliced list `x[i:]`, not the full list `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Swapping Elements**:\n",
    "   - Once the index of the minimum element (`min_ind`) is found, a swap operation is performed to place this minimum element into its correct position `i` in the list. The swapping is done using the tuple unpacking feature in Python, which allows for the values of `x[i]` and `x[min_ind]` to be exchanged in a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Returning the Sorted List**:\n",
    "   - After the loop has finished executing, all elements have been moved to their correct positions, and the list `x` is sorted. The sorted list `x` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Function Annotations**:\n",
    "   - The function includes a docstring with a brief description, parameter annotations, return value description, and examples of usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **In-place Sorting**:\n",
    "   - It's important to note that selection sort is performed in-place, meaning the list `x` is sorted without requiring additional memory for another list.\n",
