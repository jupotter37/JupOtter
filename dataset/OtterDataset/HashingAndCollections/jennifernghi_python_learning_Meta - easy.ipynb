    "# 1.Valid Word Abbreviation\n",
    " \n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/description/\n",
    "A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a string such as \"substitution\" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"s10n\" (\"s ubstitutio n\")\n",
    "- \"sub4u4\" (\"sub stit u tion\")\n",
    "- \"12\" (\"substitution\")\n",
    "- \"su3i1u2on\" (\"su bst i t u ti on\")\n",
    "- \"substitution\" (no substrings replaced)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are not valid abbreviations:\n",
    "- \"s55n\" (\"s ubsti tutio n\", the replaced substrings are adjacent)\n",
    "- \"s010n\" (has leading zeros)\n",
    "- \"s0ubstitution\" (replaces an empty substring)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: word = \"internationalization\", abbr = \"i12iz4n\"\n",
    "- Output: true\n",
    "- Explanation: The word \"internationalization\" can be abbreviated as \"i12iz4n\" (\"i nternational iz atio n\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "- Input: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a2e\"\n",
    "- Output: false\n",
    "- Explanation: The word \"apple\" cannot be abbreviated as \"a2e\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The problem asks us to determine if a given abbreviation is valid for a target word. An abbreviation is considered valid if it can be derived from the target word by replacing one or more consecutive letters with their count. For example, 'a10n' is a valid abbreviation for 'abbreviation' because it represents the 10 letters between 'a' and 'n'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example to Illustrate\n",
    " \n",
    "- “For instance, consider the target word 'internationalization' and the abbreviation 'i12iz'. This is valid because it represents the letters between 'i' and 'z' (which are 12 characters long). However, 'i11iz' would not be valid because there are only 10 characters between 'i' and 'z'.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Approach\n",
    " \n",
    "a. Two-Pointer Technique\n",
    "- \"We will use a two-pointer technique to compare the characters in the target word and the abbreviation. One pointer will traverse the target word, and the other will traverse the abbreviation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Processing the Abbreviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"As we process the abbreviation:\n",
    "    - If the current character is a letter, we check if it matches the current character in the target word. If it does, we move both pointers forward.\n",
    "    - If the current character is a digit, we need to handle it as a count of skipped characters in the target word. We extract the full number (which can be more than one digit) and advance the pointer in the target word accordingly, skipping that many characters.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Validation\n",
    "- \"After processing both the abbreviation and the target word, we ensure that we've traversed the entire abbreviation and that our pointer has reached the end of the target word.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The time complexity of this approach is  O(N+M), where N is the length of the target word and M is the length of the abbreviation. This is because we traverse both strings at most once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Code Implementation\n",

    "    We need to check if there are two elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that add up to a given value k. This problem resembles the classic \"Two Sum\" problem but on a BST. Due to the BST properties, we can leverage a combination of in-order traversal and a hash set to check if the required pair exists.\n",

    "    In-Order Traversal: Using in-order traversal on a BST gives us nodes in sorted order. We can use this to go through each node in the tree.\n",

    "    DFS Traversal: We perform depth-first search (DFS) using recursion, which allows us to traverse the BST and check each node.\n",

    "    Add to Set: If no match is found, we add node.val to seen and continue our search.\n",

    "# Toeplitz Matrix\n",
    " \n",
    "    Given an m x n matrix, return true if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,1,2,3],[9,5,1,2]]\n",
    "    Output: true\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    In the above grid, the diagonals are:\n",
    "    \"[9]\", \"[5, 5]\", \"[1, 1, 1]\", \"[2, 2, 2]\", \"[3, 3]\", \"[4]\".\n",
    "    In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.\n",

    "    Output: false\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    The diagonal \"[1, 2]\" has different elements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem is straightforward since it only requires checking if the elements along each diagonal of the matrix are the same.\n",
    "    We can utilize a simple double loop to traverse the matrix efficiently, checking the necessary conditions without any complex data structures.\n",
    "    The solution is efficient given the constraints (maximum 20x20 matrix), making it feasible to compare elements directly without concern for performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we potentially visit every element of the matrix once.\n",
    "Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "    The space complexity is O(1) if we only consider the space used for variables (as we're not using any additional data structures that scale with input size).\n",
    "    If we account for the input matrix, the space complexity could be considered O(m * n), but since we're assuming the matrix is given and not created anew, we mainly focus on the space used for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialization: Get the number of rows and columns in the matrix.\n",
    "    Iterate Through the Matrix: Use nested loops to traverse the matrix.\n",
    "        For each element, check if it’s not in the first row or first column.\n",
    "        Compare the current element with the element diagonally above it (matrix[i - 1][j - 1]).\n",
    "    Check Conditions: If any element does not match, return False.\n",
    "    Return True: If all diagonals have the same elements, return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-Up Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "If the matrix is stored on disk and memory is limited, consider these approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Loading One Row at a Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Load each row from the disk and compare it with the previous row, ensuring that diagonal elements are consistent with the previous row.\n",
    "    Partial Row Loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "        If only a portion of a row can be loaded, you can buffer the last row in memory and check the necessary diagonal elements as you read the next row."
