    "- A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on a key. It uses a hash function to map keys to specific indices (buckets) in an array, where the corresponding values are stored.In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you create a dictionary, Python uses a hash table to store key-value pairs, and it uses the hash values of the keys to quickly access the associated values.\n",
