    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a _______________.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "## Favorite Taylor Swift Song ##\n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite Taylor Swift song is \"Would've, Could've, Should've.\" This song is on her most recent album, Midnights. She released three more songs at 3 AM called Midnights (3 AM Edition), and that song was one of her bonus tracks. I thought the flow of the song was very good, and it maintained a consistent beat. It really did feel like a song that one would play at 3 AM in the morning when in deep thought. Since Swift's album was supposed to resemble her inner thoughts at midnight, and how she used to think deeply, the song \"Would've, Could've, Should've\" is the perfect embodiment of the message and theme that she wants to get across in this album. In addition, this song is a sequel to \"Dear John,\" which was about Taylor not liking the forced relationship that she had with a grown man, even though she was really young and felt that she was not ready for a relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an except of the chorus:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And now that I'm grown\n",
    "I'm scared of ghosts\n",
    "Memories feel like weapons\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is reminiscent of her memories of her not-so-good relationship with John. The compatibility of those two songs is quite commendable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also the song sounds very good, and who does not like listening to Taylor Swift? Right?"
