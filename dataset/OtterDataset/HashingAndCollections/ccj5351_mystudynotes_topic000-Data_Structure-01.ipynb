    "> - We visualize the worst-case time of a downheap with a proxy path that goes first right and then repeatedly goes left until the bottom of the heap (this path may differ from the actual downheap path)\n",
    "> - Since each node is traversed by at most two proxy paths, the total number of nodes of the proxy paths is O(n). Note that for any two internal nodes, say, $u$ and $v$ of $T$, paths $p(u)$ and $p(v)$ do not share edges, although they may share nodes (see the Fig below). Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the paths associated with the internal nodes of $T$ is no more than the number of edges of heap $T$, that is, no more than $2n$.\n",

    "> Recall that the main idea of a hash table is to take a bucket array, A, and a hash function, h, and use them to implement a dictionary by storing each item `(k, e)` in the \"bucket\" A[h(k)]. This simple idea is challenged, however, when we have two distinct keys, $k_1$ and $k_2$, such that $h(k_1) = h(k_2)$. The existence of such **collisions** prevents us from simply inserting a new item `(k, e)` directly in the bucket `A[h(k)]`. They also complicate our procedure for performing the `findElement(k)` operation. Thus, we need consistent strategies for resolving collisions.\n",
