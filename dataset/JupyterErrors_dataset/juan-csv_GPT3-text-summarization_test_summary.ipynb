    "segments = [\"\\\"Can you taste words?\\\" It was a question\\nthat caught me by surprise. This summer, I was giving a talk\\nat a literary festival, and afterwards, as I was signing books, a teenage girl came with her friend, and this is what she asked me. I told her that some people\\nexperience an overlap in their senses so that they could hear colors or see sounds, and many writers were fascinated\\nby this subject, myself included. But she cut me off, a bit impatiently,\\nand said, \\\"Yeah, I know all of that. It's called synesthesia. We learned it at school. But my mom is reading your book, and she says there's lots\\nof food and ingredients and a long dinner scene in it. She gets hungry at every page. So I was thinking, how come you don't\\nget hungry when you write? And I thought maybe,\\nmaybe you could taste words. Does it make sense?\\\" And, actually, it did make sense, because ever since my childhood, each letter in the alphabet\\nhas a different color, and colors bring me flavors. So for instance, the color purple\\nis quite pungent, almost perfumed, and any words that I associate with purple taste the same way, such as \\\"sunset\\\" -- a very spicy word. But I was worried that if I tell\\nall of this to the teenager, it might sound either too abstract or perhaps too weird, and there wasn't enough time anyhow, because people were waiting in the queue, so it suddenly felt like\\nwhat I was trying to convey was more complicated and detailed than what the circumstances\\nallowed me to say. And I did what I usually do\\nin similar situations: I stammered, I shut down,\\nand I stopped talking. I stopped talking because\\nthe truth was complicated, even though I knew, deep within, that one should never, ever\\nremain silent for fear of complexity. So I want to start my talk today with the answer that I was not able\\nto give on that day. Yes, I can taste words -- sometimes, that is, not always, and happy words have\\na different flavor than sad words. I like to explore: What does\\nthe word \\\"creativity\\\" taste like, or \\\"equality,\\\" \\\"love,\\\" \\\"revolution?\\\" And what about \\\"motherland?\\\" These days, it's particularly\\nthis last word that troubles me. It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue, like cinnamon, a bit of rose water and golden apples. But underneath, there's a sharp tang, like nettles and dandelion. The taste of my motherland, Turkey, is a mixture of sweet and bitter. And the reason why I'm telling you this is because I think\\nthere's more and more people all around the world today who have similarly mixed emotions about the lands they come from. We love our native countries, yeah? How can we not? We feel attached to the people,\\nthe culture, the land, the food. And yet at the same time, we feel increasingly frustrated\\nby its politics and politicians, sometimes to the point\\nof despair or hurt or anger. I want to talk about emotions and the need to boost\\nour emotional intelligence. I think it's a pity that mainstream political theory\\npays very little attention to emotions. Oftentimes, analysts and experts\\nare so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget\\nthose things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster\\nunder statistical models. But I think this is a mistake,\\nfor two main reasons. Firstly, because we are emotional beings. As human beings,\\nI think we all are like that. But secondly, and this is new, we have entered\\na new stage in world history in which collective sentiments\\nguide and misguide politics more than ever before.\", \"Ours is the age of anxiety, anger, distrust, resentment and, I think, lots of fear. But here's the thing: even though there's plenty of research\\nabout economic factors, there's relatively few studies\\nabout emotional factors. Why is it that we underestimate\\nfeelings and perceptions? I think it's going to be one\\nof our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems\\nare replete with emotions. In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians\\nexploiting these emotions. And yet within the academia\\nand among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously. I think we should. And just like we should focus\\non economic inequality worldwide, we need to pay more attention\\nto emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide and how to bridge these gaps, because they do matter.\", \"And at some point\\nin our exchange, she said, \\\"I understand why you're a feminist, because, you know, you live in Turkey.\\\" And I said to her, \\\"I don't understand\\nwhy you're not a feminist, because, you know, you live in America.\\\" (Laughter) (Applause) And she laughed. She took it as a joke, and the moment passed. (Laughter) But the way she had divided the world\\ninto two imaginary camps, into two opposite camps -- it bothered me and it stayed with me.\", \"They were like choppy waters\\nnot yet settled. Some other parts of the world,\\nnamely the West, were solid, safe and stable. So it was the liquid lands\\nthat needed feminism and activism and human rights, and those of us who were\\nunfortunate enough to come from such places had to keep struggling\\nfor these most essential values. But there was hope. Since history moved forward, even the most unsteady lands\\nwould someday catch up. And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands could take comfort\\nin the progress of history and in the triumph of the liberal order. They could support the struggles\\nof other people elsewhere, but they themselves\\ndid not have to struggle for the basics of democracy anymore, because they were beyond that stage. I think in the year 2016, this hierarchical geography\\nwas shattered to pieces. Our world no longer follows\\nthis dualistic pattern in the scholar's mind, if it ever did. Now we know that history\\ndoes not necessarily move forward. Sometimes it draws circles, even slides backwards, and that generations\\ncan make the same mistakes that their great-grandfathers had made. And now we know that there's no such thing as solid countries\\nversus liquid countries. In fact, we are all living\\nin liquid times, just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us. And Bauman had another\\ndefinition for our age. He used to say we are all going\\nto be walking on moving sands. And if that's the case, I think, it should concern us women more than men, because when societies\\nslide backwards into authoritarianism, nationalism or religious fanaticism, women have much more to lose. That is why this needs\\nto be a vital moment, not only for global activism, but in my opinion,\\nfor global sisterhood as well. (Applause) But I want to make a little confession\\nbefore I go any further. Until recently, whenever I took part in\\nan international conference or festival, I would be usually one\\nof the more depressed speakers. (Laughter) Having seen how our dreams of democracy\\nand how our dreams of coexistence were crushed in Turkey, both gradually but also\\nwith a bewildering speed, over the years I've felt\\nquite demoralized. And at these festivals there would be\\nsome other gloomy writers, and they would come from places\\nsuch as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines,\\nChina, Venezuela, Russia. And we would smile\\nat each other in sympathy, this camaraderie of the doomed. (Laughter) And you could call us WADWIC: Worried and Depressed\\nWriters International Club.\", \"I remember -- (Laughter) I remember Greek writers and poets\\njoined first, came on board. And then writers from Hungary and Poland, and then, interestingly, writers\\nfrom Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then writers from the UK,\\nwhere I live and where I call my home, and then writers from the USA. Suddenly, there were more of us feeling worried about\\nthe fate of our nations and the future of the world. And maybe there were more of us now feeling like strangers\\nin our own motherlands. And then this bizarre thing happened. Those of us who used to be\\nvery depressed for a long time, we started to feel less depressed, whereas the newcomers,\\nthey were so not used to feeling this way that they were now even more depressed. (Laughter) So you could see writers\\nfrom Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt trying to console their colleagues from Brexit Britain\\nor from post-election USA. (Laughter) But joking aside, I think our world is full\\nof unprecedented challenges, and this comes with an emotional backlash, because in the face of high-speed change, many people wish to slow down, and when there's too much unfamiliarity, people long for the familiar.\", \"This is a very dangerous crossroads, because it's exactly where the demagogue\\nenters into the picture. The demagogue understands\\nhow collective sentiments work and how he -- it's usually a he --\\ncan benefit from them. He tells us that we all\\nbelong in our tribes, and he tells us that we will be safer\\nif we are surrounded by sameness.\", \"This could be the eccentric leader\\nof a marginal political party somewhere in Europe, or an Islamist extremist imam\\npreaching dogma and hatred, or it could be a white supremacist\\nNazi-admiring orator somewhere else. All these figures, at first glance --\\nthey seem disconnected. But I think they feed each other, and they need each other. And all around the world, when we look at how demagogues talk\\nand how they inspire movements, I think they have one\\nunmistakable quality in common: they strongly, strongly dislike plurality. They cannot deal with multiplicity. Adorno used to say, \\\"Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign\\nof an authoritarian personality.\\\" But I ask myself: What if that same sign, that same intolerance of ambiguity -- what if it's the mark of our times,\\nof the age we're living in? Because wherever I look,\\nI see nuances withering away.\", \"Yeah? It's good ratings. It's even better\\nif they shout at each other. Even in academia, where our intellect\\nis supposed to be nourished, you see one atheist scholar\\ncompeting with a firmly theist scholar, but it's not a real intellectual exchange, because it's a clash\\nbetween two certainties. I think binary oppositions are everywhere. So slowly and systematically, we are being denied the right\\nto be complex.\", \"And when you express your sorrow,\\nand when you react against the cruelty, you get all kinds of reactions, messages on social media. But one of them is quite disturbing, only because it's so widespread. They say, \\\"Why do you feel sorry for them? Why do you feel sorry for them? Why don't you feel sorry\\nfor civilians in Yemen or civilians in Syria?\\\" And I think the people\\nwho write such messages do not understand that we can feel sorry for\\nand stand in solidarity with victims of terrorism and violence\\nin the Middle East, in Europe, in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere, equally and simultaneously. They don't seem to understand\\nthat we don't have to pick one pain and one place over all others. But I think this is what\\ntribalism does to us. It shrinks our minds, for sure, but it also shrinks our hearts, to such an extent that we become numb\\nto the suffering of other people. And the sad truth is,\\nwe weren't always like this.\", \"I went to many primary schools, which gave me a chance to observe\\nyounger kids in Turkey. And it was always amazing to see\\nhow much empathy, imagination and chutzpah they have. These children are much more inclined\\nto become global citizens than nationalists at that age. And it's wonderful to see,\\nwhen you ask them, so many of them want\\nto be poets and writers, and girls are just as confident as boys, if not even more. But then I would go to high schools, and everything has changed. Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore, now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore, and girls have become timid, they are cautious, guarded, reluctant to speak up in the public space, because we have taught them -- the family, the school, the society -- we have taught them\\nto erase their individuality. I think East and West, we are losing multiplicity, both within our societies\\nand within ourselves. And coming from Turkey,\\nI do know that the loss of diversity is a major, major loss.\", \"And I also believe that what happened\\nover there in Turkey can happen anywhere. It can even happen here. So just like solid countries\\nwas an illusion, singular identities is also an illusion, because we all have\\na multiplicity of voices inside. The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz, used to say, \\\"You carry in your soul\\nevery ingredient necessary to turn your existence into joy. All you have to do\\nis to mix those ingredients.\\\" And I think mix we can. I am an Istanbulite, but I'm also attached to the Balkans, the Aegean, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Levant. I am a European by birth, by choice, the values that I uphold. I have become a Londoner over the years. I would like to think of myself\\nas a global soul, as a world citizen, a nomad and an itinerant storyteller. I have multiple attachments,\\njust like all of us do.\", \"As writers, we always\\nchase stories, of course, but I think we are also\\ninterested in silences, the things we cannot talk about, political taboos, cultural taboos. We're also interested in our own silences. I have always been very vocal\\nabout and written extensively about minority rights, women's rights, LGBT rights. But as I was thinking about this TED Talk, I realized one thing: I have never had the courage\\nto say in a public space that I was bisexual myself, because I so feared the slander and the stigma and the ridicule and the hatred that was sure to follow. But of course, one should never,\\never, remain silent for fear of complexity. (Applause) And although I am\\nno stranger to anxieties, and although I am talking here\\nabout the power of emotions -- I do know the power of emotions -- I have discovered over time that emotions are not limitless. You know? They have a limit. There comes a moment -- it's like a tipping point\\nor a threshold -- when you get tired of feeling afraid, when you get tired of feeling anxious. And I think not only individuals, but perhaps nations, too,\\nhave their own tipping points. So even stronger than my emotions is my awareness that not only gender, not only identity, but life itself is fluid. They want to divide us into tribes, but we are connected across borders. They preach certainty, but we know that life has plenty of magic and plenty of ambiguity. And they like to incite dualities, but we are far more nuanced than that. So what can we do? I think we need to go back to the basics, back to the colors of the alphabet. The Lebanese poet\\nKhalil Gibran used to say, \\\"I learned silence from the talkative and tolerance from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind.\\\" I think it's a great motto for our times. So from populist demagogues, we will learn the indispensability of democracy. And from isolationists, we will learn\\nthe need for global solidarity. And from tribalists, we will learn\\nthe beauty of cosmopolitanism and the beauty of diversity. As I finish, I want to leave you\\nwith one word, or one taste. The word \\\"yurt\\\" in Turkish\\nmeans \\\"motherland.\\\" It means \\\"homeland.\\\" But interestingly, the word also means \\\"a tent used by nomadic tribes.\\\" And I like that combination,\\nbecause it makes me think homelands do not need\\nto be rooted in one place. They can be portable. We can take them with us everywhere. And I think for writers, for storytellers, at the end of the day, there is one main homeland, and it's called \\\"Storyland.\\\" And the taste of that word is the taste of freedom. Thank you. (Applause)\"]"

    "#input_text = \"\"\"Computing VRA are and AI workloads but having another viable GPU out there. To do GPU things in a world that doesn't have enough. Gpus does seem like a good GPU thing. And we do have a vague idea of the potential performance and I mean very vague but it is something thanks to German website Golem dot. D e, who uncovered that Feng Hua number ones. Chip based design is built on underlying technology from powervr. And powervr is owned by British company. Imagination Technologies who was acquired by a Chinese investor group called Canyon Bridge, Capital Partners in 2017, Canyon Bridge puts imagination in touch within 0, silicon and there. Go, the best-known powervr, GPU configuration right now would push about six teraflops FP 32, though, in terms of raw performance, which would very theoretically put it in the same league as an Nvidia, r-tx, 2060 or a Radeon RX 580. Speaking of the r-tx 2060. It really does sound like, Nvidia will be bringing it out of retirement. For one more round with a doubled up memory allotment increasing from six to twelve gigabytes of gddr5 6. The r-tx 2060 originally launched in January, 2019, that magical time when GPU Jews were plentiful and there were at least slightly fewer justifications for your chronic existential. Dread the 12 gig 2060 seems all but assured now though as the blabbermouths at the Eurasian economic commission, have once again, broadcasted early info for gigabyte model numbers for cards that they recently registered indicating that the 12 NM gpus are in production. Once again, it's still unknown which die variant. It would ship with as there are several that would fit including the TU 10 6-4. 10 from the 20. 60 super that has more Cuda, cores. Hope is that these might not just sell out at MSRP like every other GPU but r-tx 2060. Mining profitability is still decent and used six gig cards or selling for five to six hundred dollars. So don't get your hopes up still, any available GPU in the budget range would be better than nothing or better than gt7. Tens and 7 30s, which are worse than nothing because of the terrible curse, that they carry the unconcerned announcement date for the 12. Gig 2060 is December 7th for now, but that's not all Nvidia has another bone to throw. Hungry, PC Gamers and it's called Nvidia image scaling which isn't DLS, s. But kind of does a similar Thing by making frames rendered at lower resolutions. Look better, allowing for better frame rates. It is actually just an upgrade to Nvidia has existing image scalar. So it's more like, amd's Fidelity, FX super resolution and it's going to be open source, like am DFS are too. Hey, what a coincidence that means in video image. Scaling could also work on AMD and Intel gpus and sure maybe even the fenghuang number one to eventually. So even if this Just Nvidia saying hey we can do FS are too, it's another tool Gamers can use to eke a few more frames out of their gpus which will be, especially welcome to those who are still doing their best to get by with aging graphics cards. Those of you who are struggling through these dark times with nothing but a Radeon HD 6850 or a GTX 970 3.5 gig to support your gaming needs, can at least take solace in the fact that GPU manufacturers themselves are making huge steaming, but loads of cash mountains of money, a veritable, golden shower of actual gold bars case in point on Wednesday and video, CEO. And man, who I really hope signs the adoption papers. I sent. Tim Jensen Wang revealed their revenue for the last quarter and all-time record, 7.1 billion dollars up 50% year-over-year and also probably too much money. I'm expecting the realize that soon and announced partial refunds for anyone who has bought an overpriced GPU in the past year. Last line was a joke just to be clear. Please don't contact me because Nvidia won't give you money. If you're wondering where in video will go from here, though. Don't worry. The next GPU challenge, has already arrived in the form of these.\"\"\""

      "The speaker discusses how, in the year 2016, the dualistic pattern in the scholar's mind of solid countries versus liquid countries was shattered. They explain that now we know that history does not necessarily move forward, and that sometimes it draws circles or slides backwards. Additionally, they say that we are all living in liquid times. The speaker goes on to say that, because societies can slide backwards into authoritarianism, nationalism, or religious fanaticism, women have much more to lose than men. They end their talk by confessing that, until recently, they were usually one of the more depressed speakers at international conferences and festivals.\n",
