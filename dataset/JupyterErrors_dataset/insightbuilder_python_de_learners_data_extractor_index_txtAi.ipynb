However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a\\nunique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices\\n(approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased\\nparietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25–40 Hz), wasnot related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime dailymeditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in\\nspontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-\\nlasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function.\\nCitation: Ferrarelli F, Smith R, Dentico D, Riedner BA, Zennig C, et al.

Accumulating evidence suggests that meditation traininginduces functional and anatomical neuronal changes [1],[2,3].These neuroplastic changes are linked to changes in behaviorduring cognitive and affective tasks [4],[3]. The investigation ofspontaneous brain activity, at rest or during practice, is a sensitiveapproach to identify these neuroplastic changes. Some studiesfound meditation-related increases in alpha and theta frequency\\nbands, particularly in frontal midline and prefrontal areas, which\\nwere associated with increased relaxation (reviewed in [5]).Another study showed that long-term meditators (LTM) hadhigh-amplitude gamma band (25–40 Hz) oscillations duringmental practice localized to lateral frontal and posterior parietalelectrodes bilaterally [6]. A gamma power increase in a parietal-occipital region was also reported in another group of LTM duringVipassana meditation [7], whereas in a recent EEG studymeditation experts showed higher parietal-occipital gamma powercompared to novices during resting wakefulness preceding\\nmeditation practice [8].\\nAn important question raised by these studies is whether\\nenhanced EEG activity is state dependent (e.g.– occurring only\\nduring meditation and immediately after it), or trait dependent\\n(e.g. – occurring outside of formal meditation practice) [5]. Thelatter would suggests that long-term meditation training causes\\nlasting neuro-plastic changes in cortico-thalamic circuits, which\\nshould be detected in the spontaneous brain activity [9]. Thisquestion is difficult to address because meditation training occurs\\nat multiple time-scales. For example it can happen intensively, as\\nduring meditation retreats, or less intensively but across a longerperiod, as during daily practice. Training also occurs, in different\\ncontexts, either during formal practice, or when the practitioner\\nintentionally cultivates meditative qualities within her/his dailyactivities. Another critical methodological issue is that resting state\\nin meditation experts may be an elusive concept. Indeed, it is\\npossible that during wakefulness a meditator may spontaneouslyenter a meditative state while \"at rest\" as a consequence of his/her\\nlevel of training. However, during sleep brain activity is directed\\nby neither conscious effort nor attention, but rather reflects theintrinsic function of cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic circuits\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e73417' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/Ferrarelli 2013 Experienced Mindfulness Meditators.pdf', 'page': 0}\n",
            "page_content='[10]. Thus, the examination of sleep EEG is an effective means to\\nidentify individual trait differences in the brain unconfounded bythe effect of meditation on waking mentation. [11].\\nThe recent availability of high-density electroencephalography\\n(hdEEG) has greatly enhanced the spatial resolution of standardEEG recordings, thus allowing for better characterization of localplastic changes [12],[13],[14],[15]. HdEEG studies of sleeprhythms, with good spatial and temporal resolution, are extremelysensitive measures of changes in the activity in corticothalamiccircuits. For example, we previously showed that slow wave\\nparameters, such as amplitude and slope, display local changes in\\nthe brain in response to learning [16],[17],[12]. Moreover, wehave demonstrated that sleep spindle activity is decreased inschizophrenic subjects compared to controls [14]. Finally, gammapower has been shown to increase during NREM sleep in humansubjects following declarative learning [18].\\nHere we performed whole night sleep hdEEG (256-channels) in\\nexperienced meditators (LTM) and meditation naive individualsmatched for age and sex. Even if this is a correlative and not acausal approach, it paves the way for studies on long term plasticeffects of meditation on brain activity in healthy humans.\\nMaterials and Methods\\nParticipants\\nTwenty-nine right-handed long-term meditators (LTM, mean\\nage = 50.7 610.4, 15 female) and a group of twenty-nine\\nmeditation naive subjects matched for age and sex were recruited.LTM had a history of daily meditation practice of at least 3 yearsand had participated in at least 3 one-week intensive retreats.Mean duration of meditation training was 15.6 years ( 67.8, SD).\\nNaive subjects had no previous experience with meditation. AllLTM participants were proficient in meditation practices, astaught within the framework of either Theravada or TibetanBuddhisms. These practices included two attention-based medita-tions, which we referred to as open monitoring (OM) and focusedattention (FA), as well as one compassion/loving kindnessmeditation referred to as metta meditation [1] (Table 1). Briefly,FA meditation involves directing and sustaining attention on aselected object (e.g., breathing), detecting mind wandering anddistractors (e.g., thoughts), as well as disengagement of attentionfrom distractors and shifting of the focus of attention back to theselected object. By contrast, OM meditation has no explicit focusof attention, but rather requires nonreactive meta cognitivemonitoring of anything that is experienced, thus replacing the\"effortful\" selection of an object as primary focus with an\"effortless\" sustained awareness of the rich features of eachexperience [1]. The practice of compassion/loving kindnessmeditation is a form of concentration practice where thepractitioner focuses his/her mind on the suffering of oneself orothers and then on the wish that the individual(s) in question maybe happy and free from suffering. After an initial phone screeningto collect the medical and psychiatric history, each subjectunderwent a thorough in-person screening, which included several\\nquestionnaires (see below). Sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-\\nrelated movement disorders were also established/excluded within-laboratory polysomnography (see below). All subjects providedwritten informed consent and were instructed to maintain regularsleep-wake schedules in the week preceding EEG recordings. Thisstudy was approved by the Institutional Review Board of theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison.Study design\\nAll subjects underwent in-laboratory hdEEG polysomnography\\n(PSG) that utilized 256 channel hdEEG (Electrical Geodesics Inc.,\\nEugene, OR), as well as standard sleep monitoring leads, includingelectrooculogram, sub-mental electromyogram, electrocardio-\\ngram, bilateral tibial electromyogram, respiratory inductance\\nplethysmography, pulse oximetry, and a position sensor. Partic-ipants arrived at the laboratory between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. forset-up that took approximately two hours. Baseline EEG and an\\nattention and a fear conditioning task were performed. After 9pm\\nthe participants were allowed to sleep undisturbed in thelaboratory beginning within one hour of their usual bedtime.\\nAdditional measures were collected the next day. In this report we\\nwill focus only on the EEG data during sleep.\\nSelf reported measures\\nThe socioeconomic status (SES) measure (Socioeconomic status\\nwas measured with the Hollingshead Index of Social Position,[19]) was administered to assess the level of education. The Quick\\nInventory of Depressive Symptoms [20] and the Symptom\\nChecklist-90-Revised [21] were collected to exclude currentdepression and other mental health issues. The cut-off for\\nexclusion was a score ,2 for both questionnaires. Additionally,\\neach participant completed validated sleep rating scales, includingthe Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) [22], the Fatigue Severity Scale\\n(FSS) [23], the Epworth Sleepiness Scale [24], a sleep history\\nquestionnaire, and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale [25] to assess forsymptoms of common sleep disorders, such as restless legssyndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Thresholds for exclusion\\nwere an ISI .10 and/or an FSS .4 and/or an ESS .9.\\nMeditation Practice\\nLTM had an average of 8762 lifetime hours of meditation\\npractice, ranging from 1,526 to 32,349 total hours. Thecomputation of lifetime hours of practice was based on subjects’\\nreports of their average hours of formal (sitting and walking)\\nmeditation practice per week, including time spent on meditationretreats (for details see Table 1).\\nSleep PSG assessment and hdEEG data analysis\\nSleep staging, which was based on six mastoid-referenced\\nchannels (F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, and O2), a sub-mental electro-\\nmyogram and an electrooculogram, was performed by a registered\\npolysomnographic technologist in 30-second epochs according tostandard criteria [26] using Alice HSleepware (Philips Respironics,\\nMurrysville, PA) The sleep technician was blind to group\\nassignment. PSG recordings were reviewed by a board certifiedsleep medicine physician, who was able to confirm the absence of\\nsleep disorders in 26 out of 29 LTM. Two LTM met the clinical\\ncriteria for sleep-related movement disorders (periodic limbmovement arousal index .10/h), while one had sleep-disordered\\nbreathing (apnea–hypopnea index .10/h). As a result, data from\\nthese three LTM (as well as from the age- and sex- matched\\nmeditation naives) were not further analyzed. All-night sleephdEEG recordings were collected with vertex-referencing, using a\\nNetAmps 300 amplifier and NetStation software (Electrical\\nGeodesics Inc., Eugene, OR). EEG data were sampled at500 Hz, and a first-order high-pass filter (Kaiser type, 0.1 Hz)was applied to eliminate the DC shift. Data were then band-pass\\nfiltered (1–50 Hz), down-sampled to 128 Hz and average-refer-\\nenced to the mean power in all channels. Spectral analysis wasperformed for each channel in six-second epochs (Welch’s\\naveraged modified periodogram with a Hamming window).

EEG channels inwhich artifacts affected most of the recording were excluded. REMsleep epochs were visually analyzed and divided in tonic andphasic (i.e., characterized by rapid eye movements). To eliminateartifacts distinctively observed during REM sleep (i.e., muscletwitches, eye movements, heartbeats), independent componentanalysis (ICA) was performed [29]. After removal of ICAcomponents, power spectral of tonic and phasic REM epochswas computed. We computed six frequency ranges (delta: 1–4.5 Hz, theta: 4.5–8 Hz, alpha: 8–12 Hz, sigma; 12–15 Hz, beta:15–25 Hz, and gamma: 25–40 Hz) consistent with previousstudies from our lab [30]. In order to determine whether groupdifferences in NREM gamma activity were related to increasedmuscle tone or variation in saccades, we compared the power inthe gamma band in neck EMG and EOG derivations [30]between LTM and meditation naive participants.\\nSleep cycles were defined according to the modified criteria [31]\\nof Feinberg and Floyd [32] also consistent with our previousstudies [33].\\nStatistics\\nDifferences in clinical as well as sleep architecture variables\\nwere examined using 2-tailed, unpaired t-tests. Topographicalanalysis was computed after spatially normalizing each subject’stopography (z-score across all channels) within the frequencybands of interest as a means to reduce between-subject variance.Group differences in topographical NREM and REM sleephdEEG power were assessed with statistical non-parametricmapping (SnPM) using a suprathreshold cluster test to identifysignificant groups of electrodes after accounting for the multiplecomparisons due to the numerous electrodes [34]. Briefly, anappropriate threshold t-value was chosen (t = 2, corresponding toa= 0.05 for the given degrees of freedom) before topographic\\npower maps were randomly shuffled between groups (LTM andmeditation naive individuals). The size of the largest cluster abovethe threshold for each reshuffling was then used to create a clustersize distribution. Given the impracticality of computing all possiblecombinations (4.96 61014), 50000 unique combinations were run\\nfor each comparison in order to approximate the actual clusterdistribution. The suprathreshold cluster p-value was then deter-\\nmined by comparison of the true cluster size against the\\napproximate maximal cluster size distribution. Bonferroni correc-tion of the p value was performed to account for the 18 testsderiving from separately evaluating 6 different frequency bands\\nover the course of 3 distinct phases of sleep.\\nThe magnitude of NREM sleep EEG gamma power differences\\nbetween LTM and meditation naive individuals was assessed with\\nthe Cohen’s d, a measure of the effect size [35]. We also performed\\ncorrelation analysis between duration of meditation practice inLTM and NREM sleep EEG gamma power, as well as TST and\\nWASO. Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB (The\\nMathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) and STATISTICA (StatSoft Inc.,\\nTulsa, OK). Non-parametric statistics were used to assess group\\ndifferences in EMG, EOG, and global EEG gamma power\\n(Wilcoxon rank sum test), as well as to correlate gamma power\\nwith variables of interest (Spearman rank correlation). An outlier\\nsubject was excluded from the correlation between EEG gamma\\npower and hours of daily practice in LTM based on a suspected\\nover inflation of daily practice (value above 1.5 interquartile ranges\\nfrom the 75th percentile).

These sleep\\nparameters did not show a correlation with daily meditation\\npractice. By contrast, the two groups did not differ in sleep onset\\nlatency or in the relative time (% of TST) spent in each sleep stage\\nand did not differ in the number of arousals (Table 2).\\nLTM had higher NREM sleep gamma power compared to\\nmeditation naives in a parietal-occipital brain region\\nWe first checked for global, frequency non-specific differences,\\nby comparing the absolute average power across the spectrum\\nbetween the groups.

Suprathreshold clusteranalysis, a statistical non parametric mapping test (SnPM) whichcorrects for the multiple comparison problem resulting from thenumerous individual electrode tests inherent in hdEEG analysis,confirmed that a parieto-occipital cluster (N = 39 electrodes)\\nshowed significantly higher relative gamma power in LTM\\ncompared to meditation naive subjects (SnPM, p = 0.002,Figure 1, bottom right). This result survived Bonferroni correctionfor the 18 tests derived from separately evaluating 6 differentfrequency bands over the course of 3 distinct phases of sleep(p = 0.05/18 = 0.003). Therefore, we wanted to check whether thistopographical increase in gamma power was paralleled by adifference in the non-normalized gamma power between groups.We found a parieto-occipital cluster (N = 46 electrodes) largelyoverlapping the normalized cluster, that showed significantlyhigher absolute gamma power in LTM compared to meditationnaive subjects (SnPM, p = 0.036). We also examined whether thisresult was consistent across the night and found similar results inthe first three NREM cycles, although the magnitude of the resultin the first NREM cycle did not survive multiple comparisoncorrections after normalization (SnPM, normalized data, cycle 2:N = 20, p = 0.012, cycle 3: N = 30, p = 0.002; absolute data, cycle1: N = 37, p = 0.0250, cycle 2: N = 44, p = 0.021, cycle 3: N = 54,p = 0.020). Similar results were obtained when breaking downNREM by stages into N2 and N3, with only N2 surviving multiplecomparisons corrections after normalization (SnPM, normalizeddata, N2: N = 23, p = 0.010; absolute data, N2: N = 49, p = 0.019,N3, N = 51, p = 0.014). We suspect that the low values of gammaat the beginning of the night as well as during deep NREM sleepmake it difficult to appreciate a difference between groups andtherefore the effect is evident but less robust during these times.\\nWe found no gamma power difference in either the electro-\\nmyographic (EMG) or electrooculographic (EOG) derivationsbetween the two groups (p = 0.589 and p = 0.493 respectively)(Table 2), suggesting that the local gamma increase was not\\nartifactual. SnPM topographic analysis found no significantdifferences between the two groups for the other five frequencyranges.\\nLTM NREM sleep gamma power correlated with\\nmeditation training\\nTo further characterize the gamma increase at the individual\\nsubject level, we calculated the average NREM gamma power of\\nthe parietal-occipital cluster for each subject. The average clusterdifference in gamma power between groups was 35% (Figure 2,left panel) and the between group Cohen’s d was 0.8,\\ncorresponding to a large effect size (more than 50% separation\\nbetween LTM and meditation naives). We next investigatedwhether the cluster gamma power was significantly correlated withthe overall duration of meditation practice. We found a significant\\ncorrelation between parietal-occipital NREM gamma power and\\ndaily meditation practice, but not retreat time (rho = 0.475,p = 0.017, and rho = 0.029, p = 0.887, for daily practice andretreat time respectively). As gamma power in LTM was\\ncorrelated with age (rho = 0.487, p = 0.012), we further tested\\nwhether the age of meditation naive individuals predicted alsoEEG gamma power, but no correlation was found (rho = 20.035,\\np = 0.866).

This increase was specific for the gamma frequency range,was not found during REM sleep, and was positively correlated\\nwith the length of daily meditation practice.\\nThe LTMs recorded in this study were experienced in Focused\\nAttention (FA), Open Monitoring (OM), as well as loving\\nkindness/compassion meditations. An increase in gamma activitywas recently demonstrated in expert Buddhist practitioners\\n(.10.000 hours of practice) during a style of meditation which\\ncontains features of both loving kindness/compassion and OMmeditations [39]. Compared to a group of novices, the expert\\npractitioners showed self-induced, higher-amplitude, sustained\\nEEG gamma-band oscillations, especially over lateral frontal-parietal electrodes, while meditating as well as in the resting state\\nimmediately preceding and following meditation [6]. Notably, a\\nlink between higher gamma-band activity and stronger cognitivecontrol has been reported by a variety of human electrophysio-\\nlogical techniques, including magnetoencephalography (MEG)\\n[40], scalp EEG [41], and direct cortical recordings [42].Furthermore, a recent EEG study has found that LTM had\\nincreased gamma power in a parietal-occipital area compared to\\nmeditation naive individuals during resting state, as well as duringmeditation practice as compared to baseline [8]. Based on these\\nfindings, the authors concluded that enhanced posterior EEG\\ngamma power was a state (meditation-related), and to some sameextent trait (resting state associated) feature of meditation practice.\\nHere we established that LTM had higher EEG gamma power\\nover an extended period of spontaneous brain activity (i.e., whole\\nnight NREM sleep) compared to meditation naive individuals.\\nThis parietal-occipital gamma increase corresponded to a largeeffect size (ES = 0.8, allowing more than 50% separation between\\nmeditation experts and naives). These findings strongly suggest\\nthat changes in EEG gamma activity related to meditationpractice are trait (in addition to state) related. Comparing the\\nactivity of meditation experts and novices during an unambiguous\\nresting condition is a challenging task [5]. This is becauseexperienced long-term meditation experts are usually able to\\nblend formal meditation session with daily life, and that a\\nmeditator might spontaneously generate a meditative state whileat rest in the lab out of demand characteristic. In this regard, sleep\\nprovides an exquisite window to explore the spontaneous brain\\nactivity as well as the function of neural circuits at rest. Brainactivity during sleep does not require conscious effort or attention,\\nand a condition of physical immobility is obtained for several\\nhours. Moreover, the recently available combination of standardpolysomnography with hdEEG, which provides enhanced spatial\\nand temporal resolution, offers the opportunity to analyze in\\ngreater details NREM/REM sleep activity as well as to observelocal changes in brain function due to neuroplasticity [43],[16].\\nDaily practice and meditation retreat could contribute differ-\\nently to the neuroplastic changes induced by meditation. Forinstance, meditation frequency (days per week with meditation\\npractice) has recently been shown to reliably predict both higher\\nmindfulness and psychological well-being [44]. In this study weshowed that the daily practice, but not the retreat time, predictedthe parietal-occipital gamma activity during NREM sleep in\\nLTM. The differential effect of the amount of daily practice and of\\nretreat time on localized NREM gamma activity is to our\\nknowledge the first indication of a specific effect of constant\\nmeditation daily practice, but not of intensive retreat practice, onbrain neuroplasticity. On one side, this finding raises some\\nmethodological issues about how to quantify meditation practice,\\nsuggesting the potential usefulness of differentially investigating the\\ncontribution of retreat time and daily practice on behavioral and\\nphysiological measures. On the other side, it enhances the\\neffectiveness of our approach in revealing stable (trait-like) effects\\non brain functioning induced by prolonged training duringwaking.\\nIn the present study LTM had a significantly reduced total sleep\\ntime (TST) and increased wake after sleep onset (WASO)\\ncompared to meditation naive individuals. A reduction in TST\\nhas been recently reported by another sleep study in LTM [45],\\nand it indicates that meditation practice may decrease sleep needs.\\nHowever other studies [46,47] investigating sleep architecture\\ndidn’t find a reduction of TST, suggesting that the sleep\\narchitecture is not the most reliable parameter to study the effectof meditation on neuronal plasticity during sleep. Consistent with\\nthis idea, we did not find a correlation between the changes in any\\ntraditional polysomnographic sleep parameters and meditation\\npractice.\\nOnly a handful of studies so far have investigated the sleep EEG\\nactivity of meditation experts beyond sleep architecture. One of\\nthese studies explored EEG differences in thirteen individuals withat least 2 years of meditation experience during Transcendental\\nmeditation (TM; a form of meditation different from that explored\\nin the current study), resting wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep\\nand found a progressive slowing of the main EEG frequency from\\nwakefulness to sleep, with no appreciable change in power\\nbetween wakefulness and meditation EEG [48]. The authors also\\nanalyzed the EEG activity of meditation practitioners and ofmeditation naive control subjects during resting wakefulness, and\\nfound no difference in power but a slight slowing in the mean EEG\\nfrequency of the practitioners; however, they did not compare the\\nsleep EEG of these two groups [48]. Another study found that\\neleven long term TM practitioners had increased theta-alpha\\npower during slow wave sleep compared to nine short term\\npractitioners as well as eleven experienced practitioners [49]. Herewe found no difference in theta-alpha EEG power between LTM\\nand meditation naive individuals during NREM sleep. Differences\\nin style of meditation practices may account for the discrepancy of\\nthese findings. Furthermore, whereas we screened participants for\\nsleep disorders and performed PSG recordings during the first\\nhdEEG night, the LTM recorded by Mason et al. did not undergo\\nsuch screening. An EEG pattern of alpha wave in delta wave sleep(alpha-delta sleep) is commonly reported in individuals with sleep\\ndisturbances, including restless leg syndrome [50] and sleep apnea\\n[51], and is associated with increased arousability and lighter sleep\\n[52]. Notably, their LTM spent a significantly higher amount of\\ntime in light (N1) NREM sleep, while we found no difference in\\nN1 between LTM and meditation naive individuals. [45]And\\nfinally, the type of meditation practice examined in the currentstudy differs from the practice studied in these other studies.\\nWhat is the functional meaning of the gamma increase in LTM\\nthat was found here during NREM sleep? A large body of\\nevidence from animal and human recordings have suggested that\\ngamma-frequency activity is implicated during wakefulness in\\nplasticity-related processes, including attention, learning, as well as\\nboth working and long-term memory [53]. For instance, anincrease in gamma activity occurs when sensory stimuli areLocal NREM Sleep Gamma Increase in Meditators\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e73417' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/Ferrarelli 2013 Experienced Mindfulness Meditators.pdf', 'page': 5}\n",
            "page_content='attended [54], as well as during the active maintenance of\\nrepresentations during working memory tasks [55],[56]. Several\\nstudies employing EEG, MEG and intracranial EEG recordingshave also shown that gamma-frequency activity during encoding\\npredicts successful formation of long-term memory [57],[58].\\nLittle is still known about the functional significance of gammaactivity during sleep. In this study we found a gamma power\\nincrease in meditation experts during NREM sleep in a scalp\\nregion overlying posterior parietal and occipital cortical areas. Ourfinding is in line with the recent report of Valderrama et al., which\\nsuggested a functional significance for gamma oscillations during\\nNREM sleep in humans [59]. A possible confound in the study ofgamma activity is the presence of muscular or ocular artifacts in\\nthe scalp EEG. However, we found no difference in neck EMG\\nand EOG gamma power between LTM and meditation naiveindividuals. This result therefore strongly indicates that such\\nartifacts do not contribute significantly to our finding.\\nPrevious studies have reported an increase in fast-frequency\\nactivity during sleep in pathological conditions such as schizo-\\nphrenia, depression and insomnia [60],[61],[62]. This increase has\\nbeen associated with abnormalities in the arousal mechanisms[62]. However, this functional interpretation of gamma activity is\\nnot warranted for a number of reasons. First, we did not find a\\ngroup difference in arousal. Our finding was specific to spatiallynormalized gamma activity. Furthermore, the topography of the\\ncurrent finding over parietal-occipital electrodes differed from\\nthose earlier findings. Finally inter-individual variability in gammaactivity among meditators predicted daily meditation experience\\nin life, which has been found to predict positive mental health\\noutcomes [44],[1]. Instead, we speculate here the specific gammaincrease is not pathological, but reflects the lasting, plastic effect on\\nspecific neuronal circuits of long-term meditation practice. For\\ninstance, the parietal cortex has been implicated in directing thefocus of attention on a specific object [63], a cognitive skill\\nperfected by attention-based meditation [1]. The finding of higher\\nwhole night NREM gamma power in LTM compared tomeditation naives could therefore reflect an increase in activity\\nand connectivity within these neuronal circuits due to extensive\\nmeditation training. Consistent with this assumption, here weestablished that NREM sleep gamma band power correlated with\\nthe duration of daily meditation practice in LTM. This finding not\\nonly confirms a previous report from our group that the amount ofEEG gamma power generated during meditation by LTM\\ncorrelated with the length of their meditation training [6], but\\nalso suggests that EEG gamma activity during sleep may represent\\na trait-like sensitive measure for the neuronal plastic changes\\ndetermined over time by meditative training.\\nThe increase in NREM sleep parieto-occipital gamma power\\nreported here could also reflect an enhanced activity of the\\nunderlying cortical areas in LTM compared to meditation naives.Higher EEG gamma power reflects higher firing rates of the\\nunderlying neuronal populations [64], and local changes in\\ngamma oscillations closely mirror underlying activity in bothvisual [65],[66] and parietal default network-associated cortical\\nregions [67],[68]. During NREM sleep both neuronal firing and\\ngamma power tend to decrease, as does the ability to processsensory information [69],[70]. Thus, a higher gamma activity in\\nLTM could reflect a partially maintained capacity of parieto-\\noccipital sensory and default network-associated areas to processinformation and maintain some level of awareness, even during a\\nstate when usually these cognitive functions are greatly impaired.\\nConsistent with this idea, a higher incidence of dream reports hasbeen found in meditation experts compared to meditation naives\\neven during the deepest stages of NREM sleep [71]. If experiencedmeditators retain a higher capacity for internal information\\nprocessing and awareness during NREM sleep compared tomeditation naives, such advantage should be reduced during REMsleep, when these functions are partially restored and spontaneousneuronal firing/gamma activity is enhanced compared to NREMsleep [72]. In this study we found that LTM had only a slight, nonsignificant increase in REM sleep EEG gamma power comparedto meditation naives in the same parietal-occipital regions (FigureS1).\\nLimitations of the study include a lack of an adaptation night,\\nwhich could account for the truncated sleep time ( ,7 hrs) in all\\nparticipants, but it is unlikely to explain the observed groupdifference in the sleep EEG. Future work will also need to addresssome of the questions left unanswered in the present study. Forexample, the relationship found here between higher EEG gammaactivity and longer meditation daily practice suggests that gammapower is a good correlate of meditation training. This correlationshould be confirmed in longitudinal studies performing EEGrecordings in meditation naive individuals before and aftermeditation training, ideally using only one style of meditationpractice. It will also be important to investigate whether theobserved gamma increase may be affected by pre-existing\"baseline\" gamma activity differences between groups (i.e.,meditation experts and naives), as previously suggested [6].Gamma activity has been shown to be influenced by severalfactors, including age [73], sex [74], and cognitive abilities [75].However, these factors are unlikely to have contributed to thepresent findings, given that LTM and meditation naive subjectswere matched for age, sex, and did not differ in education level.Future studies should investigate whether the group difference inNREM gamma activity in meditators is associated to a specificmeditation practice (e.g. mindfulness meditation vs. compassionmeditation) or style of meditation training (e.g. Tibetan Buddhismvs. Theravada Buddhism). Specifically, investigating the acuteeffect of an intense meditation session in LTM on sleep EEGpatterns could help in establishing a causal relationship betweenmeditation training and specific changes in EEG activity. Finally,future experiments combining fMRI with simultaneous hdEEGwill be critical to fully characterize the cortical (and possibly sub-cortical) networks underlying the enhanced NREM sleep EEGgamma activity found in this study in meditation experts, whereasstudies investigating the healing effects of meditation interventionscould explore the ability of EEG gamma power to predict abeneficial effect of such interventions. This work would contribute\\nto identify the neural circuits underlying the EEG correlates of\\nmeditation training. It will also help to establish whether EEGgamma activity represents a sensitive and objective measure of theeffects of meditative practice on brain function in both healthysubjects and brain disordered patients.\\nSupporting Information\\nFigure S1 REM tonic as well as phasic gamma power\\ndid not differ between LTM and meditation naives.Topographic color plots showed maximal REM tonic as well asphasic gamma power in frontal/prefrontal regions in both groups.Compared to meditation naives, LTM had a slightly higher powerin the same parieto-occipital region significantly more activeduring NREM sleep, which however failed to reach significance inboth tonic and phasic REM (white topographic plots, p = 0.975,and p = 0.810, SnPM).

Little is knownabout this process and its impact on the brain. Here we ﬁnd thatlong-term Buddhist practitioners self-induce sustained electroen-cephalographic high-amplitude gamma-band oscillations andphase-synchrony during meditation. These electroencephalogrampatterns differ from those of controls, in particular over lateralfrontoparietal electrodes. In addition, the ratio of gamma-bandactivity (25–42 Hz) to slow oscillatory activity (4–13 Hz) is initiallyhigher in the resting baseline before meditation for the practitio-ners than the controls over medial frontoparietal electrodes. Thisdifference increases sharply during meditation over most of thescalp electrodes and remains higher than the initial baseline in thepostmeditation baseline. These data suggest that mental traininginvolves temporal integrative mechanisms and may induce short-term and long-term neural changes.\\nelectroencephalogram synchrony /H20841gamma activity /H20841meditation\\nLittle is known about the process of meditation and its impact on\\nthe brain (1, 2). Previous studies show the general role of neural\\nsynchrony, in particular in the gamma-band frequencies (25–70Hz),in mental processes such as attention, working-memory, learning,or conscious perception (3–7). Such synchronizations of oscillatoryneural discharges are thought to play a crucial role in the consti-tution of transient networks that integrate distributed neural pro-cesses into highly ordered cognitive and affective functions (8, 9)and could induce synaptic changes (10, 11). Neural synchrony thusappears as a promising mechanism for the study of brain processesunderlining mental training.\\nMethods\\nThe subjects were eight long-term Buddhist practitioners (mean\\nage, 49 /H1100615 years) and 10 healthy student volunteers (mean age,\\n21/H110061.5 years). Buddhist practitioners underwent mental train-\\ning in the same Tibetan Nyingmapa and Kagyupa traditions for10,000 to 50,000 h over time periods ranging from 15 to 40 years.The length of their training was estimated based on their dailypractice and the time they spent in meditative retreats. Eighthours of sitting meditation was counted per day of retreat.Control subjects had no previous meditative experience but haddeclared an interest in meditation. Controls underwent medita-tive training for 1 week before the collection of the data.\\nWe first collected an initial electroencephalogram (EEG)\\nbaseline consisting of four 60-s blocks of ongoing activity with abalanced random ordering of eyes open or closed for each block.Then, subjects generated three meditative states, only one ofwhich will be described in this report. During each meditativesession, a 30-s block of resting activity and a 60-s block ofmeditation were collected four times sequentially. The subjectswere verbally instructed to begin the meditation and meditatedat least 20 s before the start of the meditation block. We focushere on the last objectless meditative practice during which boththe controls and Buddhist practitioners generated a state of‘‘unconditional loving-kindness and compassion.’’Meditative Instruction. The state of unconditional loving-kindness\\nand compassion is described as an ‘‘unrestricted readiness andavailability to help living beings.’’ This practice does not requireconcentration on particular objects, memories, or images, al-though in other meditations that are also part of their long-termtraining, practitioners focus on particular persons or groups ofbeings. Because ‘‘benevolence and compassion pervades the\\nmind as a way of being,’’ this state is called ‘‘pure compassion’’or ‘‘nonreferential compassion’’ ( dmigs med snying rje in Ti-\\nbetan). A week before the collection of the data, meditativeinstructions were given to the control subjects, who were askedto practice daily for 1 h. The quality of their training was verballyassessed before EEG collection. During the training session, thecontrol subjects were asked to think of someone they care about,such as their parents or beloved, and to let their mind be invadedby a feeling of love or compassion (by imagining a sad situationand wishing freedom from suffering and well being for thoseinvolved) toward these persons. After some training, the subjectswere asked to generate such feeling toward all sentient beingswithout thinking specifically about anyone in particular. Duringthe EEG data collection period, both controls and long-termpractitioners tried to generate this nonreferential state of loving-kindness and compassion. During the neutral states, all of thesubjects were asked to be in a nonmeditative, relaxed state.\\nEEG Recordings and Protocol. EEG data were recorded at standard\\nextended 10 /H2086220 positions with a 128-channel Geodesic Sensor\\nNet (Electrical Geodesics, Eugene, OR), sampled at 500 Hz, andreferenced to the vertex (Cz) with analog band-pass filteringbetween 0.1 and 200 Hz. EEG signals showing eye movementsor muscular artifacts were manually excluded from the study. Adigital notch filter was applied to the data at 60 Hz to remove anyartifacts caused by alternating current line noise.\\nBad channels were replaced by using spherical spline inter-\\npolation (12). Two-second epochs without artifact were ex-tracted after the digital rereferencing to the average reference.\\nSpectral Analysis. For each electrode and for each 2-s epoch, the\\npower spectral distribution was computed by using Welch’smethod (13), which averages power values across sliding andoverlapping 512-ms time windows. To compute the relativegamma activity, the power spectral distribution was computed onthez-transformed EEG by using the mean and SD of the signal\\nin each 2-s window. This distribution was averaged through allelectrodes, and the ratio between gamma and slow rhythms wascomputed. Intraindividual analyses were run on this measureand a group analysis was run on the average ratio across 2-swindows. The group analysis of the topography was performedby averaging the power spectral distribution for each electrode\\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\\nAbbreviations: ROI, region of interest; EEG, electroencephalogram.\\n†To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Here we assume thatthe spectral emission between 80 and 120 Hz provided anadequate measure of the muscle activity (14, 15). The muscleEEG signature is characterized by a broad-band spectrum profile(8–150 Hz) peaking at 70–80 Hz (16). Thus, the variationthrough time of the average spectral power in the 80–120 Hzfrequency band provided a way to quantify the variations of themuscle contribution to the EEG gamma activity through time.To estimate the gamma activity, adjusted for the very highfrequencies, we performed a covariance analysis for each regionof interest (ROI) for each subject. The dependent variable wasthe average gamma activity (25–42 Hz) in each ROI. Thecontinuous predictor was the electromyogram activity (80–120Hz power). The categorical predictors were the blocks (initialbaseline with eyes open and neutral blocks from 2 to 4) and themental states (ongoing neutral versus meditation).\\nFor the group analysis, separate repeated ANOVAs were then\\nperformed on the relative gamma and adjusted gamma variationbetween states, with the blocks as the within factor and the group(practitioners versus controls) as the categorical predictor. Forthe intrasubject analysis, we compared separately the relativegamma and the raw gamma activity averaged within the ROIs inthe initial baseline state versus the meditative state.\\nPhase-Synchrony Detection. Electrodes of interest were referenced\\nto a local average potential defined as the average potential ofits six surrounding neighbors. This referencing montage re-stricted the electrical measurement to local sources only andprevented spurious long-range synchrony from being detected ifthe muscle activity over one electrode propagated to anotherdistant electrode. The methods used to measure long-rangesynchronization are described in detail in Supporting Methods ,\\nwhich is published as supporting information on the PNAS website. In summary, for each epoch and electrode, the instanta-neous phase of the signal was extracted at each frequency bandbetween 25 and 42 Hz in 2-Hz steps by using a convolution withMorlet wavelets. The stability through time of their phasedifference was quantified in comparison with white-noise signalsas independent surrogates. A measure of synchronous activitywas defined as the number of electrode pairs among the 294studied combinations that had higher synchrony density onaverage across frequencies than would be expected to occurbetween independent signals. The electrode pairs were takenbetween the ROIs when we measured the scalp distribution ofgamma activity (see Fig. 3 a). A repeated-measures ANOVA was\\nperformed on the average size of the synchrony pattern acrossall frequency bands and epochs in each block with the originalresting state and the meditative state as the within factors andthe group (practitioners versus controls) as the between-groupsfactor.\\nResults\\nWe first computed the power spectrum density over each\\nelectrode in the EEG signals visually free from artifacts. Thisprocedure was adapted to detect change in local synchroniza-tion (6, 9). Local synchronization occurs when neurons re-corded by a single electrode transiently oscillate at the samefrequency with a common phase: Their local electric field addsup to produce a burst of oscillatory power in the signalreaching the electrode. Thus, the power spectral densityprovides an estimation of the average of these peaks of energyin a time window. During meditation, we found high-amplitudegamma oscillations in the EEGs of long-time practitioners(subjects S1–S8) that were not present in the initial baseline.Fig. 1 aprovides a representative example of the raw EEG\\nsignal (25–42 Hz) for subject S4. An essential aspect of thesegamma oscillations is that their amplitude monotonicallyincreased over the time of the practice (Fig. 1 b).\\nRelative Gamma Power. We characterized these changes in gamma\\noscillations in relation to the slow rhythms (4–13 Hz) that arethought to play a complementary function to fast rhythms (3).Fig. 2 ashows the intraindividual analysis of this ratio averaged\\nthrough all electrodes. This ratio, which was averaged across allelectrodes, presented an increase compared with the initialbaseline, which was greater than twice the baseline SD for twocontrols and all of the practitioners. The ratio of gamma-bandactivity (25–42 Hz) compared to slow rhythms was initially\\nhigher in the baseline before meditation for the practitionerscompared with the controls ( t/H110054.0, df/H1100516,P/H110210.001; ttest)\\n(Fig. 2 b). This effect remained when we compared the three\\nyoungest practitioners with the controls (25, 34, and 36 years old,respectively) ( t/H110052.2, df /H1100511,P/H110210.05; ttest). This result\\nsuggests that the mean age difference between groups does notfully account for this baseline difference (17).\\nThis baseline difference increased sharply during meditation,\\nas revealed by an interaction between the state and group factors[F(2, 48)/H110053.7,P/H110210.05; ANOVA] (Fig. 2 b). This difference was\\nstill found in comparisons between gamma activity and boththeta (4–8 Hz) and alpha activity. To localize these differenceson the scalp, similar analyses were performed on each individualelectrode. Fig. 2 cshows a higher ratio of fast versus slow\\nFig. 1.

Similarly, Fig. 2 dshows a group\\ndifference between the ongoing baseline states and the medita-tive state, in particular over the frontolateral and posteriorelectrodes. Interestingly, the postmeditative baseline (neutralstates in blocks 2, 3, and 4) also revealed a significant increasein this ratio compared with the premeditation baseline overmainly anterior electrodes (Fig. 2 e).\\nThese data suggest that the two groups had different electro-\\nphysiological spectral profiles in the baseline, which are charac-\\nterized by a higher ratio of gamma-band oscillatory rhythm toslow oscillatory rhythms for the long-term practitioners than forthe controls. This group difference is enhanced during themeditative practice and continues into the postmeditative restingblocks.\\nAbsolute Gamma Power. We then studied the variation through\\ntime of the ongoing gamma-band activity itself. The gamma-band activity (25–42 Hz) was first z-transformed in each block\\nand compared over each electrode with the mean and SD of theirrespective neutral block (ongoing baseline). The normalizedgamma activity was then averaged across the blocks. Fig. 3 a\\nshows the percentage of subjects presenting an increase of atleast 1 SD during meditation compared with neutral state. Acommon topographical pattern of gamma activity emergedacross the long-term practitioners but not across the controlsubjects. This pattern was located bilaterally over the parieto-temporal and midfrontal electrodes.

Hereafter, we focus on theelectrodes activated in these ROIs.\\nIntraindividual analyses similar to those for relative gamma\\nactivity were run on the average gamma power across these ROIsand exhibited the same pattern as that found for relative gamma.It is possible that these high-amplitude oscillations are partiallycontaminated by muscle activity (18). Because we found in-creases in gamma activity during the postmeditative restingbaseline compared with the initial resting baseline, it is unlikelythat the changes we reported could be solely caused by muscle\\nactivity, because there was little evidence of any muscle activityduring these baseline periods. (Fig. 2 e). Secondly, we showed\\nthat the meditative state and nonmeditative state that mimickedand exaggerated the possible muscle activity during meditationexhibit significantly different spectral profiles (Fig. 4, which ispublished as supporting information on the PNAS web site).Furthermore, for the two subjects showing the highest gammaactivity, we showed that amplitude of the gamma-band activitybefore external stimulation predicts the amplitude of high fast-\\nFig. 2.

            "page_content='frequency oscillations (20–45 Hz) evoked by auditory stimuli\\n(Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on thePNAS web site). Because the evoked activity is relatively inde-pendent of muscle activity, the relationship between the pre-stimulation fast-frequency oscillation and the evoked activitysuggests that these high-amplitude gamma rhythms are notmuscle artifacts (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, which is published assupporting information on the PNAS web site). This claim isfurther supported by the localization within the brain of thedipole sources of these fast-frequency-evoked oscillations (Figs.7–9, which are published as supporting information on the PNASweb site).\\nYet we still chose to cautiously interpret the raw values of\\nthese gamma oscillations because of the concomitant increase ofspectral power /H1102280 Hz during meditation. This increase could\\nalso reflect a change in muscle activity rather than high-frequency, gamma-band oscillations [70–105 Hz (19)], which aremostly low-pass filtered by the skull at /H1102280 Hz. Thus, we chose\\nto conservatively interpret the activity at /H1102280 Hz as indicating\\nmuscle activity.\\nTo remove the contribution of putative muscle activity, we\\nquantified the increase in the average amplitude of gammaoscillation (25–42 Hz) adjusted for the effect of the veryhigh-frequency variation (80–120 Hz) (see Methods and ref. 20).\\nThe adjusted average variation in gamma activity was /H1102230-fold\\ngreater among practitioners compared with controls (Fig. 3 b).\\nGroup analysis was run on the average adjusted gamma activityover these ROIs. Gamma activity increased for both the long-term practitioners and controls from neutral to meditation states[F(1, 16)/H110055.2,P/H110210.05; ANOVA], yet this increase was higher\\nfor the long-time practitioners than for the controls [ F(1, 16)/H11005\\n4.6,P/H110210.05; interaction between the state and group factors\\nANOVA] (Fig. 3 b). In summary, the generation of this medi-\\ntative state was associated with gamma oscillations that weresignificantly higher in amplitude for the group of practitionersthan for the group of control subjects.\\nLong-Distance Gamma Synchrony. Finally, a long-distance syn-\\nchrony analysis was conducted between electrodes from theROIs found in Fig. 3 a. Long-distance synchrony is thought to\\nreflect large-scale neural coordination (9) and can occur whentwo neural populations recorded by two distant electrodesoscillate with a precise phase relationship that remains constantduring a certain number of oscillation cycles. This approach isillustrated in Fig. 1 cfor selected electrodes (F3 /H208624, Fc5 /H208626, and\\nCp5 /H208626). For subject S4, the density of cross-hemisphere, long-\\ndistance synchrony increases by /H1101530% on average during med-\\nitation and follows a pattern similar to the oscillatory gammaactivity.\\nFor all subjects, locally referenced, long-distance synchronies\\nwere computed for each 2-s epoch during the neutral andmeditative states between all electrode pairs and across eightfrequencies ranging from 25 to 42 Hz. In each meditative orneutral block, we counted the number of electrode pairs (294electrode pairs maximum) that had an average density ofsynchrony higher than those derived from noise surrogates (seeMethods ). We ran a group analysis on the size of the synchronous\\npattern and found that its size was greater for long-time prac-titioners than for controls [ F(1, 16)/H1100510.3, P/H110210.01; ANOVA]\\nand increased from neutral to meditation states [ F(1, 16)/H110058.2,\\nP/H110210.02; ANOVA]. Fig. 3 cshows that the group and state\\nfactors interacted on long-distance synchrony [ F(1, 16) /H110056.5,\\nP/H110210.05; ANOVA]: The size of synchrony patterns increased\\nmore for the long-time practitioners than for the controls fromneutral to meditation states. These data suggest that large-scalebrain coordination increases during mental practice.\\nFinally, we investigated whether there was a correlation\\nbetween the hours of formal sitting meditation (for subjectsS1–S8, 9,855–52,925 h) and these electrophysiological measures\\nfor the long-term practitioners, in either the initial or meditativestates (same values as in Figs. 2 and 3). The correlation coeffi-cients for the relative, absolute, and phase-synchrony gammameasures were positive: r/H110050.79, 0.63, and 0.64, respectively, in\\nthe initial state, and r/H110050.66, 0.62, and 0.43, respectively, in the\\nmeditative state. A significant positive correlation was foundonly in the initial baseline for the relative gamma ( r/H110050.79, P/H11021\\n0.02) (Fig. 3 d). These data suggest that the degree of training can\\ninfluence the spectral distribution of the ongoing baseline EEG.The age of the subject was not a confounding factor in this effectas suggested by the low correlation between the practitioner ageand the relative gamma ( r/H110050.23).\\nDiscussion\\nWe found robust gamma-band oscillation and long-distance\\nphase-synchrony during the generation of the nonreferentialcompassion meditative state. It is likely based on descriptions ofvarious meditation practices and mental strategies that arereported by practitioners that there will be differences in brainfunction associated with different types of meditation. In light ofour initial observations concerning robust gamma oscillationsduring this compassion meditation state, we focused our initialattention on this state. Future research is required to charac-terize the nature of the differences among types of meditation.Our resulting data differ from several studies that found anincrease in slow alpha or theta rhythms during meditation (21).The comparison is limited by the fact that these studies typicallydid not analyze fast rhythms. More importantly, these studiesmainly investigated different forms of voluntary concentrativemeditation on an object (such as a meditation on a mantra or thebreath). These concentration techniques can be seen as aparticular form of top-down control that may exhibit an impor-tant slow oscillatory component (22). First-person descriptionsof objectless meditations, however, differ radically from those ofconcentration meditation. Objectless meditation does not di-rectly attend to a specific object but rather cultivates a state ofbeing. Objectless meditation does so in such a way that, accord-ing to reports given after meditation, the intentional or object-oriented aspect of experience appears to dissipate in meditation.This dissipation of focus on a particular object is achieved byletting the very essence of the meditation that is practiced (oncompassion in this case) become the sole content of the expe-rience, without focusing on particular objects. By using similartechniques during the practice, the practitioner lets his feeling ofloving-kindness and compassion permeate his mind withoutdirecting his attention toward a particular object. These phe-nomenological differences suggest that these various meditativestates (those that involve focus on an object and those that areobjectless) may be associated with different EEG oscillatorysignatures.\\nThe high-amplitude gamma activity found in some of these\\npractitioners are, to our knowledge, the highest reported in theliterature in a nonpathological context (23). Assuming thatthe amplitude of the gamma oscillation is related to the size ofthe oscillating neural population and the degree of precision withwhich cells oscillate, these data suggest that massive distributedneural assemblies are synchronized with a high temporal preci-sion in the fast frequencies during this state. The gradualincrease of gamma activity during meditation is in agreementwith the view that neural synchronization, as a network phe-nomenon, requires time to develop (24), proportional to the sizeof the synchronized neural assembly (25). But this increase couldalso reflect an increase in the temporal precision of the thalamo-cortical and corticocortical interactions rather than a change inthe size of the assemblies (8). This gradual increase also cor-roborates the Buddhist subjects’ verbal report of the chronom-etry of their practice. Typically, the transition from the neutral\\n16372 /H20841www.pnas.org /H20862cgi/H20862doi /H2086210.1073 /H20862pnas.0407401101 Lutz et al.' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/lutz 2004.pdf', 'page': 3}\n",
            "page_content='state to this meditative state is not immediate and requires 5–15\\ns, depending on the subject. The endogenous gamma-bandsynchrony found here could reflect a change in the quality ofmoment-to-moment awareness, as claimed by the Buddhistpractitioners and as postulated by many models of consciousness(26, 27).\\nIn addition to the meditation-induced effects, we found a\\ndifference in the normative EEG spectral profile between thetwo populations during the resting state before meditation. It isnot unexpected that such differences would be detected duringa resting baseline, because the goal of meditation practice is totransform the baseline state and to diminish the distinctionbetween formal meditation practice and everyday life. More-over, Gusnard and Raichle (28) have highlighted the importanceof characteristic patterns of brain activity during the resting stateand argue that such patterns affect the nature of task-inducedchanges. The differences in baseline activity reported heresuggest that the resting state of the brain may be altered bylong-term meditative practice and imply that such alterationsmay affect task-related changes. Our practitioners and controlsubjects differed in many respects, including age, culture oforigin, and first language, and they likely differed in many morerespects, including diet and sleep. We examined whether age wasan important factor in producing the baseline differences weobserved by comparing the three youngest practitioners with thecontrols and found that the mean age difference between groupsis unlikely the sole factor responsible for this baseline difference.Moreover, hours of practice but not age significantly predictedrelative gamma activity during the initial baseline period.\\nWhether other demographic factors are important in producingthese effects will necessarily require further research, particu-larly longitudinal research that follows individuals over time inresponse to mental training.\\nOur study is consistent with the idea that attention and\\naffective processes, which gamma-band EEG synchronizationmay reflect, are flexible skills that can be trained (29). It remainsfor future studies to show that these EEG signatures are causedby long-term training itself and not by individual differencesbefore the training, although the positive correlation that wefound with hours of training and other randomized controlledtrials suggest that these are training-related effects (2). Thefunctional consequences of sustained gamma-activity duringmental practice are not currently known but need to be studiedin the future. The study of experts in mental training may offera promising research strategy to investigate high-order cognitiveand affective processes (30).\\nWe thank J. Dunne for Tibetan translation; A.

Introduction\\nIn recent years there has been a growing scientiﬁc interest in the\\nneurophysiological bases of meditation ( Barinaga, 2003; Knight,\\n2004 ), reﬂecting the exploding interest in neuroplasticity, namelyexperience-induced changes in the brain ( Lutz et al., 2007 ). Medita-\\ntion is a body-and-mind self-regulating practice that focuses on\\ntraining attention in order to bring mental processes under greater\\nvoluntary control. Accumulating evidence shows meditation-re-\\nlated changes either as state (short-term) or trait (longer-term,\\nresting state changes) (reviewed by Cahn and Polich, 2006 ). Medi-\\ntation was shown to induce neuroplasticity in brain function(Davidson and Lutz, 2008 ) as well as structure ( Hölzel et al., 2011 ).\\nOne form of meditation which has been largely related to well-\\nbeing is mindfulness meditation (MM) (reviewed by Rubia, 2009 ).\\nMM aims at cultivating a non-judgmental awareness of the\\n1388-2457/$36.00 /C2112011 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

MM, among other Buddhist practices, could be\\nexpected to affect self-referential processing, as the major aim of\\npractice is the realization, by direct experience, of the lack of any\\nessential ‘self’ ( Dreyfus and Thompson, 2007 ).\\nSelf-referential processing has been attributed to a set of re-\\ngions which were designated the ‘Default Mode Network’ (DMN).\\nThe DMN, which involves the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),\\nthe medial temporal lobe (including the hippocampus and para-\\nhippocampal gyrus), posterior lateral cortices, anterior and poster-\\nior cingulated cortex (ACC, PCC) and precuneus, was shown to be\\nactive when individuals are engaged in internal processing, and\\nto deactivate when attention shifts towards external stimuli\\n(Raichle et al., 2001 ).\\nAccumulating evidence of several recent functional magnetic\\nresonance imaging (fMRI) studies supports the idea that various\\ntypes of meditation training alter DMN activity. Farb et al. (2007)\\nshowed that in MM trained participants, meditation resulted in a\\nreduction in the mPFC activity, and increased engagement of a\\nright lateralized network, comprising the lateral PFC and visceroso-\\nmatic areas such as the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex\\nand inferior parietal lobule. They also reported lower functional\\nconnectivity in practitioners compared to controls of the habitual\\ncoupling between the mPFC regions, supporting cognitive–affec-\\ntive representations of the self, and more posterior lateral viscero-\\nsomatic areas, representing neural images of body state. Pagnoni\\net al. (2008) tested Zen practitioners using fMRI during meditation\\ninterspersed with a lexical decision task. The neural correlates of\\nconceptual processing were identiﬁed in left regions of the DMN.\\nWhile there were no behavioral performance differences between\\nthe practitioners and the controls, the practitioners displayed a re-\\nduced duration of the neural response linked to conceptual pro-\\ncessing in left regions of the DMN, suggesting voluntary\\nregulation of the ﬂow of spontaneous mentation.\\nThese neuroimaging studies demonstrate that meditative prac-\\ntices can generally decrease activity and lower habitual connectiv-\\nity patterns within regions of the DMN during meditation. Other\\nfMRI studies showed, on the contrary, meditation-induced in-\\ncreased activity within the DMN. Hölzel et al. (2007) reported in-\\ncreased activity within the mPFC and ACC in MM practitioners\\ncompared to controls while comparing meditation to a mental\\narithmetic task. Jang et al. (2011) reported resting state greater\\nfunctional connectivity within the DMN in the mPFC area in\\nbrain-wave vibration meditation practitioners, a method based\\non focusing attention on bodily sensations and emotions, com-\\npared to controls. In addition, in a single-photon emission com-\\nputed tomography (SPECT) study, after only ﬁve days of\\nintegrative body–mind training (IBMT, combined Chinese tradi-tional meditation and MM training) compared to a relaxation\\ntraining group, there was a resting state activation increase in\\nthe ACC and PCC, two nodes of the DMN ( Tang et al., 2009 ). Finally,\\nanother recent fMRI study ( Kilpatrick et al., 2011 ) reported that\\n8 weeks of MM training induced changes in functional connectivity\\nbetween self-reference networks and sensory (auditory and visual)\\nawareness networks.\\nTaken together, neuroimaging studies support the idea of med-\\nitation-induced DMN plasticity, although the exact changes are\\ninconclusive, probably due to the engagement of various types of\\nmeditation and different study designs.\\nSeveral studies investigated the relationship between the DMN\\nas measured by fMRI and neuronal oscillatory processes in differ-\\nent electroencephalographic (EEG) frequency bands (summarized\\nbyBroyd et al., 2009 ). Gamma power (25–45 Hz) increase has been\\nrelated to activity in the prefrontal node of the DMN ( Chen et al.,\\n2008; Mantini et al., 2007 ), which is closely related to self-referen-\\ntial processing ( Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004; Northoff et al.,2006 ). The activity in the rest of the DMN, excluding the prefrontal\\nnode, was related to global alpha and beta power increase (8–13\\nand 13–25 Hz, respectively) ( Chen et al., 2008; Laufs et al., 2003;\\nMantini et al., 2007 ). Finally, the DMN activity was generally neg-\\natively correlated with frontal and midline theta power (4–8 Hz)\\n(Meltzer et al., 2007; Scheeringa et al., 2008 ), as was the activity\\nin anterior medial cortex ( Mizuhara et al., 2004 ). To sum, activity\\nin the prefrontal node of the DMN, largely related to self-reference,\\nis manifested mostly in the gamma band.\\nGamma oscillations are typically related to top-down atten-\\ntive processes ( Herrmann et al., 2010 ), enhanced arousal and fo-\\ncused attention (e.g. Engel et al., 2001 ) and to conscious\\nawareness (e.g. Lutz et al., 2002 ). While meditation was fre-\\nquently shown to increase activity in the theta and alpha\\nrhythms (reviewed by Cahn and Polich, 2006; Ivanovski and\\nMalhi, 2007; Rubia, 2009 ), reports on gamma-band changes\\nrelated to meditation practice are sparser, albeit starting to accu-\\nmulate. Increased gamma power was recorded over fronto-pari-\\netal sites in highly experienced meditators compared with a\\ncontrol group, during compassion meditation as well as during\\nresting state, and this was found to be in positive correlation\\nwith the degree of training ( Lutz et al., 2004 ). Another study re-\\nported increased gamma power over parieto-occipital sites dur-\\ning MM compared to resting state in expert practitioners. This\\neffect was enhanced with practice proﬁciency ( Cahn et al., 2010 ).\\nLehmann et al. (2001) evaluated one highly experienced med-\\nitator using low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography\\n(LORETA) while practicing different forms of meditation. Each\\nmeditation type yielded different LORETA functional images of\\nthe EEG gamma band: image visualization increased gamma\\npower in the right posterior occipital area, and mantra verbaliza-\\ntion increased gamma power in the left central–temporal region,\\nboth being consistent with known functional anatomy. Interest-\\ningly, during self-dissolution (the meditator concentrated on the\\nexperience of dissolution of the self into a boundless unity, or\\nemptiness) and self-reconstitution meditation (the meditator\\nconcentrated on experiencing the reconstitution of the self) gam-\\nma activity increased in right superior frontal and right tempo-\\nral-parietal sites, brain regions which have been linked to an\\naltered sense of self ( Mathew et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2001 )\\nand body schema functions ( Cassady et al., 1998 ), respectively.\\nAnother study reported a lack of frontal gamma power in re-\\nsponse to emotionally aversive movie clips in long-term Sahaja\\nYoga meditators compared to controls ( Aftanas and Golosheykin,\\n2005 ). Finally, Travis et al. (2010) tested Transcendental Medita-\\ntion (TM) practitioners before and after a 10-week training, and\\nreported a reduction in gamma power over frontal and parietal\\nsites during TM compared to rest. Taken together, there is accu-mulating evidence for meditative training-induced changes in\\nthe gamma rhythm.\\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that MM training would\\nresult in changes in DMN activity, in a measurable manner within\\nthe gamma band EEG, and in a gradual manner with MM proﬁ-\\nciency. Speciﬁcally, we attempted to answer the following three\\nquestions:\\n(1) Can the reduction in DMN activity associated with the tran-\\nsition from resting state to an attentional task be identiﬁed\\nin the gamma band?\\n(2) Could the expected changes in DMN activity associated with\\nmeditation practice be identiﬁed in the gamma band as a\\ntrait- or as a state-effect?\\n(3) Are any of these changes related to practice proﬁciency?\\nAs will be shown, we answer the three questions by: (1) identi-\\nfying DMN deactivation during the transition from resting state toA.

Furthermore, we found\\nstate, and to a lesser extent trait increases in posterior gamma\\npower, mostly right lateralized, attributed to increased attentional\\nskills and heightened sensory awareness. This effect was again\\nunrelated to practice proﬁciency.\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Participants\\nParticipants comprised 36 Mindfulness Meditation (MM) prac-\\ntitioners and 12 healthy controls who had no prior meditation\\nexperience, but who declared an interest in meditation in a preced-\\ning written interview (interest > 5 on a 0–10 scale). The MM prac-\\ntitioners were recruited via word of mouth in local MM\\norganizations. They were divided into three groups ( n= 12 each)\\nwith varying degree of expertise, on the basis of accumulated\\nhours spent in formal meditation during retreats and daily practice\\n(M ± SD, min.–max.): Short-term (ST, 894 ± 450 h, 180–1430 h),\\nIntermediate-term (IT, 2570 ± 471 h, 1740–2860 h), and Long-term\\npractitioners (LT, 7556 ± 5027 h, 3870–23,000 h). The MM groups\\n(mean ages, 41.6 ± 13.3, 37.9 ± 10.4, 45.6 ± 10.6, respectively) were\\nage-matched with a control group (mean age, 41 ± 12.5). All partic-\\nipants were right handed and healthy, and were tested at least 3 h\\nafter their last meditation session, to control for immediate effects\\nand enable studying long-term, trait effects of practice. The re-\\nsearch was approved by the institutional ethical committee, and\\ninformed consent was obtained from each participant.\\n2.2. Design and procedure\\nThe study was conducted using a pre-post design. Spontaneous\\nEEG during resting state was recorded for 5 min (2.5 min eyes open\\nand then 2.5 min eyes closed) prior to a battery of tasks designed to\\nmeasure temporal and spatial perception, as well as attentional\\nskills. The only task which will be reported here is a time-produc-\\ntion task, used to compare resting state with a closed eyes task en-\\nabling continuous EEG recording. EEG was then recorded during a\\nmeditation session of 15 min, while the control participants were\\ngiven the instruction to ‘‘relax as best as you can without falling\\nasleep’’. Then, resting state EEG was acquired again as above\\n(5 min), and the task battery was administered once more. Only\\nthree eyes-closed conditions will be reported here: the initial rest-\\ning state (RS), the time production task (TP) and the meditation\\n(MED).\\n2.3. Time production (TP) task\\n2.3.1. TP procedure\\nFor an approximate length of 2–3 min, the participants were re-\\nquested by recorded instructions to produce speciﬁed target dura-\\ntions by pressing a ﬁnger button when they estimated that the\\ntime which passed from the ‘beep’ sound equaled the speciﬁed re-\\nquested duration. Four time intervals were used: 4, 8, 16 and 32 s,\\neach interval twice, with random order of presentation ( Glicksohn\\net al., 2009 ). Before the task, a practice of two time intervals (4 and\\n8 s) was given. The task was performed with closed eyes to reduce\\nocular artifacts in the EEG, and to facilitate the comparison with RS.\\nThe participants were not supervised concerning the time estima-tion strategy during the task itself (internal counting, or other), and\\nwere questioned afterwards concerning the employed strategy.\\n2.3.2. TP analysis\\nProduced ( P) durations were log-transformed (to base 2), with\\nrequired durations rendering thereby a linear scale ranging be-\\ntween 2 and 5, with a midpoint value of 3.5. A one-way analysis\\nof variance (ANOVA) was performed on mean log( P) to investigate\\ngroup differences.\\n2.4. EEG recording and protocol\\nEEG was recorded with a 65-channel geodesic sensor net (Elec-\\ntrical Geodesics, Eugene, OR), sampled at 500 Hz and referenced to\\nthe vertex (Cz), with analog 0.1–200 Hz band-pass ﬁltering, and a\\ndigital notch ﬁlter at 50 Hz to remove artifacts caused by alternat-\\ning current line noise. Impedance was usually kept under 40 k O,\\nwell below the 200 k Olimit for accurate signal acquisition with\\nthis system ( Ferree et al., 2001 ). The data were referenced ofﬂine\\nto average reference, and then screened for blinks, horizontal–ver-\\ntical eye movements, muscle artifacts and possible sleepiness by\\nvisual inspection. When any of these artifacts affected electrodesin a widespread distribution, the data did not enter the analysis.\\nIn some of the artifact-free epochs chosen for further analysis, sev-\\neral channels exhibited noisy recording due to local high imped-\\nance (>40 k O, mean of 3 electrodes per epoch, in /C2410% of the\\nepochs), in which case the corrected values were off-line calculated\\nby using spherical spline interpolation ( Perrin et al., 1989\\n).\\nFor each condition, the ﬁrst 16 non-overlapping, artifact-free\\nepochs of 1024 sample points (2.048 s duration) were extracted\\nfor further analysis. For the meditation, epochs were extracted\\nfrom the middle (between 5–10 min from the start of meditation)\\nto enable ‘settling’ in the condition.\\nThe power (measured in lV2) spectral distribution was calcu-\\nlated by ﬁrst multitapering the raw data (using a Matlab-based\\nsoftware package – http://chronux.org/ ), in order to minimize\\npower leakage ( Bronez, 1992; Thomson, 1982; van Vugt et al.,\\n2007 ), then transforming it from the temporal domain to the fre-\\nquency domain using fast-Fourier transform (0.5 Hz resolution,\\n1024 point block-size, Hanning window, 0.5–46 Hz). For each elec-\\ntrode, the absolute spectral power was grouped into frequency\\nbands: delta (0.1–3.5 Hz), theta (3.5–7.5 Hz), alpha (7.5–13 Hz),\\nbeta (13–25 Hz) and gamma (25–45 Hz), then log transformed\\nand averaged across the 16 epochs. Electrodes were collapsed into\\nnine Regions of Interest (ROIs, see Fig. 1 ) – left and right frontal (F),\\ncentral (C), temporal (T), parietal–occipital (PO) and midline\\nFig. 1.

            "page_content='(M) – and the mean log spectral power was calculated for each ROI\\nseparately.\\n2.5. Gamma band reliability\\nA possible confounding effect for cortically induced gamma\\npower is electromyographic (EMG) activity from scalp and neck\\nmuscles ( Whitham et al., 2007 ), or saccade-related spike potentials\\n(SP) due to eye movements ( Yuval-Greenberg and Deouell, 2009 ).\\nIn this study, we used three steps for caution: ﬁrst, we carefully\\nvisually inspected the raw data, manually extracting artifact-free\\nepochs. Second, as the EMG peaks at 70–80Hz ( Cacioppo et al.,\\n1990 ), we used much lower frequencies, in the 25–45 Hz. And\\nthird, we excluded from statistical analyses all the circumference\\nelectrodes, closest to eyes, neck and face muscles (see Fig. 1 ).\\nIn addition to these three cautious steps, we also assessed the\\nreliability of the data using the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of log\\ngamma power, deﬁned as the standard-deviation/mean. The CV\\ncan be viewed as a measure of pattern stability, in which CV /C241\\nindicates a nearly random process and CV /C281 reﬂects very high\\nstability ( Fingelkurts et al., 2006 ). CV was computed for the elec-\\ntrodes included in this study for 8 odd epochs and 8 even epochs\\n(2.048 s each, total of /C2432 s). The analysis of CV revealed within-\\nsubject stability: the individual CVs were quite low ( M±SD) for\\nRS, TP and MED being 0.37 ± 0.45; 0.17 ± 0.37; 0.19 ± 0.55, respec-\\ntively, indicating that the electrophysiological measures of gamma\\npower indeed show high internal-consistency reliability. The mean\\nCV values of the odd and the even epochs showed signiﬁcant cor-\\nrelation across participants ( r= .47, p< .05, n= 48).\\nTo sum, we think that our results could be considered clean\\nfrom artifacts for two reasons: ﬁrst, our entire report deals with\\nclosed-eyes conditions, while the SP is elicited at the onset of small\\nsaccades which occur during eyes-open ﬁxation ( Martinez-Conde\\net al., 2004 ). Second, our data shows high within-subject consis-tency. All this suggests that our results represent cognitive pro-\\ncesses, rather than muscular artifacts.\\n2.6. Statistical analyses\\nWe focus in this report on the gamma band. Three analyses\\nof variance (ANOVAs) were performed on the log power gamma\\nvalues. The ﬁrst was designed to answer the ﬁrst question: Can\\nthe reduction in DMN activity associated with the transition\\nfrom resting state to an attentional task be identiﬁed in the\\ngamma band? This ANOVA had one Grouping factor (MM and\\nC), and repeated measures on two within-participant factors:\\nCondition (RS and TP), and ROI (left and right F, C, T, PO and\\nM), adopting the Greenhouse-Geisser p-value for each and every\\neffect. The same ANOVA also answered the ﬁrst part of the sec-\\nond question, concerning trait effects in DMN activity associated\\nwith meditation practice.\\nA second ANOVA, designed to answer the third question –\\nwhether the effects revealed by the ﬁrst ANOVA were related to\\npractice proﬁciency, had one Grouping factor (ST-MM, IT-MM\\nand LT-MM), and repeated measures on the two within-participant\\nfactors above: Condition (RS and TP) and ROI.\\nThe third ANOVA was conducted to test for any state differences\\nbetween resting state and meditation, testing also their relation to\\nexpertise level, and was thus designed to answer the second part of\\nthe second question, as well as the third question. This ANOVA was\\ndesigned like the previous, with one Grouping factor (ST-MM, IT-\\nMM and LT-MM), and with repeated measures on the two with-\\nin-participant factors above: Condition and ROI, but with different\\nconditions (RS and MED).\\nWhile statistically signiﬁcant results were reported for ROIs\\nonly, we added topographic distributions of pair-wise electrode\\nt-tests (Figs. 2,3and5). These ﬁgures are to be taken as illustrative\\nFig. 2.

Subjective reports\\nThe subjective reports from the meditators revealed that they\\nwere able to successfully perform meditation in the laboratory,\\nwith meditative depth (on a 1–10 scale, where 5 indicates ‘success\\nin the lab meditation as much as in one’s regular practice’) of\\n5.50 ± 2.64, 7.14 ± 1.77 and 6.92 ± 1.73 for the short-term (ST),\\nintermediate-term (IT) and long-term (LT) groups, respectively\\n[F(2, 35) = 1.05, MSE = 3.34, ns]. During the TP task, the percentages\\nof participants who reported mental counting were 100% for C, ST-\\nMM and IT-MM groups, and 83% for the LT-MM. The rest (17%) of\\nthe LT-MM reported ‘unverbal sensing’ the passage of time rather\\nthan counting.\\n3.2. Gamma power\\nThe ﬁrst ANOVA testing gamma-band changes in the transition\\nfrom RS to TP revealed a main effect for ROI [ F(8, 360) = 10.53,\\nMSE = .034, p< .0001] stemming from lower gamma power overC and M ROIs. More importantly for the issue of DMN deactivation\\nin the transition to an attentional task, we found a signiﬁcant\\nROI/C2Condition interaction [ F(8, 360) = 4.87, MSE = .012, p< .001]\\n(Fig. 2 ): While values were generally lowest during the RS com-\\npared to the TP condition for most ROIs, it was reversed for the F\\nand M ROIs. This effect indicates that DMN activity in the gamma\\nband could be seen over the bilateral F and M ROIs.\\nOf importance to the question of trait effects following MM prac-\\ntice, the ROI /C2Group interaction was signiﬁcant [ F(8, 360) = 2.75,\\nMSE = .034, p< .05]: whereas gamma power was generally larger\\nin the C compared to the MM group, especially over the right F, this\\nsituation was inverted over the right PO ( Fig. 3 ). The group’s mean\\nlog gamma power results are given in Table 1 (an example of individ-\\nual gamma power distributions is given in Fig. 4 ).\\nThe second ANOVA, designed to differentiate trait differences\\nbetween the three MM groups, revealed as before a signiﬁcant ROI /C2\\nCondition interaction [ F(8, 256) = 10.24, MSE =. 0 0 6 , p<. 0 0 0 1 ] ,\\nindicating a shift away from DMN activity ( Fig. 2 B). There were no\\ngroup related main effects or interactions.\\nFinally, the third ANOVA tested for state effects by comparing\\nMED to RS within the three MM groups. We found a main effect\\nfor Condition [ F(1,34) = 17.00, MSE = .054, p< .0001], with gamma\\npower being generally higher during MED compared to RS, and a\\nmain effect of ROI [ F(8,272) = 8.10, MSE = .039, p< .0001] stem-\\nming again from lower gamma power over C and M ROIs.

DMN activity within the gamma band\\nThe transition from resting state (RS), a condition shown to be\\nrelated to DMN activity and self-processing, to time production\\n(TP), which is a task engaging attention in temporal measurement\\nwith a trade-off in attention allocation to other cognitive modulesperforming nontemporal information processing ( Glicksohn,\\n2001 ), is accompanied by a decline over the frontal (F) and midline\\n(M) ROIs ( Fig. 2 ). Considering that: (i) a positive correlation be-\\ntween induced gamma oscillations, measured by changes in the\\nsignal power in response to sensory stimulation, and the blood\\noxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal has been established, both\\nin animals ( Logothetis et al., 2001 ) and in humans ( Foucher et al.,\\n2003 ); (ii) gamma power has been related to the frontal node of\\nthe DMN, the mPFC ( Mantini et al., 2007 ); and (iii) the DMN essen-\\ntially involves frontal and midline structures ( Buckner et al., 2008;\\nGusnard et al., 2001 ), it seems feasible to consider gamma power\\nover the frontal and midline ROIs as a marker of DMN activity.\\nHence, the expected decline in DMN activity in the transition to\\nthe TP task is indicated by the reduction in gamma power over\\nthe F and M ROIs. In support of this conclusion, Jerbi et al.

            "page_content='tested EEG state effects of MM practice was Cahn et al. (2010) , who\\nfound a similar increase in gamma power during MM, more re-\\nstricted to the PO. A possible interpretation for the posterior gam-\\nma power increase is an enhanced momentary sensory awareness,\\nas suggested by Cahn et al. (2010) . Indeed, other studies support\\nthe notion of heightened sensory awareness following meditation\\npractice ( Farb et al., 2007; Lazar et al., 2005; Nielsen and Kaszniak,\\n2006 ). For example, in the study of Farb et al. (2007) the state of\\nMM, which they termed ‘experiential-focus’ as opposed to the\\nDMN activity ‘narrative-focus’, induced in the practitioners an in-\\ncrease in activity in a right lateralized network, involving viscero-\\nsomatic areas such as the insula, secondary somatosensory cortex\\nand inferior parietal lobule.\\nAnother possible interpretation could be an increase in atten-\\ntional activity, as numerous meditation studies reported increasedattentional skills in meditation practitioners (e.g. Brefczynski-Le-\\nwis et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2008, 2009; Tang et al., 2007 ). Further,\\nthe primary oscillatory activity that is modulated by selective\\nattention is the gamma frequency range ( Fries et al., 2001; Tiitinen\\net al., 1993 ), and the brain region that modulates selective atten-\\ntional demand is the posterior parietal lobe ( Behrmann et al.,\\n2004 ). MM uses initially two skills which regulate attention, mon-\\nitoring and disengagement from distracting stimuli ( Lutz et al.,\\n2008 ). In the bipartite attentional-network model of Corbetta and\\nShulman (2002) , these attentional processes are attributed to the\\nventral system, or the ‘bottom-up’ system of attention, which in-\\ncludes the ventrolateral PFC and the temporoparietal junction. This\\nsystem carries out stimulus-driven, exogenous, bottom-up control\\nof attention, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere\\n(Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Fox et al., 2006; Serences et al.,\\n2005 ). Following this line of interpretation, during the state of\\nMM, practitioners are more engaged in monitoring and disengage-\\nment from distracting stimuli, hence PO activity rises, reﬂected by\\nan increase in local gamma activity. This interpretation also ac-\\ncounts for the increased effect over the right hemisphere, as the\\nventral system is largely lateralized to the right.\\nBoth interpretations suggested above for the largely right later-\\nalized state temporal-posterior gamma increase reﬂect the shift\\naway from narrative-focus, self-referential processing, towards\\nexperiential-focus heightened external attention and increased\\nmomentary sensory awareness.\\n4.2.2. Trait effects\\nThe only ROI where MM practitioners exhibited higher gamma\\npower compared to controls during the RS was the right PO ( Fig. 3 ).\\nThis might be interpreted as a long-term, trait increase in attention\\nallocation towards interoceptive or external sensory awareness,\\nsupporting the idea of neural plasticity in these networks in re-sponse to meditative training.\\nWe also observed signiﬁcantly decreased gamma power over\\nthe F ROIs compared to controls ( Fig. 3 ), the effect being stronger\\nfor the right hemisphere. Converging evidence based on results\\nfrom lesion and neuroimaging studies relate the right PFC with\\nself-awareness and self-related processing, such as distinguishing\\nstimuli related to one’s own self from those that are not relevant\\nto one’s own concerns ( Keenan et al., 2003 ). For instance, increased\\nactivity in the right PFC has been associated with self-recognition\\n(reviewed by Keenan et al., 2000; Morita et al., 2008 ), and with in-\\ncreased self-relevance during metacognitive evaluation of trait\\nadjectives ( Schmitz et al., 2004 ). In addition, the right PFC activa-\\ntion has been related to retrieval of episodic memories ( Allan\\net al., 2000 ; reviewed by Wheeler et al., 1997 ), and attributed to\\nautonoetic consciousness, deﬁned as the capacity to mentally rep-\\nresent and become aware of subjective experience over time\\n(Markowitsch, 2003; Wheeler et al., 1997 ). This autonoetic con-\\nsciousness, introduced by William James as the ‘Me’ ( James,1890\\n), has been given different names, including ‘‘autobiographical\\nself’’ ( Damasio and Meyer, 2009 ), ‘‘narrative self’’ ( Gallagher, 2000 )\\nand the ‘‘self-reﬂective self’’ ( Zahavi, 2011 ). However, one can also\\nbe noetically aware about one’s self, which means thinking objec-\\ntively about the world, without involving self-relevance to what-\\never one experiences ( Keenan et al., 2000 ). This phenomenon\\nwas differentiated from the ‘Me’ by William James as the ‘I’ ( James,\\n1890 ), largely characterized by momentary bodily experiencing,\\nand called by others the ‘‘core self’’ ( Damasio, 1999; Damasio\\nand Meyer, 2009 ), the ‘‘experiential or prereﬂective self’’ ( Zahavi,\\n2011 ), and the ‘‘minimal self’’: ( Gallagher, 2000 ). The largely right\\nlateralized F ROI gamma reduction seen in the MM practitioners\\ncompared to controls, both during RS and TP ( Fig. 3 ), suggests a\\ntrait transition from self-reference processing which is narrative\\nin nature, towards experiential self-reference mode.\\nThe results presented here are the ﬁrst electrophysiological evi-\\ndence for meditation-induced trait gamma power reduction within\\nthe right PFC accompanied by trait increase in right PO gamma,\\nwhich suggests a trait shift from dwelling mentally within the ex-\\ntended self with its engagement in self-processing experience, to-\\nwards the minimal, momentary and embodied experiencing self.\\n4.3. Temporal perception\\nWe found a signiﬁcant negative correlation between produced\\nduration and gamma power over both F ROIs during the TP task.\\nFurther, we found that MM practice alters temporal perception in\\nthe direction of longer produced duration. This supports the\\nhypothesis suggested by Glicksohn (2001) , based on the cogni-\\ntive-timer model ( Treisman, 1984 ), that within a TP paradigm,\\nthe more focused internally is one’s attention (as is during medita-\\ntion), the slower the rate of functioning of the cognitive timer, cou-\\npled with larger subjective time units—hence longer produced\\nduration. Yet, increasing MM proﬁciency did not have an effect,\\nsuggesting that the neuroplasticity in the temporal cognition net-\\nworks takes place in the early stages of MM practice.\\nGoing back to the issue of self-reference, the ‘I’ (core-self) and\\nthe ‘Me’ (narrative-self) have a different and complementary exis-\\ntence in the spatio-temporal domain: while the ‘Me’ places one in\\nindividual historical time and place, his or her actual past and pos-\\nsible future, the experiential ‘I’ is rooted in the here and now, in\\nmomentary experience ( Damasio, 1999 ). Our TP results, both the\\ncognitive measure and its negative correlation with frontal gamma\\npower, give further support to our suggestion that MM reduces the\\nnarrative, and increases the experiential self-reference processing.\\nFurther evidence for this line of argument comes from a recent\\nfMRI study, which revealed that ‘time dilation’ occurs in conjunc-\\ntion with the activation of several midline structures, such as theanterior cingulate and left precuneus ( Van Wassenhove et al.,\\n2011; Wittmann et al., 2010 ), related to experiential self-referen-\\ntial processing, or core-self ( Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004;\\nNorthoff et al., 2006 ).\\n4.4. Meditation depth\\nWhile we could expect a negative correlation between the MM\\nsubjective reports of meditation depth and frontal gamma power\\nduring MED, we found a positive one. This indicates that subjective\\nexperience of ‘meditation success’ requires enhanced frontal gam-\\nma activity, possibly related to narrative self-referential process-\\ning. We speculate that lower narrative self-referential processing\\nmight be subjectively experienced and judged as lower metacogni-\\ntive monitoring. Metacognitive monitoring involves the ﬂow of\\ninformation from the object level to the meta-level. It refers to\\nevaluation (bottom-up) and control (top-down) of one’s cognitive\\nprocesses. The role of the meta-level is to evaluate what is beingA.

            "page_content='monitored, and based on this evaluation, control object-level pro-\\ncessing by a feedback ﬂow of information ( Koriat, 2007; Nelson,\\n1996 ). However, Brown and Ryan (2004) make a point that mind-\\nfulness is not metacognition: ‘‘consciousness and cognition are dis-\\ntinct processing modalities. As a cognitive process, metacognition\\noperates within the realm of thought, to monitor and control cog-\\nnitive activities and to ensure that cognitive goals have been met...\\nMindfulness differs from such metacognitive processes in that its\\nmode of operation is perceptual, operating upon thought, as well\\nas upon emotion and other contents of consciousness, rather than\\nwithin them’’ (p. 243).\\n4.5. The question of meditation proﬁciency\\nIn this study we included 36 MM practitioners with great exper-\\ntise variability, ranging between 180 - 23,000 h, grouped in three\\ngroups. Albeit the large expertise range, we did not ﬁnd any MM\\nexpertise-related signiﬁcant effects in gamma power for the F\\nROI during RS or TP, suggesting that the trait shift in self-reference\\nmode from narrative-focused to experiential-focused occurs in\\nearly stages of MM practice. This conclusion is further supported\\nbyFarb et al. (2007) , who provided evidence that after MM training\\nof two months there was a state shift in self-reference processing\\nduring meditation. Our results indicate that the shift in self-refer-\\nence mode is: (1) a trait, and not only a state, acquired following a\\nshort MM training (in the range of hundreds of formal practice\\nhours); and (2) could be clearly seen noninvasively over the fron-\\ntal, especially right hemisphere, in the gamma band of the EEG.\\nIn addition, MM expertise did not affect the state (measured\\nduring MED) gamma power increase over T and PO ROIs, as well\\nas the trait right PO gamma power (measured during RS or TP),\\nattributed to increased attentional skills and heightened aware-\\nness to internal and external sensory stimuli. This disagrees with\\nthe results reported by Cahn et al. (2010) , who found that medita-\\ntion-related increases in occipital gamma power signiﬁcantly\\ncovaried with meditational expertise, indexed by total years of dai-\\nly practice. However, Cahn et al. (2010) compared 10 practitioners\\nwith over 10 years of practice with 6 practitioners having less than\\n5 years of practice. In comparison, our study included a much lar-\\nger group sample, within the same expertise range (15 participants\\nhad > 10 years of practice, 7 had > 5 years, and 14 were in be-\\ntween). Another study which tested the correlation between the\\ntotal hours of formal meditation and overall gamma power in eight\\nlong-term practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism reported a positive\\ncorrelation coefﬁcient, which did not, however, reach signiﬁcance\\n(Lutz et al., 2004 ).\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn this study we employed EEG to investigate whether the reg-\\nular practice of mindfulness meditation (MM) affects self-referen-\\ntial processing, either as short-term (state) or as long-term (trait)\\neffect, in relation to practice proﬁciency. To this end, we ﬁrst iden-\\ntiﬁed the electrophysiological changes associated with the transi-\\ntion from resting state to a simple time production task—lower\\ngamma power over frontal and midline regions. This effect was\\nsimilar in practitioners and controls. We then continued by com-\\nparing our three groups of MM practitioners to matched controls\\nduring a resting state, and showed that MM practitioners exhibited\\nlower frontal gamma activity, mainly right-lateralized, related to\\nnarrative self-reference and default mode network activity. In\\naddition, we have identiﬁed state increases in temporal and pari-\\neto-occipital (PO) gamma power, largely lateralized to the right,\\nattributed to an increase in attentional skills and heightenedawareness to internal and external sensory stimuli. An increase\\nin right PO gamma power was also found in the MM practitioners,\\ncompared to controls, during the resting state, indicating a trait\\neffect. Taken together, these results support the notion that the\\nregular practice of MM induces a shift away from narrative\\nself-referential processing towards an experiential and momentary\\nself-reference processing.\\nFinally, the state and trait MM-induced changes in gamma\\nactivity were found to be irrespective of expertise level, suggesting\\nthat: (i) the shift in habitual self-referential processing from narra-\\ntive to experiential focus, and (ii) the increase in attentional skills\\nand heightened awareness to internal and external sensory stimuli,\\nboth occur in the earlier stages of MM practice, within the ﬁrst\\n1000 h of practice.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis paper is based on a Ph.D. dissertation (ﬁrst author), super-\\nvised by the second and third authors.

Recently, Carhart-Harris and\\ncolleagues introduced the hypothesis that the degree of\\nentropy of spontaneous brain activity indexes the ‘richness’\\nof conscious subjective experience ( Carhart-Harris et al.,\\n2014 ). Entropy is a dimensionless quantity derived from\\nthe theory of statistical mechanics that can be interpreted\\nas the degree of disorder present in a physical system\\n(Ben-Naim, 2012 ). As expressed by the proponents of\\nthe hypothesis: ‘‘ The great merit of applying the measure\\nof entropy in cognitive neuroscience is that it is uniquely\\nadept at bridging the physical and subjective divide; mereﬂip sides of the same coin – but diﬀerent sides nonethe-\\nless”. According to this proposal, low-entropy brain states\\npresent a reduced repertoire of potential conﬁgurations,and thus are subjectively experienced as states of dimin-\\nished conscious awareness ( Schartner et al., 2015;\\n2017b; Hudetz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018 ). Conversely,\\nhigh-entropy brain states are experienced as content-rich, but at the same time as unpredictable and therefore\\nuncertain ( Tagliazucchi et al., 2014; Cavanna et al.,\\n2017; Carhart-Harris, 2018 ), and thus enabling subjective\\nexperiences beyond the scope of everyday awareness.As an example, the acute eﬀects of serotonergic psychede-\\nlics (i.e. serotonin 5-HT\\n2Areceptor agonists), glutamatergic\\ndissociatives (i.e. NMDA receptor antagonists) ( Schartner\\net al., 2017a; Viol et al., 2017; 2019 ) and a nonselective\\nadenosine antagonist stimulant (caﬀeine) ( Chang et al.,\\n2018 ) have been linked to high-entropy brain oscillations\\nor, equivalently, to reduced levels of compressibility.\\nIn the information-theoretical sense, entropy\\nrepresents the amount of information needed to specifythe microstate of the system or, equivalently, its level of\\nuncertainty and unpredictability.\\n1The biological meaning\\nof brain entropy depends upon the experimental variable\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.01.033\\n0306-4522/ /C2112020 IBRO.

            "page_content='under study. The large-scale oscillations in scalp potential\\nthat are measured using electroencephalography (EEG)\\nare frequently employed as markers of physiological,pathological and pharmacologically-induced global brainstates (e.g. sleep, epilepsy, coma, anesthesia). Thus, the\\nentropy of such global brain oscillations could\\napproximate the uncertainty of the distribution of potentialbrain conﬁgurations, yielding an objective marker of the\\nsubjectively felt ‘richness’ of conscious experience.\\nWe propose that the brain state achieved by expert\\nmeditators is associated with increased entropy of brain\\noscillatory activity. This hypothesis is supported by the\\nobservation that the extended practice of certainmeditation traditions is associated with an enlarged\\nrepertoire of subjective experiences in comparison to\\nordinary conscious wakefulness ( Brandmeyer et al.,\\n2019 ). In particular, many of these features are common\\nto the acute eﬀects of serotonergic psychedelics. These\\nfeatures include a shift towards positive mood and emo-\\ntions, increased cognitive ﬂexibility and emotional dysreg-ulation or mood lability, altered self-awareness, a state of\\na ‘dreamlike’ quality, and the collapse of the intentional\\nstructure of subject/object (non-dual awareness)(Carhart-Harris and Nutt 2014; Travis, 2014; Nichols,\\n2016; Nour and Carhart-Harris, 2017; Millie `re et al.,\\n2018 ). Both meditation and the use of serotonergic psy-\\nchedelics are frequently associated with the intention ofobtaining ‘insights’ about the nature of ‘objective reality’\\nand the self ( Barrett and Griﬃths, 2018 ). Furthermore,\\nevidence suggests that certain meditative practices(Strauss et al., 2014; Haukaas et al., 2018 ) and seroton-\\nergic psychedelics ( Griﬃths et al., 2016; Carhart-Harris\\net al., 2017, 2018; Dos Santos et al., 2018; Garcia-Romeu and Richards, 2018; Palhano-Fontes et al.,\\n2018 ) can lead to prolonged positive eﬀects in patients\\nsuﬀering from depression and anxiety, raising the possi-bility of increased brain entropy as a common mechanism\\nunderlying these eﬀects ( Carhart-Harris, 2018 ).\\nIt is now widely recognized that, by itself, the term\\n‘meditation’ is non-speciﬁc, and that it has beenfrequently applied to heterogeneous practices, both in\\nterms of cultural background and the instructions\\nfollowed to meditate ( Braboszcz et al., 2017 ). To evaluate\\nour hypothesis while also accounting for this heterogene-\\nity, we investigated EEG data acquired from three groups\\nof expert meditators following diﬀerent traditions: Hima-laya Yoga (HT), Vipassana (VIP) and Isha Yoga (SNY).\\nThese traditions can be placed along a continuum ranging\\nfrom ‘focused attention’ (FA) to ‘open monitoring’ (OM)meditation ( Lutz et al., 2008; Lippelt et al., 2014 ). HT uses\\na mantra to maintain attentional focus and can be classi-\\nﬁed as FA. SNY meditators practiced Shoonya medita-\\ntion, consisting of a process of conscious ‘non-doing’while remaining unresponsive to internal or external stim-\\nuli, which can be classiﬁed as OM. In between these two\\nextremes, VIP requires practitioners to sustain their focus(‘samatha’) in the process of mentally scanning bodily\\nsensations; however, a key component of this meditation\\nis the insight (or meta-awareness, ‘vipasyana’) of distract-ing elements, which must be identiﬁed and then released\\nto continue with the process of FA ( Lutz et al., 2007 ).The local entropy of band-speciﬁc oscillatory activity\\nat each scalp electrode was complemented with the\\nanalysis of two global metrics: the long-range coherenceof oscillations, and its ﬂuctuations over time (i.e.metastability). Both metrics are motivated by theoretical\\naccounts of consciousness and have been empirically\\nshown to depend on the level of awareness ( Carhart-\\nHarris et al., 2014; Schartner et al., 2015, 2017a,b ).\\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\\nWe investigated a publicly available EEG dataset. Further\\ninformation on the experimental procedures can be found\\nin a previous publication ( Braboszcz et al., 2017 ). All\\ncodes used in this manuscript can be found in https://\\ngithub.com/enzotagliazucchi/meditation-entropy .\\nParticipants\\nThirty controls (CTR), 27 HT meditators, 20 VIP\\nmeditators and 27 SNY meditators were recruited based\\non age, gender and years of practice. The controlsubjects were chosen for inclusion in this study basedon age, gender, and the absence of meditation practice.\\nThe experiment was approved by the local ethics\\ncommittee and by the ethics committee of the UniversityCalifornia San Diego. The experiments were carried out\\nat the Meditation Research Institute (MRI) in Rishikesh,\\nIndia. Groups were matched by age and gender,resulting in 16 controls (45 /C610 years, ﬁve females), 16\\nHT meditators (43 /C612 years, 2 females), 16 SNY\\nmeditators (40 /C610 years, 2 females) and 16 VIP\\nmeditators (47 /C615 years, ﬁve females). A single group\\nof subjects acted as control for all three meditation\\ntraditions.\\nExperimental design\\nAll participants were instructed to keep their eyes open\\nand choose between sitting on a blanket on the ﬂoor or\\non a chair. The experiment was divided into twosessions lasting 20 min each, one labeled as\\n‘Meditation’ and the other as ‘Instructed Mind\\nWandering’. The order of the sessions wascounterbalanced between participants to prevent ordereﬀects. In the ‘Meditation’ condition, participants\\nprepared for their meditation practice (focusing on\\nbreath or on exhalation/inhalation) during 10 min andwere subsequently instructed to engage in meditation\\nduring the last 10 min. Controls performed the same\\ninstruction given to the meditators throughout the 20 minof the condition. In the ‘Instructed Mind Wandering’\\ncondition, participants were instructed to remember\\nautobiographical events from childhood up until therecent past. The present analysis is based oncomparing the second half of the ‘Meditation’ condition\\nbetween meditators and controls. As additional checks,\\nwe also compared the ‘Instructed Mind Wandering’condition of the controls vs. the ‘Meditation’ condition of\\nthe meditators, and the baseline condition (preparation\\nfor meditation) between both groups.R.

A high-pass ﬁlter with 1 Hz cutoﬀ (inﬁnite\\nresponse ﬁlter), a transition bandwidth of 0.3 Hz, and anorder of six was applied to the EEG time series.\\nEEGLAB automated artifact rejections routines were\\nalso applied. A manual procedure described with detailin a previous publication ( Braboszcz et al., 2017 ) was fol-\\nlowed to reject 8 s. epochs with very high/low frequency\\ncontent. Bad electrodes (0–18 bad electrodes per subject,average of ﬁve electrodes per subject) were identiﬁedvisually and removed from the analysis. The Infomax\\nindependent component analysis algorithm was applied\\nto reject artifacts related to eye movement and muscleactivity.\\nBandpass ﬁltering and the Hilbert transform\\nWe focused our analyses on the following canonical\\nfrequency bands: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha\\n(8–12 Hz), beta (12–20 Hz), low gamma (20–60 Hz) and\\nhigh gamma (60–100 Hz). Our choice of computing theentropy of the envelope of band-speciﬁc oscillations is\\nbased on the following two considerations. First, narrow\\nfrequency bands have been linked to speciﬁc brainfunctions, cognitive domains and, in particular, to the\\nmeditative state ( Buzsaki, 2006; Braboszcz et al., 2017 ).\\nSecond, it is unclear how the spectral content of broadbandsignal ﬂuctuations biases entropy estimates or, equiva-lently, to which extent the entropy of broadband signals\\nprovides information complementary to spectral analysis.\\nFor each EEG channel, we applied a 4th order\\nButterworth bandpass ﬁlter to obtain the narrow band\\nsignals in the above-mentioned ranges. We then\\nobtained the analytical representation of the ﬁltered timeseries using the Hilbert transform. As illustrated in\\nFig. 1 A, given a real-valued signal xtðÞ, the Hilbert\\ntransform yields a complex representation (analyticsignal) given by ztðÞ¼ utðÞþ iv tðÞ¼ xtðÞþ iH x tðÞðÞ , with\\nHxtðÞðÞ indicating the Hilbert transform of the real-valued\\nsignal xtðÞ. From this representation, the instantaneous\\namplitude can be computed asﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\\nutðÞ\\n2þvtðÞ2q\\n, and the\\ninstantaneous phase as tan/C01vtðÞ\\nutðÞ/C16/C17\\n.\\nSample entropy (SE)\\nThe SE is an estimate of the complexity (or, equivalently,\\nof the regularity or predictability) of a time series that isbased on counting repetitions of patterns in the data\\n(Richman and Moorman, 2000 ). SE measures the proba-\\nbility of observing similar (within a certain tolerance bound[r]) patterns of a ﬁxed length in the time series, compared\\nto the result obtained from the same computation based\\non patterns of length increased by one sample. The length\\nof the patterns is determined by the embedding dimension(m). In contrast to recent publications, we chose SE\\ninstead of the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, since LZ esti-\\nmates information in the algorithmic sense (i.e. compress-ibility) and requires arbitrary binarization of the data\\n(Schartner et al., 2015 ), while SE can be applied to con-\\ntinuous signals and yields entropy estimates more directlyrelated to the statistical mechanical (Gibbs’) and informa-\\ntion theoretical (Shannon’s) deﬁnitions of entropy.\\nThe detailed procedure followed to compute SE is\\nexplained in the Appendix. The key computation is\\nSE¼log\\n#Smþ1rðÞ\\n#SmrðÞ/C16/C17\\n, where # Smand # Sm+1represent the\\nnumber of template vectors of embedding dimension m\\nand m+ 1, respectively, within tolerance r. Following\\nprevious publications (e.g. Al-Angari and Sahakian,\\n2007; Bruce et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012; Zhang and\\nZhou, 2012; Yentes et al., 2013 ), we set the value of\\nthe embedding dimension to m¼2. It is also customary\\nto express the tolerance r as proportional to the standard\\ndeviation (SD) of the time series; here we setr¼0:2/C2SD (see the Appendix for further details).\\nFinally, to reduce the impact of autocorrelations in the\\ndata, we considered\\ns¼32 ms.\\nMetastability and coherence\\nConsider Ncoupled oscillators (in this case, each of the 64\\nbandpass-ﬁltered EEG channels can be conceptualized as\\nan oscillator), each with its own characteristic oscillationfrequency\\nxi. The instantaneous amount of synchrony\\nbetween the ensemble of oscillators can be measured\\nwith the Kuramoto order parameter. The order parameterRtðÞranges between 0 and 1, indicating minimum and\\nmaximum synchrony, respectively ( Shanahan, 2010 ).\\nThe metastability (K) is computed as the temporal variance\\nofRtðÞ, and indicates the amplitude of the dynamical reper-\\ntoire of the oscillators (i.e. the occurrence of transient syn-\\nchronization and de-synchronization over time). The\\ncoherence C is computed as the mean of RtðÞ, and indi-\\ncates the average level of synchronization between all\\noscillators. The procedure followed to compute K and C\\nis outlined in Fig. 1 C, and explained with further detail in\\nthe Appendix.\\nRandom forest (RF) classiﬁers\\nTo evaluate whether changes in SE represent signatures\\nspeciﬁc to each of the meditative traditions, we used thisdata to train and evaluate a class of machine learningclassiﬁers known as RF ( Breiman, 2001 ). RF are built\\non the simpler decision tree classiﬁer, in which thresholds\\nare introduced for each feature so that the training set issplit in two at every node of the tree. The thresholds are\\nselected to maximize a measure of sample purity result-\\ning from the division; the highest possible purity value is42 R. M.

If this\\nis not the case, the next feature is evaluated and thethreshold is recursively determined until the highest purityvalue is obtained or all features are exhausted.\\nThe RF algorithm is based on training a relatively\\nlarge number of decision trees (in this case 1.000 trees)so that the impact of noise at a particular feature is\\nattenuated. Furthermore, to reduce the inﬂuence of\\nnoisy or unreliable features, each individual decisiontree is based on a random selection of features from the\\noriginal data. Here we follow the rule of thumb of\\nconsideringﬃﬃﬃppfeatures, where pis the original number\\nof features. For less than 100 features, this choiceapproximates very well the\\noriginal value of b1þlog\\n2ðpÞc\\nproposed by L. Breiman in hisoriginal publication of thealgorithm ( Breiman, 2001 ). Once\\ntrained, to predict the class for a\\nnew sample a probability is esti-mated by counting how many trees\\npredict each class, divided by the\\ntotal number of trees. The ﬁnalclass is decided by a majority vote.\\nThis procedure is illustrated in\\nFig. 1 D.\\nFor each frequency band we\\nconsidered 64 features\\ncorresponding to the SE entropyvalues at each EEG electrodelocation, and trained 200\\nindependent RF classiﬁers to\\ndistinguish CTR from HT, VIP andSNY ( Abraham et al., 2014 ). As a\\nmeasure of classiﬁer accuracy,\\nwe obtained the area under theROC curve (AUC). For each clas-\\nsiﬁer, we applied a stratiﬁed split\\ninto two equally sized sets (trainingand testing). We also applied thesame procedure after randomly\\nshuﬄing the labels of the samples\\nto evaluate the statistical signiﬁ-cance of the AUC. An empirical p-\\nvalue was constructed by counting\\nhow many times the AUC obtainedfrom data with shuﬄed labels\\nexceeded the AUC obtained from\\nthe unshuﬄed data.\\nFinally, we investigated the\\ngeneralization accuracy by\\ntraining the RF classiﬁers usingdata from one binary decisionproblem (e.g. CTR vs. VIP) and\\nthen evaluating the AUC obtained\\nfrom applying them to a diﬀerentbinary decision problem (e.g. CTR\\nvs. HT).\\nStatistical analysis\\nWe applied the Kruskal-Wallis\\n(KW) test, a non-parametric version of analysis ofvariance (ANOVA), to assess the eﬀects of the\\nexperimental group (CTR, HT, VIP and SNY) on SE\\n(averaged across all channels), C, and K. Whenever asigniﬁcant eﬀect of group was detected, we conducted\\npost-hoc non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon signed-\\nrank tests between data from CTR and from eachmeditative tradition.

The heterogene-\\nity found in these reports highlights the ambiguous nature\\nof the term ‘meditation’ ( Brandmeyer et al., 2019;\\nSchoenberg and Vago, 2019 ). Our analyses extended\\nprevious ﬁndings by showing how meditation canincrease signal complexity in the alpha and gamma\\nbands, as indexed by SE. In particular, SE changes in\\nVIP appeared as stereotypical, in the sense that theyallowed machine learning classiﬁers to correctly general-\\nize to the problem of detecting other meditative states\\nfrom EEG signal entropy. Increased alpha and gammapower envelope entropy was observed for Vipassana\\nmeditation vs. controls, both when comparing meditation\\nvs. focus on breathing and instructed mind wandering inthe group of matched controls. However, we did notobserve diﬀerences when comparing the ‘focus on\\nbreathing’ condition between meditators and controls,\\nsuggesting that our results are an active manifestationof engagement in meditation and do not reﬂect a trait\\neﬀect.\\nThe analyses conducted in the present work have\\nrelatively few antecedents. A previous study reported\\ndecreased permutation entropy (a method closely\\nrelated to SE) during the practice of insight meditation(Vipassana) ( Venugopala et al., 2017 ), which was also\\nassociated with increased levels of synchronization\\nbetween the signals registered at the EEG electrodes.Increased gamma synchronization during the meditativestate is consistent with our ﬁndings ( Lutz et al., 2004 ).\\nHowever, we found the opposite result for entropy (i.e.\\nincreased) when compared to the result reported byVenugopala and colleagues (i.e. decreased). We note\\nthat this discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that\\nwe did not investigate the entropy of the broadbandEEG signal, but of the envelopes of narrow band oscilla-\\ntions. As mentioned earlier, in contrast to previous stud-\\nies, our method allows to disentangle changes in theentropy of the envelope (possibly related to the size of cellassemblies whose activity oscillates at the carrier fre-\\nquency) from the spectral content of the broadband sig-\\nnal, which contains unspeciﬁc contributions of cellassemblies oscillating at very diﬀerent frequencies (i.e.\\n1/f spectrum).\\nThe frequency bands where we found the most salient\\nincreases in entropy during meditation are consistent with\\nthe previous report by Braboszcz and colleagues\\ncomparing EEG spectral power between meditators andcontrols ( Braboszcz et al., 2017 ) using the same dataset\\nwe analyzed. They reported increased occipital (Oz) EEG\\npower for all meditation traditions vs. controls in the alpha(7–11 Hz) and gamma (60–110 Hz) ranges; see Fig. 3 inBraboszcz et al. (2017) . Gamma band increases were\\nlocated in occipito-parietal scalp positions, while alpha\\nband increases were seen across all electrodes; seeFigs. 4 and 6 in Braboszcz et al. (2017) , respectively.\\nThese results are consistent with the topographic localiza-\\ntion of increased alpha and gamma oscillation envelopeentropies shown in Fig. 3 .\\nOur results are also consistent with the observation of\\nincreased long-range coherence in the gamma(25–56 Hz) band during the meditative state of Buddhistpractitioners of the Nyingmapa and Kagyupa traditions.\\n2\\nVipassana meditation was reported to increase localgamma (35–45 Hz) power in parieto-occipital scalpregions ( Cahn et al., 2010 ), overlapping with those reported\\ninFig. 3 . Gamma band oscillations are implicated in several\\nhigh-order cognitive processes such as attention, working\\n2These traditions differ from Vipassana in their instructions and\\nobjectives, and are described as ‘loving-kindness’ and ‘compassion’meditation, with the objective of achieving a state of ‘unconditional\\nloving-kindness and compassion, resulting in unrestricted readiness\\nand availability to help living beings’.46 R.

They have also been postulated as a plausi-\\nble neurobiological mechanism to solve the ‘binding prob-lem’ (i.e. the integration of information between spatiallydistributed cortical regions) ( Nikolic ´et al., 2013 ). In contrast\\nwith our results, Lutz et al. discuss a number of reports\\nimplicating slow oscillations with the meditative state(Lutz et al., 2007 ). However, and as also noted by the\\nauthors, these results could be biased by two fundamental\\nfactors: (1) fast oscillations were not investigated and (2)the studies were based on FA meditation, which could\\nengage top-down control mechanisms related to the onset\\nof slower brain oscillations.\\nBecause the neurophysiological correlates of\\nmeditation have been historically confounded by several\\nfactors, the comparison of our results with the previousliterature is diﬃcult, especially so given that there arevirtually no antecedents of articles investigating the\\nentropy of band-speciﬁc oscillations. A major source of\\nconfusion is the nature of the meditative traditions thatare investigated. Our unidimensional classiﬁcation of\\nmeditation traditions from FA to OA is only one among\\nother characterizations. As stated by Lutz et al. (2004) ,\\nthe EEG gamma band has not been measured in most\\nelectrophysiological studies of the meditative state. This\\nis supported by a recent review and meta-analysis articlebyThomas and Cohen (2014 ) (see Tables 2, 3, and 4 for\\nFA, OA and transcendental meditation, respectively). It is\\napparent that FA studies generally reveal increases in the\\ntheta and alpha bands, while the results are less homoge-neous for OM meditation.\\nBeyond the similarities in their phenomenology, both\\npsychedelics and the meditative state have beeninvestigated using fMRI to reveal decreased activity in\\nthe posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a posterior ‘hub’ of\\nthe default mode network (DMN) ( Carhart-Harris et al.,\\n2012; Berkovich-Ohana et al., 2016; Smigielski et al.,\\n2019 ). Such inactivation has been compared to the disen-\\ngagement of a ‘reducing valve’, leading to less constraintson the potential repertoire of brain activity conﬁgurations(Carhart-Harris et al., 2012; Carhart-Harris et al., 2014 ).\\nWe measured the entropy of narrow band EEG power\\nﬂuctuations as a quantitative metric of such dysregulation.However, we note that entropy should not be used as an\\nabsolute proxy for the level of consciousness, since a\\nvery high level of entropy implies that the constituents ofthe system (e.g. neurons) behave independently in the\\nstatistical sense, preventing information integration. Giulio\\nTononi postulated that measuring the balance betweenthe enhanced repertoire of states and the level of informa-tion integration could result in a more adequate metric for\\nconsciousness than entropy alone ( Oizumi et al., 2014 ).\\nThe proposed metric ( h) is diﬃcult to compute, but can\\nbe approximated empirically by measuring EEG after a\\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, a tech-\\nnique that could be used in future studies to investigatethe meditative state ( Casali et al., 2013 ).\\nBoth long-term meditation ( Sahdra et al., 2011;\\nStrauss et al., 2014; Haukaas et al., 2018; Pokorski andSuchorzynska, 2018 ) and the acute eﬀects of serotoner-\\ngic psychedelics ( Griﬃths et al., 2016; Carhart-Harriset al., 2017; Carhart-Harris et al., 2018; Dos Santos\\net al., 2018; Garcia-Romeu and Richards, 2018;\\nPalhano-Fontes et al., 2018 ) have been reported to\\nenhance mood and well-being. Increased brain entropyhas been reported during the acute eﬀects of psychede-\\nlics, and was shown to predict changes in personality\\ntraits ( Lebedev et al., 2016 ). Recently, Carhart-Harris\\nand Nutt suggested that 5-HT\\n2Asignaling mediates ‘active\\ncoping’, a process characterized by enhanced plasticity\\n(Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017 ). According to this pro-\\nposal, 5-HT 2Aagonism increases the excitability of the\\nbrain or, ﬁguratively, its ‘temperature’, drawing an analogy\\nwith a metal heated and subsequently cooled in order toincrease its malleability (a process known as ‘annealing’).\\nThus, the potential long-term beneﬁts of 5-HT\\n2Aagonism\\ncould relate to the increased ﬂexibility induced by a tran-sient state of higher entropy, potentiating brain plasticity(Carhart-Harris et al., 2014; Carhart-Harris and Nutt,\\n2017 ). The process of Vipassana meditation, which\\nresulted in most of the EEG entropy increases observedin our study, can be compared to the process proposed\\nby Carhart-Harris and Nutt. FA alone can lead to a state\\nof ‘dullness’; therefore, the excitation brought upon by dis-traction and the meta-awareness of such distraction is\\nneeded in equal measure. In other words, a balance\\nbetween excitation and FA is required. Vipassana medita-tion can be conceptualized as a process of continuouslyincreasing brain excitability and then reducing it after the\\ndistractor is examined and excluded from consciousness\\nby the meditator. Future studies of gene expression (epi-genetics) and positron emission tomography (PET) in\\nexpert Vipassana meditators should be conducted to\\nidentify whether this ‘annealing’ process is only usefulas an analogy, or is indeed mediated by increased\\nexpression of the genes that encode 5-HT\\n2Areceptors,\\nas well as by higher levels of 5-HT 2Areceptor density.\\nAdvances in the development of 5-HT 2Aagonist PET radi-\\noligands, such as Cimbi-36 ( Ettrup et al., 2016 ), represent\\na promising avenue of research to evaluate thishypothesis.\\nWe note that while increased entropy has been\\nreported for the acute eﬀects of diﬀerent compounds\\n(e.g. 5-HT\\n2A agonists and NMDA antagonists)\\n(Schartner et al., 2017a ), our results provide evidence\\nof ‘endogenous’ increases, i.e. increased EEG entropy\\nthat is not mediated by pharmacological agents but bythe mental processes executed by long-term meditators.\\nFurthermore, our analyses identiﬁed the spectral bands\\nthat become more disorganized, matching those predom-inantly aﬀected by 5-HT\\n2Aagonists (alpha rhythm)\\n(Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013; Carhart-Harris et al.,\\n2016 ) and by meditation in expert practitioners (gamma\\nrhythm) ( Lutz et al., 2004 ). While most of the studies to\\ndate investigated the entropic brain hypothesis from the\\nperspective of broadband oscillations, our work puts for-\\nward novel results that should lead to a re-examinationof brain states of higher entropy in terms of the aﬀected\\nfrequency bands.\\nThe observed changes in coherence and metastability\\nsuggest that the repertoire of cells recruited for band-\\nspeciﬁc oscillations was locally increased duringR.

            "page_content='meditation while, at a more global scale, increased\\ngamma band binding reduced such repertoire. This\\nconﬂict between local and global changes in thepotential repertoire of brain states is consistent withﬁndings obtained under the acute eﬀects of LSD,\\nsuggesting increased global functional integration at the\\nexpense of locally segregated activity ( Tagliazucchi\\net al., 2016 ). Further electrophysiological studies using\\n5-HT\\n2Aagonists and NMDA antagonists could be con-\\nducted to allow a direct comparison of local entropy andglobal metastability/coherence with those quantiﬁed dur-\\ning the meditative state.\\nOur study represents a step towards establishing an\\nintuitive relationship between the enhancement of\\nphenomenological space and increases in the entropy of\\nbrain activity, as proposed by Carhart-Harris et al.\\n(2014 ). However, our study also presents limitations\\nintrinsic to the use of EEG to infer the location of changes\\nin entropy, since EEG electrode signals reaching the\\nscalp from diﬀerent cortical sources are ‘mixed’ due to vol-ume conduction eﬀects. Furthermore, while a psychome-\\ntric assessment of the participants was available, it was\\nnot suitable for the comparison of phenomenological fea-tures with those of the psychedelic state. For this pur-\\npose, other questionnaires -such as the Altered States\\nof Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire ( Dittrich, 1998 )-\\nshould be employed. Due to this limitation, we can onlyprovide indirect evidence of increased entropy as a mech-\\nanism underlying the phenomenological similarity\\nbetween the meditative and the psychedelic states.\\nIn summary, Vipassana meditation, a practice that can\\nbe classiﬁed as midway between OA and FA, resulted in\\nincreased entropy of the envelope of brain oscillations inthe alpha and low/high gamma bands. This suggested\\nthat the increased repertoire of local neural\\nconﬁgurations was mediated by higher levels of localsegregation alongside increased global coherence in the\\nlow/high gamma bands. Our study provides an example\\nof a non-pharmacologically-induced brain state of highentropy. Future research should address whether these‘endogenous’ increases in EEG entropy are related to\\nchanges in the expression of 5-HT\\n2Areceptors in expert\\nmeditators, and study the relationship between entropy,ﬂexibility, and the long-term positive eﬀects that certain\\nmeditative traditions can have on physical and mental\\nhealth.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Braboszcz and colleagues for sharing the EEG\\ndata together alongside their publication.

In this\\ndeﬁnition, the parameter m is called the embedding\\ndimension, a name inherited from the process of\\nreconstructing an attractor from a time series by meansof a discrete sequence of observations ( Takens, 1981 ).\\nThe procedure followed to compute SE is illustrated in\\nFig. 1 B. We consider a time series of length N, given by\\nx\\n1;x2;x3;/C1/C1/C1 ;xN fg , with homogeneous spacing between\\nsamples ( s), i.e. xi/C0xj/C12/C12/C12/C12=s. For the purposes of this\\nanalysis, the time series represents the instantaneousamplitude of the narrow band frequency envelopesobtained from the Hilbert transform. The template\\nvectors of length m are deﬁned as\\nX\\nmiðÞ¼ xi;xiþ1;xiþ2;/C1/C1/C1 ;xiþm/C01 fg . Given a suitable\\ndistance function d (in this implementation, the\\nChebyshev distance), the distance between two\\ntemplate vectors of equal length is deﬁned asdX miðÞ;XmjðÞ ðÞ . Then, for a given embedding dimension\\nm and tolerance r, we deﬁne the set\\nSmrðÞ¼ i;j:dX miðÞ;XmjðÞ ðÞ /C20 rand i–j fg ;i.e. all the\\npairs of diﬀerent indices such that the associatedtemplate vectors are considered similar within a certain\\ntolerance. Finally, we compute the SE as,\\nSE¼/C0log#Smþ1rðÞ\\n#SmrðÞ/C18/C19\\nð1Þ\\n(# denotes set cardinality). We observe that, by\\nconstruction, Smþ1rðÞ/C20 SmrðÞ, therefore SE is equal or\\nlarger than zero. Also, we note that self-matches are not\\nincluded in the computation of SE. Due to the exclusion\\nof self-matches, SE results in a less biased estimate ofentropy relative to other metrics (e.g. approximateentropy). Also, instead of matching the patterns against\\na ﬁxed template, all possible segments of length m are\\nconsidered as templates, which increases the statisticalpower in Eq. (1). SE can be conceptualized as\\nmeasuring the amount of self-similarity in the data: a\\nhighly regular and periodical time series will present ahigh SE, while a noisier and less predictable time series\\nwill present a lower SE.\\nIn spite of its name, the embedding dimension is not\\nestimated to guarantee the reconstruction of an attractorunderlying the time series, but from practical\\nconsiderations concerning the computation of the\\nlogarithmic likelihood in Eq. (1). As discussed by both\\nKaﬀashi et al. (2008 ), and Pincus and Goldberger\\n(1994 ), the preferred choice m= 2 allows a better esti-\\nmate of the logarithmic likelihood, since #S\\nmrðÞis a\\ndecreasing function of m. Concerning the tolerance, pre-\\nvious numerical studies showed that r/C200:1/C2SD leads\\nto poor logarithmic likelihood estimates, while forr/C210:25/C2SD relevant information is lost. Therefore, we\\nfollowed the recommendation of adopting an intermediate\\nvalue ( r¼0:2/C2SD).\\nMetastability and coherence\\nConsider Ncoupled oscillators, each with its own\\ncharacteristic oscillation frequency\\nxi. These\\nfrequencies represent those of the narrow-band ﬁltered64 EEG channel signals. The instantaneous amount of\\nsynchrony between the ensemble of oscillators can be\\nmeasured with the Kuramoto order parameter,\\nRtðÞ¼1\\nNXN\\nj¼1eihj/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12/C12 ð2Þ\\nThe order parameter RtðÞranges between 0 and 1,\\nindicating minimum and maximum synchrony,respectively. From Eq. (2)we derive the metastability K\\nas the variance of RtðÞ, indicating the amplitude of the\\ndynamical repertoire of the oscillators (i.e. the\\noccurrence of transient synchronization and de-synchronization over time), and the coherence C as the\\nmean of RtðÞ, indicating the average level of\\nsynchronization between the oscillators.50 R.

By\\ncontrast, itispossible that during theinstructed mind-wandering session control participants\\nand Isha shoonya meditators used ahigher degree ofinhibitory mechanisms tofocus ontheir\\nthoughts, thus reaching alevel ofalpha activation equivalent toVipassana.\\nMeditation state andtraiteffects\\nNomeditation state effects were found.

Itislikely that during the\\ninstructed mind-wandering task some ofourmeditators kept asimilar non judgmental attitude\\ntowards their experiences that they have when meditating. Another issue isthat during medita-\\ntion, even forexperienced meditators, mind-wandering cannot beavoided. Itisthus likely that\\nsome ofourmeditators hadepisodes ofmind wandering during themeditation task and that\\nsome hadepisodes ofmeditation during themind-wandering task.\\nHowever, wearereporting ameditation trait effect inthehigh gamma 60±110 Hzfre-\\nquency range over theparieto-occipital electrodes inallthethree types ofmeditation westud-\\niedhere.

Showing\\nthat different meditation traditions share common neural correlates isimportant because it\\nindicates that theclinical benefits ofthese practices [1,80]could besimilar.

Longitudinal studies ofmeditative practice with random selection oftheparticipants\\ntraining inmeditation would beuseful inthedelineation ofthelikely complicated interplay of\\nneurophysiological state and trait effects asthey sequentially engage over thecourse ofmedita-\\ntivetraining. Such studies could also help unravel individual differences inthepre-meditation\\ntraining baseline that caninfluence thedevelopment oftrait and state effects ofmeditation.\\nOne could also argue that ourresults might have been influenced bythefactthat during the\\nmeditation condition, thecontrol participants did2times 10minutes ofthesame breath focus\\ntask whereas themeditators did10minutes ofbreath focus and then 10minutes ofanew task\\ninform oftheir specific meditation practice.

Electrophysiological  activity,  i.e. EEG,  was recorded  from  11 subjects  with \\nvarying  degrees  of meditation  experience  during  Zen meditation  (a form  of open  monitoring  \\nmeditation)  and during  non-meditation  rest. On a behavioral  level,  mindfulness  scores  were  \\nassessed  using  the Mindfulness  Attention  and Awareness  Scale  (MAAS).  Analysis  of EEG  source  \\npower  revealed  the so far unreported  finding  that MAAS  scores  significantly  correlated  with \\ngamma  power  (30-250 Hz), particularly  high-frequency  gamma  (100-245 Hz), during  meditation.  \\nHigh  levels  of mindfulness  were  related  to increased  high-frequency  gamma,  for example,  in the \\ncingulate  cortex  and somatosensory  cortices.  Further , we analyzed  the relationship  between  \\nconnectivity  during  meditation  and self-reported  mindfulness  (MAAS) . We found  a correlation  \\nbetween  graph  meas ures in the 160-170 Hz range  and MAAS  scores.

            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n3 1 Introduction  \\nIn recent  years,  the study  of meditation  has become  increasingly  popular  in neuroscience.  In its \\nproficient  form,  meditation  can be understood  as a top-down  modulation  of attention.  According  \\nto Lutz et al. (2008),  two categories  of meditation  styles  can be classified,  depending  on the focus  \\nof attention:  open  monitoring  (OM)  meditation  and focused  attention  (FA)  meditation.  In OM \\nmeditation,  a process  of attention  monitoring  is maintained  without  focusing  on a particular  \\nthought  or object.  During  FA meditation,  attention  is directed  towards  a particular  object,  thought  \\nor proce ss. These  categories  do not represent  mutually  exclusive  processes  but may be \\ndifferentially  engaged  during  long-term meditation  or even  during  a single  meditation  session  \\n(Lutz  et al., 2008;  Travis  and Shear,  2010).  Within  the ancient  tradition  of Zen meditation,  “the \\nmain  aim […] is to remain  constantly  aware  of what  is occurring  in the present  moment  to keep \\nthe mind  in the specific  state in which  the experiential  insight  (satori)  can arise” (Chiesa  and \\nMalinowski,  2011).  This is related  to the concept  of mindfulness,  often  described  as a state of non-\\njudgmental  awareness  towards  the present  moment  (Kabat -Zinn,  2006)  that is maintained  by a \\nprocess  of attention  monitoring  practiced  during  OM meditation.  However,  during  Zen meditation  \\nFA processes  also occur (e.g. Travis  & Shear,  2010).  Independent  of the differences  between  \\nmeditation  styles,  they all lead to a putatively  altered  awareness  state.  There  is, therefore,  growing  \\ninterest  in meditation,  particularly  within  the fields  of attention  and consciousn ess research  (for \\nreviews,  see Fell et al., 2010;  Lutz et al., 2008;  Tassi  & Muzet,  2001).  \\nAs early  as 1966,  a study  by Kasamatsu  and Hirai  looked  into electroencephalographic  (EEG)  \\nchanges  during  Zen meditation.  The authors  reported  alpha  waves  during  meditation  (although  \\nsubjects‟ eyes were  open)  that increased  in amplitude  and decreased  in frequency  with progression  \\nof the meditation  session.  During  the latter  part of the meditation  session,  theta  rhythms  appeared  \\nmainly  in meditators  with many  years  of experience.  Other  studies  found  similar  alpha  and theta  \\neffects  during  meditation  (Novices  in Zen meditation  practice:  Kubota  et al., 2001;  Takahashi  et ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 3}\n",
            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n4 al., 2005).  Reductions  in beta band  power  have  also been  reported  (FA meditation:  Saggar  et al., \\n2012;  FA and OM meditation:  Hinterberger  et al., 2014)  and suggested  to be related  to minimal  \\nself-awareness  and selflessness  (Dor -Ziderman  et al., 2013).  Influences  of Zen meditation  have  \\nalso been  demonstrated  using  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (fMRI) , showing  increased  \\nblood  oxygen  level -dependent  (BOLD)  response  in the areas  of the default  mode  network  in Zen \\npractitioners,  including  the right  insula,  during  conceptual  processing  (Pagnoni  et al., 2008).  \\nAn impressive  illustration  of the neural  impact  of meditation  can be seen in structural  differences:  \\nfor example,  cortical  thickness  was increased  for Zen meditators,  including  in pain related  regions  \\n(Grant  et al., 2010),  while  age-related  loss of gray matter  was reduced  (Pagnoni  and Cekic,  2007).  \\nIn other  forms  of mindfulness  meditation,  larger  hippocampal  volumes  (Luders  et al., 2009;  \\nLuders  et al., 2013b)  were  found  in long-term meditators,  and increased  gray matter  density  \\n(Hölzel et al., 2011;  Leung  et al., 2013;  Luders  et al., 2013a)  and cortical  thickness  (Kang  et al., \\n2013;  Lazar  et al., 2005)  were  found  in a number  of regions  including  the right  insula,  left inferior  \\ntemporal  gyrus,  right  thalamus,  hippocampus  and the cerebellum.  Further,  differences  in white  \\nmatter  have  also been  reported  after short -term meditation  training  compared  to before  training  \\n(Tang  et al., 2010;  Tang  et al., 2012)  as well as for long-term meditators  compared  to control  \\nparticipants  (Kang  et al., 2013).  For long-term mindfulness  meditators  compared  to control  \\nparticipants, abnormal  cerebral  metabolism  (Fayed  et al., 2013)  and enhanced  structural  \\nconnectivity  have  been  shown  (Luders  et al., 2011).  These  structural  differences  are likely  related  \\nto differences  in functional  connectivity  that can be measured  during  resting  state in meditators  \\n(e.g. fMRI:  FA: Hasenkamp  & Barsalou,  2012;  short -term integrative  body -mind  training:  Xue et \\nal., 2011),  which  presumably  are a consequence  of specific  patterns  of neuronal  activity  during  \\nintensive  meditation  training  (e.g. Lehmann  et al., 2012;  EEG  study  on FA: Saggar  et al., 2012).  \\nLehman  and colleagues  (2012)  investigated  five different  meditation  techniques  and reported  \\nreduced  EEG  connectivity  for Zen meditation,  mainly  in alpha  and beta frequencies  when  ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 4}\n",
            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n5 compared  to (initial  and final)  rest. Another  study  found  increased  alpha  coherence  during  Zen \\nmeditation  in novices  (Murata  et al., 2004).  For short -term integrative  mind -body  training,  \\nchanges  in EEG  theta  band  networks  have  been  observed,  in particular,  smaller  average  path \\nlength and larger  global  clustering  coefficients  have  been  reported  and interpreted  as enhanced  \\nlocal  specialization  (Xue  et al., 2014).  However,  the available  evidence  is inconsistent,  with some  \\nstudies  reporting  increases  in functional  EEG  connectivity  (Transcendental  meditation:  Hebert  et \\nal., 2005;  Travis  et al., 2010;  Zen novices:  Murata  et al., 2004),  and some  reporting  decreases  \\n(different  meditation  techniques  including  Zen: Lehmann  et al., 2001;  different  techniques,  \\ngamma  band:  Faber  et al., 2004;  mindfulness -meditation:  Berkovich -Ohana  et al., 2013),  and \\nothers  showing  local  specialization  (Xue  et al., 2014).  This topic,  therefore,  requires  further  \\ninvestigation.   \\nGenerally,  meditation  and attentional  processes  have  a close  relationship  that is evide nt in \\ndescriptions  of various  meditation  techniques  (e.g. OM vs. FA), and is further  supported  by \\nseveral  studies  showing  that meditation  training  improves  performance  in tasks  involving  attention  \\n(Hodgins  & Adair,  2010;  Slagter  et al., 2007;  van Leeuwen  et al., 2009).  On a neuronal  level,  \\nattentional  processing  has been  closely  linked  to increased  high-frequency  oscillatory  activity  \\n(Gregoriou  et al., 2009;  Lachaux  et al., 2005).  For example,  studies  have  suggested  that high-\\nfrequency  gamma  oscillations  (> 50 Hz) represent  attentional  mechanisms  of visual  processing  \\nand working  memory  (Jensen  et al., 2007;  Jokisch  & Jensen,  2007).  \\nIn the field of meditation,  recent  research  indicates  a role of lower  gamma  activity  in processes  \\ninvolved  in various  meditation  states  and techniques  (Berkovich -Ohana  et al., 2012,  2013;  Cahn  et \\nal., 2013;  Hinterberger  et al., 2014;  Lehmann  et al., 2001;  for a review  see: Cahn  & Polich,  2006;  \\nFell et al., 2010;  Lutz et al., 2004).  However,  high-frequency  gamma  was not investigated  in these  \\nstudies  and, therefore,  it remains  unclear  whether  modulations  in high-frequency  gamma  activity  ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 5}\n",
            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n6 can also be found  during meditation,  as suggested  by the relationship  between  meditation  and \\nattention  described  above.   \\nIn the present  EEG  experiment,  we recorded  ongoing  EEG  activity  during  rest and seated  Zen \\nmeditation  (known  as Zazen),  and behavioral  scores  for mindfulness  and meditation  experience.  \\nZazen  means  sitting  in the position  of Buddha,  concentrated  on the body,  the breathing,  and to be \\nopen  to the very moment . We expected  meditation  experience  to be positively  correlated  with \\nmindfulness  ratings.  Concerning  the EEG data,  we took a novel  methodological  approach  \\ncompared  to other  studies,  as we analyzed  not only sensor  and source  data but also graph  \\ntheoretical  measures  and did it for a -compared  to present  standards - very broad  range  of \\nfrequencies  (2-245 Hz). Altho ugh we analyze d the differences  between  meditation  and non-\\nmeditation  rest, our major  interest  concerned  the further  elucidat ion of the relationship  of all these  \\nmeasures  with scores  of mindfulness  in daily  life and practical  experience.  Based  on previous  \\nfindings  of meditation -related  modulations  (either  between  meditation  and non-meditation  or \\nexperts  and novices)  within  various  frequency  bands,  we expected  general  effects  of meditation  on \\nas well as correlations  of meditation -relevant  parameters  (mindfulness  and practical  experience  \\nratings)  with EEG  activity  without  priori  restrictions  concerning  frequency  bands.  Beyond  this \\nlocal  level  of investigation,  we scrutinized  how meditation  practice  influences  the functional  \\nnetwork  architecture.  We computed  graph  theoretical  measures  (see Bullmore  and Sporns,  2009)  \\nat the level  of generators.  Based  on the research  cited  above,  we expected  to find differences  in \\nconnectivity  and network  properties  during  meditation  compared  to non-meditation  rest. Further  \\nwe tested  the role of mindfulness  in daily  life on meditation -driven  brain  network  modulation  by \\ncalculating  correlations  between  mindful ness scores  and global  graph  theoretical  measures  for all \\nfrequencies.  Overall,  our study  reveals  dramatic  changes  in ongoing  oscillatory  activity  as well as \\nconnectivity  patterns  that appear  to be sensitive  to the psychological  state changes  induced  by Zen \\nmeditation  that are particularly  related  to mindfulness .

Eleven  Zen meditators  with various  \\nlevels  of experience  took part in the experiment  (six female,  five male;  mean  age 50 years).  They  \\nwere  recruited  from  a local  Zen meditation  community.  The average  Zen meditation  experience  \\nwas 3418  hours  or twelve  years,  ranging  from four weeks  to 25 years.  The summed  number  of \\nhours  of meditation  experience  over the years  was used as data for practical  meditation  \\nexperience.  With  the exception  of one person,  all subjects  were  free of neurological  and \\npsychiatric  diseases,  and all were free of drug and medication  use. Omitting  this subject  from  the \\nstatistical  analysis  had no impact  on the reported  effects.  Thus  the results  described  here use the \\nentire  sample.  Subjects  received  25 Euros  for their participation.  All subjects  signed  an informed  \\nconsent  form  prior  to the experiment.

The MAAS  is a one-dimensional,  15-item scale  measuring  mindfulness,  \\nattention  and awareness  in the present  moment  on a six-point  Likert  scale.  Statements  such as “I \\nrush through  activities  without  really paying  attention  to them” were  rated  from  1 (almost  never)  \\nto 6 (almost  always).  For later interpretation,  this means  that lower  scores  reflect  higher  levels  of \\nmindfulness.  Other  related  constructs  such as acceptance  or empathy  were  omitted  (Brown  & \\nRyan, 2003).  Meditation  experience  was also assessed  prior  to EEG  recording.  A total number  of \\nhours  of meditation  was calculated  for each subject.  For the main  experiment,  EEG  data were  \\nrecorded  during  meditation  and non-meditation  rest, respectively.  The experiment  took place  in a \\ndimly  lit, electromagnetically  shielded  room.  The EEG  cap was placed  on subjects‟ heads  and \\nelectrodes  were  filled  with electrolyte  gel. Impedance  for the electrodes  were  below  30 kΩ. \\nDuring  Zen meditation,  subjects  sat in their usual meditation  position  (i.e. half-lotus  seat with eyes \\nopen)  with a meditation  cushion  on the floor  and EEG  data were  collected  for 20 minutes.  During  \\nnon-meditation  rest, subjects  sat in a comfortable  chair  and were  instructed  to relax,  not to \\nmeditate,  to keep  their eyes open  and to minimize  eye movements.  EEG  data were  recorded  for \\nfive minutes.  Half of the subjects  began  the experiment  with the meditation  condition,  the other  \\nhalf started  with the non-meditation  rest condition.  Subjects  were  pseudoran domly  assigned  to \\nstart with one of the two conditions,  an important  consideration  given  that gamma  power  is still \\nhigh following  meditation  as opposed  to pre-meditation  (Lutz  et al., 2004).  By using  a balanced  \\ndesign,  we hoped  to control  for similar  carry -over effects.  Neither  practical  experience  (t(9)= \\n0.05951,  p = 0.9539)  nor MAAS  scores  differed  between  these  two groups  (t(9) = 0.215,  p = \\n0.8346).  \\n \\n2.3 Data  collection  \\nEEG  data were  recorded  using  a 128-channel  ANT  system  (Advanced  Neuro  Technology,  \\nEnschede,  Netherlands).

For this \\npurpose,  bipolar  electrodes  were  placed  on the right  trapezius.

The 20 minutes  of meditation  EEG  activity  were  \\nsubdivided  into intervals  of five minutes  (allowing  us to later normalize  the data with five minutes  \\nnon-meditation  rest).  Raw EEG  data of meditation  and non-meditati on rest were  epoched  into \\nsegments  of two seconds  and filtered  with a 1 Hz high-pass Butterworth  filter.  All segments  were  \\nvisually  inspected  and, in a first pass,  all data segments  containing  large  non-physiological  \\nartifacts  (e.g. channel  jumps)  were  rejected.  EEG  data were  downsampled  to 500 Hz. An \\nindependent  component  analysis  (ICA)  was performed  and components  were  visualized  as time \\nseries  and topographically  to identify  artifacts  from  eye movements  and heart  muscle  activity.  \\nComponents  containing  these artifacts  were  removed  for all four meditation  intervals  and the non-\\nmeditation  rest (on average  nine components  were  removed  per subject),  and the cleaned  raw data \\nwere  reconstructed.  Following  ICA correction,  a second  visual  artifact  detection  was performed  \\nand residual  segments  that still contained  artifacts  were  rejected.  On average,  this led to \\nmeditation  data of 204 seconds  (range  92-272 s, standard  deviation  SD: 49.9 s) and non-\\nmeditation  data of 174 seconds  (range:  86-272 s; SD: 60.2 s).

The \\nsame  correlation  analysis  with meditation  experience  in hours  also revealed  a significant  positive  \\ncluster  for high frequencies  (p = .036),  indicating  that a lot of experi ence goes along  with \\nincreased  gamma  power.

The correlation  analyses  with mindfulness  scores  yielded  a significant  positive  cluster  for \\nsmall  worldedness  (p = .033,  fig. 2B) during  meditation  between  160 and 170 Hz with a peak  at \\n165 Hz. This effect  was driven  by clustering  (positive  cluster;  p = .03, fig. 3C), while  no effect  \\nwas observed  for path length.  Density  showed  a trend  level  of a negative  cluster  (p = .0639)  (fig. \\n3B). These  positive  clusters  indicate  that at these  frequencies  – which  are below  the mediation  \\nversus  rest effect  (see above)  - during  meditation  low levels  of mindfulness  (reflected  by high \\nscores)  result  in more  clustered  functional  network  architectures.  \\nConcerning  the general  difference  of global  graph  theoretical  measures  during  meditation  and \\nnon-meditation  rest, no effect  was found  for in the low-frequency  range.  In the high-frequency  \\nrange,  we obtained  a significant  negative  cluster  for density  (p = 0.005)  between  195 and 215 Hz \\n(suppl . fig, S1B), meaning  that meditation  overall  went  along  with disconnections  at these  high \\nfrequencies.  Furthermore,  a positive  cluster  was obtained  for small  worldedness  (p = .017,  suppl.  \\nfig, S1B) between  200 and 210 Hz. This effect  was again  driven  by clustering  (positive  cluster ; p \\n= .015,  suppl.  fig.

Thus,  the available  EMG  data from  the neck  electrode  does not provide  any \\nevidence  that the effects  found  in the high gamma  EEG  are muscular  artifacts.   \\n4 Discussion  \\nIn the present  study,  source -level  oscillatory  activity  and network  properties  were  investigated  in \\nZen meditators  during  meditation  and rest with a special  focus  on their relationship  with self-\\nreported  mindfulness .

On a behavioral  level,  we found  a significant  \\ncorrelation  between  MAAS  scores  and Zen meditation  experience,  suggesting  a developm ent of \\nmindfulness  skills  with meditation  experience.  More importantly  and interestingly , we uncovered  \\na thus far unreported  significant  correlation  between  high gamma  source  power  (starting  around  \\n30 Hz, plateau  from  100-245 Hz) and MAAS  scores  (and to a lesser  extent  practice  experience).  \\nSource  analysis  suggested  the involvement  of several  cortical  and subcortical  regions,  including  \\nsomatosensory  cortices  (BA 1,3), anterior  cingulate,  cuneus,  middle  and medial  frontal  region  as \\nwell as parahippocampus.  Thus, individuals  showing  high levels  of mindful  behavior  in their daily  \\nlives,  as measured  using  the MAAS,  also show  substantially  increased  high-frequency  gamma  \\npower  during  Zen meditation  in these  areas.  This effect  occurred  for normalized  power  data.  For \\nthe present  data,  we were  not able to disentangle  the contributions  of longitudinal  (non-meditation  \\nrest) versus  short -term (meditation  session)  changes  as the MAAS  scores  neither  correlated  \\nsignificantly  on a cluster  level  with non-meditation  rest nor non-normalized  meditation.  The lack \\nof correlations  with non-normalized  meditation  or non-meditation  rest might  be due to higher  \\ninter-individual  variability  for the single  conditions,  which  becomes  reduced  via normalization.  \\nHowever,  we speculate  that in general  both trait and state differences  play a role in meditation  as \\none (state)  is most  probably  a prerequisite  for the other  (trait)  to develop.  This assumption  is \\nsupported  by studies  showing  relevant  modulations  in brain  activity  during  both meditation  (e.g. \\nBerkovich -Ohana  et al., 2013)  and non-meditation  rest (e.g. sleep:  Ferrarelli  et al., 2013).  \\nThe general  relevance  of high gamma,  especially  regarding  these  structures,  is further  supported  \\nby the finding  that synchrony  in the high frequency  range  plays a role in synaptic  plasticity  \\n(Wespatat  et al., 2004) , suggesting  that structural  changes  may be connected  to high-frequency  \\noscillations  in the human  brain.  This is consistent  with previous  findings  from  longitudinal  fMRI  \\nstudies  that showed  increase d cortical  thickness  for meditators  in these  regions  of interest  (Grant  et ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 20}\n",

However,  in these  studies  sitting  was compared  to standing  (Kantak  et al., 2013)  or supine  \\nposture  (Muelhan  et al., 2014)  while  in our study  conditions  were  more  similar:  participants  were  \\nin sitting  posture  in both conditions,  although  they sat in the lotus  position  during  meditation  and \\nin a comfortable  chair  during  resting  condition.  This difference  in body  posture  was necessary  as \\ndiscussions  with Zen meditators  preceding  the study  made  it clear  that in particula r for \\nexperienced  meditators  it would  not be feasible  to sit in the lotus  position  without  meditating.  \\nGiven  these  differences  in body  posture  it is theoretically  possible  that muscular  artifacts  affected  \\nour data,  but there  are several  reasons  why we are confident  that this is not the case:  First,  we \\nrecorded  EMG  from  the neck  muscle  and analyzed  the data analogous  to the EEG  data to rule out \\npossib le contamination  from the neck  muscles.  Although  we did find significant  effects  of \\nmuscular  activity  during  normalized  meditation,  both in the lower  frequencies  and high gamma  \\nrange,  as well as a correlation  between  MAAS  scores  and non-normalized  meditation,  these  \\neffects  are unlikely  to explain  our EEG  findings:  all of the EMG  effects  were  either  completely  \\nabsent  in the EEG  data or were  in the opposite  direction  and therefore  have  no apparent  value  in \\naccounting  for the EEG  data.  Second,  related  to the first point,  muscular  artifacts  usually  show  an \\nincrease  in high broadband  gamma  activity.  In the present  study  it might  be expected  that the lotus  \\nposition  during  meditation  is more  physically  demanding  for novice  meditators  than long-term \\nmeditators.  Therefore  high gamma  would be expected  to correlate  negatively  with practice  \\nexperience  which  (at least for the neck  muscle)  was not the case,  but rather  the opposite,  meaning  \\nthat a lot of experience  goes along  with increased  high gamma  power.  Third,  the differences  \\nbetween  the two body  postures  also include  the lower  limbs  which  are, due to their extreme  ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 21}\n",

Fourth,  further  candidates  for \\nmuscular  artifacts  are head  and face muscles  which  are reported  to be broadband,  with e.g. peaks  \\naround  50-60 Hz for chewing  and 30-40 Hz for brow  wrinkling.  Compared  to this range  our main  \\npower  correlation  effects  are a lot higher,  with increase d power  from  30 to 245 Hz with a plateau  \\nbetween  100 and 245 Hz. Neck  muscles  are reported  to produce  a peak  frequency  around  100 Hz, \\nbut this was already  ruled out as a contaminating  source  as described  earlier  (see \\nMuthukumaraswamy,  2013  for a detailed  overview  of peak  frequencies  of muscular  artifacts ). \\nFifth,  the position  change  was the same  for all participants,  making  it less likely  that our \\ncorrelation  effects  with mindfulness  scores  / practical  experience  are confounded.  \\nWhile  the modulation  of low gamma  through  meditation  has already  been  reported  (Berkovich -\\nOhana  et al., 2012,  2013;  Hinterberger  et al., 2014;  Lutz et al., 2004) , the modulation  of high \\ngamma  has not yet been  investigated.  However,  within  the field of attention,  studies  support  the \\nnotion  that high gamma  (> 80 Hz) is associated  with attentive  processing  (e.g.  Brovelli  et al., \\n2005;  Gregoriou  et al., 2009;  Ray et al., 2008) . For example,  using intracranial  recordings,  \\nattention -dependent  modulations  of high gamma  were  shown  in modality -specific  sensory  regions  \\n(e.g. somatosensory)  and frontal  (Ray  et al., 2008)  and premotor  areas  (Brovelli  et al., 2005).  \\nIn general,  the connection  between  meditation  training  and attentional  performance  is well \\nestablished.  Assuming  that meditation  training  improves  attentional  processing  as well as \\nmindfulness  and given  that our participants  showed  some  distribution  of MAAS  scores  and \\npractical  experience,  it does not come  as a surprise  that instead  of a general  condition  difference  in \\nhigh gamma  we found  correlations  with MAAS  scores  as well as practical  experience.  However,  it \\nseems  essential  to mention  that the correlation  of gamma  power  with the MAAS  score  cannot  \\nsimply  be explained  by the amount  of meditation  experience  per se, as this correlation  was not ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 22}\n",

Instead,  this correlation  is based  on a \\nrelationship  with the quality  of the mental  state achieve d using  meditation,  namely  mindfulness  \\nskills.  Although  our findings  are supported  by other  studies  that have  shown  a link between  high \\ngamma  and attention  as well as awareness,  it has never  been  directly  shown  that increased  high-\\nfrequency  gamma  power  during the meditative  state is related  to measures  of mindfulness.  Future  \\nresearch  should  attempt  to confirm  these  findings  and investigate  mechanisms  of attention  \\ninvolved  in OM meditation,  which  may be closely  linked  to these  patterns  of neuronal  activity.   \\nAlthough  we stress  the findings  of correlations  between  MAAS  scores  and high gamma  \\nfrequencies,  we want  to point  out that also for the lower  gamma  frequencies  (<80  Hz) these  \\ncorrelations  showed  significant  results.  As mentioned  earlier,  modulations  in low gamma  during  \\nmeditation  of long-term meditators  were  already  reported  in previous  studies  (Berkovich -Ohana  et \\nal., 2012,  2013;  Chan  et al., 2010;  Hinterberger  et al., 2014;  Lutz et al., 2004).  For example,  Lutz \\nand colleagues  (2004)  found  that long-term meditators  show  an increase  in lower  gamma  power  \\nduring  meditation  compared  to rest which  is absent  in control  participants.  In the present  study  we \\ndid not find such a difference  which  might  be due to the fact (i) that we did not include  a control  \\ngroup  and (ii) that our group  of meditators  had a very wide  range  of experience.  However,  similar  \\nto what  we found,  namely  positive  correlations  with self-reported  mindfulness  (negative  \\ncorrelations  with MAAS  scores)  and practical  experience,  other  studies  as well found  stronger  \\n(low)  gamma  increase s for the more  experienced  meditators  (Cahn  et al., 2010;  Lutz et al. 2004) .  \\nFurthermore,  analyzing  general  differences  between  meditation  and non-meditation  rest, we found  \\nreduced  power  between  2 and 30 Hz with peaks  in the theta  (3 Hz) and beta band  (17 Hz) during  \\nmeditation.  Meditation -related  theta  band  (Hinterberger  et al., 2014)  and beta band  reductions,  \\nmainly  in fronto central  electrodes  have  also been  reporte d in previous  studies  (FA meditation,  \\nSaggar  et al., 2012;  FA and OM meditation,  Hinterberger  et al., 2014)  and related  to minimal  self-\\nawareness  and selflessness  during  meditation  (Dor -Ziderman  et al., 2013).

            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n24 participants  showed  a wide  range  of variability  therefore  these  findings  should  be interpreted  \\ncarefully.  Nevertheless,  the effect s were  localized  in various  regions  that have  also been  reported  \\nas playing  a role in bodily  awareness,  the processing  of body  sensations,  and interoceptive  \\nawareness  (Ott et al., 2011)  and show  structural  differences  in meditators  (Grant  et al., 2010;  \\nLazar  et al., 2005;  Luders  et al., 2012).  \\n \\nSince  meditation  seems  to remarkably  alter patterns  of brain  activity  both during  meditation  and in \\nthe long term,  functional  connectivity  is also likely  to change  in the meditative  state.  However,  \\nrecent  research  is inconsistent  as some  EEG  data show  decreased  global  functional  connectivity  \\nmainly  in alpha  and beta bands  during  meditation  (Faber  et al., 2004;  Lehmann  et al., 2012)  and \\nothers  show  increased  global  clustering  (Xue  et al., 2014).  Additionally,  increased  connectivity  \\nwas found  in EEG  (Murata  et al., 2004)  and fMRI  research  (Kilpatrick  et al., 2011;  Xue et al., \\n2011).  In the present  study,  we investigated  connectivity  using  global  and local  graph  theoretical  \\nmeasures  over a broad  range  of oscillatory  frequencies  and their relationship  with mindfulness.   \\nRemarkably,  we found  that functional  connectivity  and network  properties  between  160 and 170 \\nHz are correlated  with individual  ratings  of mindfulness,  attention  and awareness.  For this \\nfrequency  range,  it appears  that the less mindful  a person  is (indicate d by high MAAS  scores)  the \\nstronger  the disconnection  (represented  by a negative  correlational  trend  for density)  but also the \\nstronger  the small  worldedness  (positive  correlation).  The effect  of small  worldedness  can \\ngenerally  be driven  by changes  in clustering  or path length  of a network  (each  normalized  by \\nanalogous  measures  derived  from  random  networks  with the same  amount  of nodes  and edges).  \\nOur data shows  unambiguously  that the effect  was driven  by clustering  that also showed  a positive  \\ncorrelation  with MAAS  scores,  while  no correlation  occurred  for path length.  This suggests  that \\nmeditation  shapes  brain  activity  in such a way that on a global  level  it is less functionally  \\nconnected  and more  modular  (clustered)  for persons  with low mindfulness  scores  and vice versa  ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 24}\n",
            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n25 for persons  with high mindfulness  scores.  In other  words , the correlations  indicate  that stronger  \\neffects  are mainly  carried  by those  meditators  that show  higher  scores  of the MAAS  and might  not \\nhave  reached  an „expert‟ level  yet, assuming  that higher  mindfulness  is one relevant  criterion  of \\nmeditation  expertise  regardless  of whether  it might  precede  or follow  practical  meditation  \\nexperience.  Interestingly,  calculating  the sources  of correlations  betwe en MAAS  and local  graph  \\ntheoretical  measures  revealed  that there  were  some  sources  in which  both positive  correlations  of \\nMAAS  and local  clustering  and negative  correlations  of MAAS  and degrees  occurred  (mainly  in \\nbilateral  thalamus  and bilateral  cingulate  gyrus ). The co-occurrence  of both effects  indicates  that \\nin less mindful  persons  it is mainly  the long-range  connections  that suffer  a decrease,  while  the \\ncommunication  to the immediate  neighbors  is undisturbed  and even  enhanced.  It has been  \\nsuggested  that connectivity  between  the thalamus  and paralimbic  structures  in the gamma  band  \\n(30-100 Hz) is a crucial  ingredient  for self-awareness  (Lou  et al., 2010).  Given  our results,  this \\nmight  indicate  that the less „expert‟ a meditator  is (as measured  by MAAS  scores, again  assuming  \\nthat mindfulness  is one characteristic  of meditation  expertise)  the more  additional  effort  (reflected  \\nby the correlations  of connectivity/graph  measures  with MAAS  scores  between  160-170 Hz) is \\nrequired  during  meditation  to presumably  reach an altered  state awareness  which  most  likely  is \\ndue to altered  connectivity  and network  properties .  \\nAnalogous  processes  can be seen during  development  and learning  when  a synaptic  increase  \\ninitially  occurs  that is then followed  by neural  pruning   (see Bruer,  1999,  for a review).  Thus,  this \\npositive  correlation  between  MAAS  scores  and density  and clustering  measures  may represent  the \\nprocess  of specialization  during  long-term meditation.   \\nThe level  of expertise  (indicated  by MAAS  scores)  however  apparen tly does not play a role for the \\ngeneral  condition  as evidenced  by the missing  correlation  for the frequency  range  between  200 \\nand 210 Hz for which  the general  condition  effect s were  found.  Significant  disconnection  of brain  \\nactivity  during  meditation,  evident  as decreased  density,  in the high gamma  frequency  range  (200-' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 25}\n",
            "page_content='ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\\n26 210 Hz) occurred.  This global  effect  was likely  driven  by pronounced  reductions  of degrees  \\nmainly  in the right  insula,  right  parahippocampal  gyrus,  the anterior  cingulate  and the caudate  as \\nwell as the cerebellum.  These  findings  are in line with other  studies  reporting  reduced  connectivity  \\nduring  Zen or mindfulness -meditation,  although  those  studies  did not analyze  high gamma  and \\nonly report  significant  results  for low gamma  (e.g. Berkovic h-Ohana  et al., 2013;  Faber  et al., \\n2004;  Lehmann  et al., 2012).   \\nWe further  found  increased  small  worldedness  during  meditation  as compared  to non-meditation  \\nrest. This effect  was driven  by significantly  increased  clustering  while  no changes  occurred  in path \\nlength  during  meditation,  compared  to non-meditation  rest. This suggests  that even  though  during  \\nmeditation  the brain  is less functionally  connected  it at the same  time exhibits  a more  clustered  \\norganization . Interestingly,  increased  local  clustering  co-occurred  with reduced  degrees  for the \\nrelevant  frequencies  (200-210 Hz) mainly  in parts  of the insula,  cingulate  gyrus  and the caudate  \\nsuggesting  that for these  structures  the long-range  connections  are affect ed while  communication  \\nwith nearby  nodes  is enhanced.  \\nTaken  together,  these  findings  suggest  that Zen meditation  is a highly  active,  energy -consuming  \\nstate of mind.  While  mindfulness  as a trait may strengthen  and develop  together  with practical  \\nexperience,  the pattern  of neuronal  activity  changes  during  the state of meditation  itself.  More  \\nspecifically,  the source  power  of low frequencies  seems  to be reduced,  indicating  that the brain  \\nshifts  into another  mental  state,  including,  for example,  altered  self-awareness  (Dor -Ziderman  et \\nal., 2013)  as one begins  to meditate.  The present  study  adds significant  insights  to the current  \\nmeditation  literature,  which  has primarily  focused  on low gamma  effects,  by showing  a strong  \\nrelationship  between  high-frequency  gamma  power  and practitioners ‟ mindfulness  ratings.  This \\nprominent  effect  could  be localized  in multiple  brain  regions  involved  in self-processing  and body  \\nawareness,  suggesting  that meditators  effectively  train self-awareness  and mindfulness.  This is not \\nonly reflected  in subjective  reports  (MAAS),  but also in specific  brain  activity.  Beyond  that, we ' metadata={'source': '/content/studies/hauswald 2015.pdf', 'page': 26}\n",
