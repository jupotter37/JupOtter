Within accumulated sludge there is an anaerobic zone in which bacteria can grow. Anaerobic bacteria can produce methane, which bubbles out of the sedimentation tank. These bubbles take sediment/flocs with them up through the sed tank. The sediment/flocs then escape through the exit launder, which causes poor performance.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","1. Why is it important to be able to send poorly flocculated water to waste BEFORE it enters the sedimentation tank?    \n","    1.  Poorly flocculated water contains very small diameter flocs which are the ones that tend to escape a sedimentation tank and continue on to the filters. By wasting poorly flocculated water, we are removing the small flocs that are more likely to make it through the entire treatment plant. Purging poorly flocculated water thereby decreases the plant's effluent turbidity. \n","    \n","    Additionally, a sedimentation tank with poorly flocculated water will continue to release small flocs for up to multiple residence times (since the sed tank has properties of a CSTR). This means that you will have poor quality-sedimented effluent for a significant amount of time after the flocculator performance has stabilized.
