    "> There are some significant flaws in the files resulting from these scripts that make the data fairly unusable. Since titles and artists mix quotes and include commas, columns are not parsed correctly. This could possible be fixed in the script, or after the fact, but I don't have it in me to figure it out.\n",

    "Idea of this notebook is to build an archive of the Hot 100 from the the current date to the oldest date __1958-08-02__. It's currently set up to pull a year's worth. The idea is to stack them later. (I started doing it by year after hitting the timeouts listed above, just in case it was a reading error locally on a large file. The doesn't appear to be the case.)\n",

    "There is a rate limit on requests to the billboard site. I've had it time out after 10 requests, but I've also had it time out after one if I've run other requests recently.\n",

    "For each chart, we have `chart.previousDate` to work with, which allows us to walk back in time. The loop works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open our file\n",
    "- check for the oldest date, start new if not results already\n",
    "- Find the next oldest chart\n",
    "- Start a loop and counter and write the results of that week's chart\n",
    "- Set the chart date to the next oldest date\n",
    "- Check if that is in our current year. Break if not.\n",
    "- Wait a time interval and loop again if counter is not maxed\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't completely solve the rate limit, but does pretty well at 10 seconds a week.\n"
