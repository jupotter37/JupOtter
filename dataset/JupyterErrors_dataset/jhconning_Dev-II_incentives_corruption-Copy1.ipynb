    "Many public policy issues in developing countries be understood and modeled as asymmetric information problems where Principal - Monitor - Agent contract structures must be employed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for example a central government that launches a project either to improve rural roads (as in Olken, 2007) or perhaps instead a project to carry out a campaign to distribute anti-malaria mosquito nets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For either type of project the government will make funds available to local communities across the country but must rely on local agents (e.g. local contractors or officials) to implement the projects.  The government may have a very good idea of how much it costs to repair a kilometer or make and distribute 1000 mosquito nets but typically cannot monitor whether the local agents 'diligently' carry out the project to specification or not.  The government will in the end see if the project has succeeded or failed, and the project is much more likely to succeed if the local contractor has carried out the contract to specification, but the government cannot directly verify whether this has been the case or not.  This moral hazard situation means that the government can only put local agents on outcome-contingent and not action-contingent contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example after the local road repair project is completed the government will be able to see if the project succeeded (e.g. the bridge was not washed away this year when the river floods) or whether it failed (it did not wash away).  But the government can not directly observe the agent's level of diligence in the project -- for example whether they built the bridge to specification with the allocated funds or if they perhaps substituted shoddier building materials to divert funds to private gain) because the project's outcome is probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly in an anti-malarial campaign the local agent might claim to have made and distributed 1000 mosquito nets but in fact it only made and distributed 500.  All the government can do is observe whether the number of malaria cases has been reduced (success) or increased or stayed the same compared to earlier years. "

Many problems of fiscal federalism with Central, State and Local goverments can also be modeled this way.\n",

For example if the intermediary is monitoring two agents on projects with independent projects it may be cheaper to pay zero or low compensation to the intermediary when either or both projects fails but a healthy bonus if they both succeed, then to structure the two renumeration projects separately.\n",

For example suppose that we had two projects and two agents and we engaged each agent to work on their own project (say builing bridges as described above) and also as a monitor of the other agent.  The challenge is to then design a contract that then induces the two agents to choose effort on their bridge building and monitoring of the other agent strategically.  This can be solved as a mechanism design problem: the principal determines the terms of a joint liability contract implement the desired levels of monitoring and project effort as the solution to a Nash-game played between the agents, guarding against the possibility that the agents might collude with each other against the principal. \n",
