[/INST] I would suggest that you try to get to bed at a reasonable time and try to get up at the same time every day.  I would also suggest that you try to avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed.  If you are still having trouble sleeping, I would suggest that you see a doctor.  They can help you determine if there is an underlying medical issue that is causing your insomnia.  Good luck!  Robin J.
