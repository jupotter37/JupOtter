If your search space is finite, then Depth-First Search is complete. However, if there are infinitely many alternatives, it might not find a solution. For example, suppose you were coding a path-search problem on city streets, and every time you turn left at an intersection, you will always search the left-most street first. Then you might just keep going around the same block indefinitely.\n","\n","Sometimes there are ways to bound the search to get completeness even when the search space is unbounded. For example, for the path-search problem above, if we prune the search whenever a path returns to a previous location on the path, then DFS will always find a solution if one exists.\n","\n","There are variants of DFS that are complete. One is iterative deepening: you set a maximum search depth for DFS, and only search that far down the search tree. If you donâ€™t find a solution, then you increase the bound and try again.
