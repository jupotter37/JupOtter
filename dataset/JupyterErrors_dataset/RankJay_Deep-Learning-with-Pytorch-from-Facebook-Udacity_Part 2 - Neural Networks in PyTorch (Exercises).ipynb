to build a simple network for this dataset using weight matrices and matrix multiplications. Then, we'll see how to do it using PyTorch's `nn` module which provides a much more convenient and powerful method for defining network architectures.\n","\n","The networks you've seen so far are called *fully-connected* or *dense* networks. Each unit in one layer is connected to each unit in the next layer. In fully-connected networks, the input to each layer must be a one-dimensional vector (which can be stacked into a 2D tensor as a batch of multiple examples). However, our images are 28x28 2D tensors, so we need to convert them into 1D vectors. Thinking about sizes, we need to convert the batch of images with shape `(64, 1, 28, 28)` to a have a shape of `(64, 784)`, 784 is 28 times 28. This is typically called *flattening*, we flattened the 2D images into 1D vectors.\n","\n","Previously you built a network with one output unit. Here we need 10 output units, one for each digit. We want our network to predict the digit shown in an image, so what we'll do is calculate probabilities that the image is of any one digit or class. This ends up being a discrete probability distribution over the classes (digits) that tells us the most likely class for the image. That means we need 10 output units for the 10 classes (digits). We'll see how to convert the network output into a probability distribution next.\n","\n","> **Exercise:** Flatten the batch of images `images`. Then build a multi-layer network with 784 input units, 256 hidden units, and 10 output units using random tensors for the weights and biases. For now, use a sigmoid activation for the hidden layer. Leave the output layer without an activation, we'll add one that gives us a probability distribution next."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iiMRXG8euPfd","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["## Your solution\n","def activation(x):\n","    return 1/(1+torch.exp(-x))\n","\n","# Flatten the input images\n","inputs = images.view(images.shape[0], -1)\n","\n","# Create parameters\n","w1 = torch.randn(784, 256)\n","b1 = torch.randn(256)\n","\n","w2 = torch.randn(256, 10)\n","b2 = torch.randn(10)\n","\n","h = activation(torch.mm(inputs, w1) + b1)\n","\n","out = torch.mm(h, w2) + b2\n","# output of your network, should have shape (64,10)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DK3BYCfIuPfg","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Now we have 10 outputs for our network.

Something that looks like this:\n","<img src='assets/image_distribution.png' width=500px>\n","\n","Here we see that the probability for each class is roughly the same. This is representing an untrained network, it hasn't seen any data yet so it just returns a uniform distribution with equal probabilities for each class.\n","\n","To calculate this probability distribution, we often use the [**softmax** function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function). Mathematically this looks like\n","\n","$$\n","\\Large \\sigma(x_i) = \\cfrac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_k^K{e^{x_k}}}\n","$$\n","\n","What this does is squish each input $x_i$ between 0 and 1 and normalizes the values to give you a proper probability distribution where the probabilites sum up to one.\n","\n","> **Exercise:** Implement a function `softmax` that performs the softmax calculation and returns probability distributions for each example in the batch. Note that you'll need to pay attention to the shapes when doing this. If you have a tensor `a` with shape `(64, 10)` and a tensor `b` with shape `(64,)`, doing `a/b` will give you an error because PyTorch will try to do the division across the columns (called broadcasting) but you'll get a size mismatch. The way to think about this is for each of the 64 examples, you only want to divide by one value, the sum in the denominator. So you need `b` to have a shape of `(64, 1)`. This way PyTorch will divide the 10 values in each row of `a` by the one value in each row of `b`. Pay attention to how you take the sum as well. You'll need to define the `dim` keyword in `torch.sum`. Setting `dim=0` takes the sum across the rows while `dim=1` takes the sum across the columns."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-20WQTRcuPfh","colab_type":"code","outputId":"4c92f61f-a903-40e1-8092-72fa4c34e637","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1579098662145,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4368,"user":{"displayName":"Jay Rank","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCwUW9xNWorZite80BIHikFJSrrsFyMmaNOn24b=s64","userId":"11703681941357829257"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":177}},"source":["def softmax(x):\n","    ## TODO: Implement the softmax function here\n","    ## Solution\n","    return torch.exp(x)/torch.sum(torch.exp(x), dim=1).view(-1, 1)\n","\n","# Here, out should be the output of the network in the previous excercise with shape (64,10)\n","probabilities = softmax(out)\n","\n","# Does it have the right shape?
