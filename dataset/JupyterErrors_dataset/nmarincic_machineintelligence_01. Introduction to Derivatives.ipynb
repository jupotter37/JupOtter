As we have no other information about our trip, the graph displaying distance over time is a straight line passing through the origin. The consequence of this linearity is that the average speed of 300 meters in 20 seconds is the same as the average speed of 150 meters in 10 seconds. Although both of these ratios are valid ways to describe speed, a different convention is usually used. We express this ratio as a __rate__, which means that the denominator of the ratio should be one unit of quantity. To express speed as a rate, we need to find the distance for which the time is 1s. So we divide 300 meters by 20 seconds and get that the average speed between A and B is 15 meters per (one) second or 15m/s. We can say that the average __rate of change__ of our ride is 15m/s. "

Also, a single point has no length, which is the same as zero length. So to find this so-called instantaneous speed, we would need to divide the distance by zero time, which mathematics does not allow us to do. On the other side, our intuition tells us that if we move, there should be a speed associated with our movement at any moment in time."

    "Before the 17th century, this paradox was unsurpassable in terms of computation. The tools mathematicians had at their disposal had not been sufficient to deal with this and similar paradoxes. However, in the mid 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz realised that there is a different way to think about paradoxes like this. They introduced a purely symbolical quantity which stands for something larger than zero but smaller than any number that you can concretely specify. They called in an __infinitesimal__. When running into problems that involve values that eventually end up leading to zero, one could use this symbolic quantity to represent them, thus bypass the paradox and the division by zero. The invention of this quantity has opened up new ways to think about modelling the world around us, and many of our fundamental concepts such is speed changed dramatically. Their study became known as __infinitesimal calculus__, and its methods allow us to address concepts such are instantaneous speed. It allows us to consider a change within a symbolically constructed virtual interval which is as close as possible to zero, but not zero. Calculus allows us to consider the idea of instantaneous speed as meaningful and operable."

Instead of using a specific point like 11.6 seconds we will use a variable $t$, meaning that $t$ will serve as a placeholder for _any_ value of time on our graph, and we can slide it left and right as we wish."

We could name this variable $s$ or use any other symbol, but let's call it $s(t)$ for two good reasons. The first is that $s(t)$ clearly indicates that the time and distance are coupled together. The second reason is that in mathematics $s(t)$ means that the distance is represented as a __function of time__, so that for each time value, there is a corresponding distance value. This representation allows us to use any function we wish to model the relation between distance and time, so we can now put aside our imaginary instruments that allowed us to capture the time and distance of our ride.

The expression written below the $\\lim$ (in our case $dt\\to 0$) tells us which variable in our expression will be approaching what value. In this way, the dynamic aspect of infinitesimal is taken away from the actual variable and become an instrument of the limit itself.
