Born and educated in Merida, Venezuela, Sanchez completed graduate degrees and postgraduate research at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste, Italy), Tufts University, and Harvard University. In 2012, Sanchez won the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers for her work with the US Department of Energys Argonne National Laboratory to make the technology of neutrino photodetectors more accessible and inexpensive. Such developments would create opportunities for major progress in medical imaging and other applications. According to a press release from Iowa State, Sanchez is \"currently affiliated with the proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment, which would send the world’s most intense beam of neutrinos from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., to the Homestake Mine in Lead, S.D. She is also working on the MINOS and NOvA experiments designed to study neutrinos sent from Fermilab to detectors in northern Minnesota. Sanchez has been working to apply the next generation of the photodetectors that spot Cherenkov light, the blue glow emitted when a charged particle passes through water and other transparent materials faster than light.\"\n",

      "Abstract: This paper serves the purpose of providing an example of someone who deviates from the typical white, European male physicist stereotype. Mae C. Jemison, her biography, and her contributions to physics as we know it are listed within the paper. Finally, this paper discusses where in Matter and Interactions Jemison and her work should be mentioned. I concluded that chapter 3 was the optimal place to include Mae C. Jemison.\n",
      "Main Body: A “Physics and STEM Heroes” Biography tells of Mae Jemison’s life: Mae Jemison was born on October 17, 1956, in Decatur, Alabama, the youngest child of Charlie Jemison, a roofer and carpenter, and Dorothy (Green) Jemison, an elementary school teacher. Mae attended secondary school at Morgan Park High School, and graduated in 1973 as a consistent honor student. Upon graduating, she attended Stanford University on a National Achievement Scholarship where she achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the university in 1977. Shortly after graduating, she entered Cornell University Medical College and obtained her medical doctor degree in 1981. She interned at Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center and later worked as a general practitioner. June 4, 1987, she became the first African-American woman to be admitted into the astronaut training program. After more than a year of training at NASA, she became the first African-American female astronaut, earning the title of science mission specialist. Mae flew into space on September 12, 1992, with six other astronauts aboard the Endeavour on mission; she became the first African-American woman in space. She left the astronaut corps in March 1993, and then accepted a teaching fellowship at Dartmouth. Mae also established The Dorothy Jemison Foundation, a company that seeks to research, develop and market advanced technologies. Research During her eight days in space, she conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on the crew and herself. In all, she spent more than 190 hours in space before returning to Earth on September 20, 1992. Following her historic flight, Jemison noted that society should recognize how much both women and members of other minority groups can contribute if given the opportunity.\n",
      "Placement in Textbook: Mae Jemison’s most known work is that of exploring and conducting experiments on weightlessness in space. Therefore, information about herself and about her experiments and findings would be best placed in Chapter 3 Lesson 3.2 of Matter and Interactions: The Gravitational Force. This lesson is the best place to include Mae Jemison because she focused on the lack of “normal” (earth’s surface force) gravitational force in outer space and the effects it had on humans. This information can give the reader an example of the application of calculating gravitational force.\n",

      "Ibn al-Haytham (c.965 - c.1040 AD), aka Alhazen, was a physicist as well as a mathematician and astronomer during the Islamic Golden Age. Alhazen is most known for his contributions to optics and the scientific method. Going against the emission theory of Euclid and Ptolemy and the intromission theory of Aristotle, Ibn al-Haytham theorized that we see objects because the eyes receive the rays of light that reflect off an object (Wikipedia). His most famous work, Kitāb al-manāẓir, described this phenomenon and included details about reflection and refraction. Ibn al-Haytham was keen on using experimentation and mathematical reasoning to support his theories (Lorch). Alhazen also had an understanding that to prove a hypothesis, one must perform experiments that have numerical evidence. Through this practice, he showed an understanding of the scientific method many centuries before it was established and popularized. In fact, his work was influential for Roger Bacon, the next stepping stone in the development of the scientific method (Britannica). In addition to sight and the scientific method, Alhazen investigated the rainbow, moonlight, celestial physics, motion of the body, and more (Wikipedia).\n",

The moon landings changed her focus from ballerina to becoming the first female astronaut and set her on her path to become an astrophysicist. She had two very important role models as a young girl; her mother that encouraged her at every step of the way and a high school chemistry teacher that made it all seem possible. Her undergraduate studies began in mathematics and shifted to physics during her early years at MIT. In 1987, Ms. Ghez graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a BS in Physics. From there she went on to get her PhD from the California Institute of Technology in 1992. While a doctoral student at Caltech, Ms. Ghez convinced her adviser to allow her to teach undergraduate courses in physics. Her argument was that there was a need for female role models in teaching that would encourage young women to pursue science degrees. She received the Caltech teaching award for her efforts an honor normally reserved for facility. In 1994, she joined the teaching staff at UCLA and is now the head of the UCLA Galactic Center Group. Research Description Ms. Ghez is known for her study of star formation and black holes. While studying as a doctoral student at Caltech, she discovered that most stars are formed in pairs and that most systems have two suns not just one like ours. Her fascination with black holes has been a focal point for her research. Working with a team at UCLA they have been able to use special optics to look into the center of the milky way galaxy and observe the invisible existence of black hole by seeing how they interact with the celestial objects around them. Ms. Ghez is currently working to test the theory of general relativity with relationship to black holes. According to the theory of general relativity, when a star comes in contact with large gravitational forces, it will not follow the laws of physics and begin to change it orbit. The gravitational forces produced by black holes changes the game because large gravitational forces are now massive. This could prove to be a challenge to this long held theory. In the near future, Ms. Ghez and her team hope to have an answer to this question.\n",

      "Biography John Dabiri was born in 1980 shortly after his parents immigrated to Toledo, Ohio from Nigeria in 1975. His father was a mechanical engineer and taught mathematics at a local community college. His mother was a computer scientist who started a software development company in addition to raising John and his two siblings. Dabiri’s passion for engineering started while watching his father do engineering work. John graduated high school in 1997 from a small Baptist high school where he graduated first in his class. He applied to only one school and was accepted there; Princeton. His early work and interest there involved rockets, jets and helicopter design. The summer after his junior year he did a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Aeronautics at Cal-Tech. One summer project involved how swimming jellyfish create vortices which started his work in biomechanics. Research John has many different areas of research but this section will focus on how he incorporated the hydrodynamics of jellyfish into the development of a vertical-axis wind farm. The wind energy industry is scaling up to harvest more energy. However, Dabiri believes that problems associated with large turbines (design difficulties, building costs, increasing areal needs (turbines are sometimes erected a mile apart to ensure good wind flow), eyesore complaints and accidental animal deaths) can be avoided through innovation.His center, with 24 close vertical axis turbines, is his step towards more economical harvesting of wind energy. Noting that there is constructive interference in the hydro-dynamic wakes of schooling fish, Dabiri suggested that extracting energy from flow vortices could aid more than locomotion.His models of the energy extraction mechanism are applicable to the design of systems like wind farms. Design of an array of vertical axis turbines led to about an order of magnitude increase in power output per area.Dabiri partnered with Windspire Energy for use of three of 24 turbines that stand approximately 30 feet tall by 4 feet wide.He started a company, Scalable Wind Solutions, to commercialize the software used to optimally place the turbines. This has also led to the Navy funding development of an underwater craft that propels on these concepts which needs 30% less energy.\n",

In the near future, Ghez and her team hope to have an answer to this question.\n",

      "Biography John Dabiri was born in 1980 shortly after his parents immigrated to Toledo, Ohio from Nigeria in 1975. His father was a mechanical engineer and taught mathematics at a local community college. His mother was a computer scientist who started a software development company in addition to raising John and his two siblings. Dabiri’s passion for engineering started while watching his father do engineering work. John graduated first in his class from a small Baptist high school 1997. He applied to only one school - Princeton -  and was accepted. His early work and interest there involved rockets, jets and helicopter design. The summer after his junior year he did a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Aeronautics at Cal-Tech. One summer project involved how swimming jellyfish create vortices which was the beginning of his work in biomechanics. He was also a finalist for both the Rhodes Scholarship and the Marshall Scholarship and has been awarded 8 different NSF research grants in 5 different fields. He is currently a professor at Stanford.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "Dabiri has many different areas of research but this section focuses on how he incorporated the hydrodynamics of jellyfish into the development of a vertical-axis wind farm. The wind energy industry is scaling up to harvest more energy. Dabiri believes that problems associated with large turbines (design difficulties, building costs, increasing areal needs, turbines are sometimes erected a mile apart to ensure good wind flow, eyesore complaints and accidental animal deaths) can be avoided through innovation.His center, with 24 close vertical axis turbines, is his step towards more economical harvesting of wind energy. Noting that there is constructive interference in the hydro-dynamic wakes of schooling fish, Dabiri suggested that extracting energy from flow vortices could aid more than locomotion.His models of the energy extraction mechanism are applicable to the design of systems like wind farms. Design of an array of vertical axis turbines led to about an order of magnitude increase in power output per area. Dabiri partnered with Windspire Energy for use of three of 24 turbines that stand approximately 30 feet tall by 4 feet wide.He started a company, Scalable Wind Solutions, to commercialize the software used to optimally place the turbines. This has also led to the Navy funding development of an underwater craft that propels on these concepts which needs 30% less energy.\n",

      "Dr. Abhay V. Ashtekar, Professor of Physics at Penn State University, was born into a middle class family in the Indian state of Maharastra, where his family expected him to either become a doctor, engineer, or civil servant. Even during his undergraduate studies in India, Dr. Ashtekar was advised that it was impossible to make a living doing physics research. However, Dr. Ashtekar broke out of the career models that his family and culture prescribed him and came to the United States to study gravitational physics (Glanz, 1999). After completing his PhD at the University of Chicago, Dr. Ashtekar went on to develop the theory of quantum Riemannian geometry, which is used to examine the big bang of general relativity with less ambiguity (National Academy of Sciences). Dr. Chris Isham of Imperial College in London said of Dr. Ashtekar’s work that “it really rejuvenated the whole field and caused quite an explosion of activity” (Glanz, 1999).\n",

He discovered his passion for astronomy when visiting a planetarium as a child and later took classes at the Hayden planetarium which he is the director of today. Neil and several colleagues layed the foundation for Pluto being demoted from a planet to a dwarf planet and helped with the classification of many objects within our solar system as dwarf planets. Neil was inspired by Carl Sagan who signed a book for Neil when he was visiting his office, Carl hosted a show known as Carl Sagans Cosmos which helped inspire Neil further and Neil later in his life continued the legacy by making his own show Cosmos. The show became famous almost immediately, his efforts helped to educate the public on the history of astronomy as well as the wonders that we have discovered. Neil succeeded in a career of science that often did not see many African American scientists and inspires many people to follow his path in the career of astronomy today.\n",

      "Mayly Sanchez is a Venezuelan born physicist who researches neutrinos. Like neutrons neutrinos are neutral particles, meaning they are uncharged. Neutrinos are biproducts of nuclear decay and are also generated from nuclear reactions that take place in the stars like the sun. Sanchez studies these particles with the help of her Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE). The ANNIE is a water-based neutrino detector that weighs an astonishing 26-tons. The ANNIE is a cooperative effort between a bunch of physicists to create a neutrino detector combining both advanced photoreceptors and cutting-edge experimental approaches, that will further our knowledge of neutrino-nucleus interactions. According to Fermilab the ANNIE project should be fully functional by the end of 2018. Mayly Sanchez first started to be interested in physics from an astrological standpoint. When she was young she was interested in astrology, ultimately her uncle informed her that in order to properly understand astronomy she would need to learn physics and thus began her scientific career. Sanchez studied physics at the Universidad de Los Andes in Merida, Venezuela, earning her undergraduate degree in 1995. From there she went to Trieste Italy, for one year to earn a diploma in high energy physics. Following this she entered a doctoral program at Tufts University in Massachusetts, completing her PhD in 2003, her dissertation “Oscillation Analysis of Atmospheric Neutrinos in Soudan 2” highlighting her interest in fundamental particles, especially neutrinos. After completing her doctorate, she pursued four years of post-doctorate work at Harvard University furthering her work in neutrinos. In 2011 President Obama honored her for her contributions to the study of neutrinos as well as for her importance as a woman in STEM. Now Sanchez is a founder of the ANNIE project as well as working with the DEEP Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) hoping to further our knowledge of the fundamental particles of the universe.\n",

      "Shirley Ann Jackson is an African-American physicist born in Washington D.C., on August 5th, 1946. She was the first African-American women to get a PhD from MIT and only the second in the U.S. to earn a PhD in physics. She faced regular discrimination from classmates and faculty throughout her undergraduate years, but she remained at MIT for her graduate studies and spearheaded programs to recruit and support minority students at the Institute. Her interest in science began with biology; Jackson studied the circadian rhythm of bees captured from her garden at just 9 years old. After leaving MIT, Dr.Jackson studied hadrons as a research associate at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. She was also a visiting scientist at CERN in Switzerland where she worked on theories relating to elementary particles. She was a part of the Theoretical Physics Research Department at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1976 and studied materials used in the semiconductor industry. She also researched on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional and quasi-two dimensional systems. She made contributions to the knowledge of charged density waves in layered compounds and optical and electronic properties of semiconductor strained-layer superlattices. Since her postgraduate studies, she has been active in initiatives to increase African American participation in science and math. She has been serving as the president of Rensselear Polytechnic Institute since July 1, 1999. She was the first black woman to be elected to the National Academy of Engineering. She did most of her research on optical and electronic properties of layered materials, surface electrons of liquid helium films, strained-layer semiconductor superlattices, and most notably, the polaronic aspects of electrons in two- dimensional systems.\n",

Andrea decided to pursue her Bachelors degree in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and eventually earned her degree in 1987. Following this, Andrea earned her Ph.D. in 1992 at the California Institute of Technology. She also convinced her advisor to let her teach undergraduate courses in physics so that she would inspire young women to pursue science degrees. As a result, she received the Caltech teaching award which is an honor normally reserved for faculty members. During this time, Andrea discovered that most stars are formed in pairs and that most space systems have two suns.\n",

      "As of 1994, Andrea has been working with the UCLA Galactic Center Group. Andrea and her team have been able to use special telescopes and other special optics to look at the center of the milky way galaxy and observing how celestial bodies interact with invisible black holes around them. Currently, the long-held theory of general relativity is being challenged. The gravitational forces produced by black holes are massive compared to the forces by other planets and stars. In the future, Andrea and her team hope to solve this challenge.\n",

      "Bio: Mglerner’s page introducing Miranda Cheng: “Miranda Cheng is a mathematician and theoretical physicist at the University of Amsterdam. She works with the theoretical concept of Umbral Moonshine, which works with the presence of shadows in the theory of mock modular forms. Her background includes dropping out of high school in Taiwan to be part of a punk rock band at the age of 16 and then later entering a university as a part of a gifted program. She now works as an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam and does work connecting to K3 surfaces and string theory. She is able to pass on excitement and knowledge to students and expand the field of theoretical physics as is related to mathematics.”\n",
      "New fact: Miranda Cheng is trying to link umbral moonshines and K3 model together, and she believes that this will help people to understand “the physics of the real world where it can’t be probed directly — such as inside black holes”, according to Wolchover. Besides music, she was really into literature as a child, and she tried to study literature in college, but she started found “peace quiet beauty” in physics and math after a quantum mechanics class and got drawn into it since then (Cheng).\n",

      "A physicist that I chose to focus, due to her field of study, is woman named Lisa Randall. Born in America on June 18, 1962, she’s a theoretical physicist that worked on particle physics and cosmology. She received her B.A. in physics and a Phd. in theoretical particle physics at Harvard University. The primary focus of Randall’s research revolved around elementary particles, fundamental forces and extra dimensions of space. Some of her studies include the relative weakness of gravity and the Standard Model. Alongside Raman Sundrum in 1999, Lisa Randall contributed to the Randall-Sundrum model, which describes the world in terms of a warped geometry higher-dimensional universe. The model is a braneworld theory that was developed in trying to solve the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. It involved an extremely warped finite five-dimensional bulk with two branes called the Planckbrane (where gravity is a strong force) and the Tevbrane (containing the Standard Model particles). It’s because of Lisa’s theories that theoretical insights to our current understanding of our given properties and interactions of matter. It’s with this that she developed and studied a wide variety of models to address these questions.\n",

Born to a wealthy Parisi family that was insistent on him pursuing a career in mechanical engineering, Bhabha instead pursued a career in theoretical physics at Cambridge University, where he began to take an interest in nuclear physics (Homi Jehangir Bhabha). Upon returning to India, he became a founding director and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) (Homi J.). TIFR and AEET were the cornerstones of Indian development of nuclear weapons. Bhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha scattering (Homi J.). His major contribution included his work on Compton scattering, R-process, and furthermore the advancement of nuclear physics (Homi J.). In 1953, he was awarded Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award in India.\n",

      "Marie Curie, born Maria Salomea Sklodowski, was born on November 7th, 1867 in Warsaw, Poland (Bagley). Because the University of Warsaw did not accept women, she went to France to join her older sister. She attended the Universite de Sorbonne in Paris in 1891 where she studied physics and mathematics. She met her future husband in 1894 and was married a year later (Bagley). She won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel (Marie Curie). Henri Becquerel first discovered radiation from uranium in 1896 and inspired the Curies to further investigate the phenomenon (Marie Curie). They discovered that the ores pitchblende and chacolite were more radioactive than uranium (Bagley). Marie Curie believed that the ores contained unknown radioactive substances which led them to discover two new elements, polonium and radium, both more radioactive than uranium (Bagley). After her husband died in 1906, Marie Curie continued with her work and was awarded the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, making her the first woman to win one Nobel Prize and the first person to win two Nobel Prizes (Marie Curie).\n",

      "Many of us have by now heard of quarks. Quarks are subatomic particles that make up protons and neutrons and belong to the class of particles known as fermions. Apart from fermions, the other major class of subatomic particles is bosons. Photons are the most well-known example of bosons, and the recently-discovered Higgs boson (also called the \"God Particle\") is also a boson. Bosons were named in honour of Satyendra Nath Bose, an Indian scientist who conducted groundbreaking work in theoretical physics in the 20th century. Most of us hear much more often about Boses collaborator, Albert Einstein (Blanpied, 1972). But Boses work in the then-uncharted territories of quantum mechanics was critical in paving the way for several seminal theories in physics, such as the existence of the Bose-Einstein Condensate (another state of matter) and the Bose-Einstein Statistics (which determine the characteristics of a boson particle) (Leggett, 2009).\n",
      "Bose was born and raised in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, and spent much of his early career between Kolkata and Dhaka (present-day Bangladesh). He collaborated heavily with Albert Einstein for their work in quantum mechanics and was the author for several groundbreaking papers in theoretical physics . Bose received the Padma Vibhushan in 1954, thus earning one of the highest civilian honours bestowed by the Government of India post-independence (Mehra, 1975). While he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics by several leading Indian physicists, his work was not judged to be worthy of a Nobel Prize (Chatterjee & Chatterjee, 1976). Regardless, Boses contributions continue to impact physics as we discover more about subatomic particles, and having an entire class of particles named after Bose is an honour that continues to inspire Indian scientists today.\n",

Lisa graduated from Harvard University with a B.A. in physics and a Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics and is currently on the physics faculty at Harvard. Her research was based on elementary particles, fundamental forces and the extra dimensions of space. She works on a number of different sectors including the Standard Model, relative weakness of gravity, cosmological inflation and dark matter. Her research has played an essential role in filling the gaps in our current knowledge of matter and its corresponding interactions. Her most prominent and recognized work till date is on the extra dimensions of space. The field she concentrated on is quite diverse and makes up almost 96%  of what we do not see and do not know about the universe. She contributed to the Randall–Sundrum model published in 1999 alongside Randall–Sundrum. She remains one of the most significant theoretical physicists landing a place in Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2007. With an impressive list of credentials and multiple breakthroughs in the world of Physics, Lisa Randall’s body of work would fit perfectly in our current textbook, Matter & Interactions by Ruth W. Chabay, Bruce A. Sherwood, and will especially improve on the information provided in Chapter 3 (The Fundamental Interactions), Chapter 14 (Electrics Fields and Matter) and Chapter 21 (Patterns of Field in Space) which cover the same area as Lisa’s research. The inclusion of her work will make the concepts easier to grasp while providing more in-depth knowledge about the respective topics.\n",

As he continued to grow many thought he had speaking problems. It wasn’t until Mr.Pollack visited a “psychologist [that] recognized that [Pollack] thought so fast that his verbalization got in trouble trying to keep up!” Mr. Pollack grew up to later became valedictorian of his high school where he left to Princeton University graduating with “High Honors in Physics.”\n",
      "Fast forward a few years, Mr. Pollack attended Harvard University where he met Carl Sagan. Both men became great friends and would later work together on many projects. Mr. Pollack specifically brought about advancements in planetary modeling, more so in “determining the composition of Saturn’s rings and creating models of how gas giants form.” This allowed scientists to further expand our understanding of the universe. Mr. Pollack didn’t stop there though, he “developed the world’s most complete model of Mars’ atmospheric circulation.” This model was used to “interpret Viking spacecraft data and also helped in planning future missions to Mars by NASA as well as European and Russian space agencies.” For his insurmountable contributions to the science community, James B. Pollack received many awards. Most notable and prestigious was his “Gerard P. Kuiper Prize of the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society, “for excellent and enduring contributions to planetary science”.” It’s also noteworthy to say that apart from having his speaking problems, Mr. Pollack lived a same-sex life, but that’s never mentioned. It’s not enough to remember just his gifts, but also his loves in life and what made him happy and complete to get up everyday and continue his life’s work.\n",
