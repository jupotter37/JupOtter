      "Truth!!! tWitch is hands down the most awesome dancer of his caliber on the scene today.  Him and Fikshun are both awesome, but there is something about tWitch that is just.....more....a big guy like that who can do floor work like he can is just stellar.\n",

      "I still say he should've been the one to win that season. sucks that he hurt himself\n",
      "I agree, he would have had it in the bag.  He excelled at all the styles.  He ended up having to have 2 surgeries for 2 separate injuries.  Ballet can tear your body up.  There has been other ballet boys, but none of them have been the quality of Alex.\n",
      "NeonPhoenix Yeah.He definitely would have won! I remember so many people got injured that season.I don't know what was going on!\n",
      "+classeychicforever it seems to run in spurts like that.  I watch Dancing with the Stars also and it seems that they have seasons that people get hurt right and left also.  If I remember correction Misty May-Treanor had an injury that could have permanently ended her Olympic career - she had to quite the competition after she tore her Achilles tendon in Jive rehearsals. \n",
      "\n",
      "I remember after one really bad season the next season they made a ruling that they were only allowed to practice either 4 or 6 hours per day.  No way you can work on your routines in that amount of time - I've noticed that rule has gone out the door and hasn't been mentioned in several seasons.\n",

      "omg same!!\n",
      "There is only 3 dances that really stand out in my memory from all the seasons of SYTYCD as being THE BEST.  This is one of them - noteworthy when Ellen guest starred.  The hip hop routine with Fikshun and tWitch is a close 2nd and for group routine I will never forget Rama Lama Bang Bang from 9 years ago.  That group number was awesome.\n",
