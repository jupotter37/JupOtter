    "Located in the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca, Suriqui Island is well-known for its inhabitants being the last remaining community to extend the art of color boat construction. The inhabitants are in the immediate need of the water supply and treatment plant that could help them build the fresh-water drinking system in the Suriqui Island. There are four separate communities need water supplies. AguaClara is trying to apply its current water treatment technology to the local community, to offer the residents safe water at a sustainable and low cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "The water source being used by the water treatment plant is from Lake Titicaca, the largest freshwater lake in South America, straddles the border between Bolivia and Peru. Pollution from urban and agricultural development is a persistent problem in the lake. The proposed water treatment plant at Suriqui Island is a consequence of the emerging water contamination."

    "**Proposed Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed solution for constructing the water treatment plant is a single plant that provides water to the entire community. The plant is designed to be located at the highest elevation to have sufficient potential energy to deliver water to each community. The sample sketches could be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The elevation of the plant above the highest residence in the island is 10 meters. This elevation ensures enough head to deliver water from the water treatment plant to all the households on the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest elevation of residence is 3867m (12688 feet) above sea level. The water treatment plant is therefore at an elevation of 3877m (12721 ft) above sea level.   The determination of the location of the treatment plant has three criterias: 1) the plant needs to be away from sewage outflow to ensure the water is not directly exposed to contamination. 2) Buiding the plant on a slope could reduce the amount of excavation required by the plant, because the bottom of the OStaRS filters is several meters lower in elevation than the bottom of the flocculation/ sedimentation tanks. 3) The plant should not be far away from the shorline, which can minimize the length of the water intake pipes. Based on the three criterias, the plant is designed to be built on the northeast side of the island indicated on the graph map. Since the area is away from the most populated (southwest side) of the island, the quality of the water intake is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the small residence population on the island, the cost of installing water usage meters is relatively expensive (the average price is approximately equivalent to the plant construction cost, according to Professor Monroe Weber-shirk). The average water usage per capita in Bolivia is estimated to be 25-50 L/p/day. In this study, the water usage per person is 100 L/p/day due to the absence of metering.\n",

    "First off, for solar there are over 12 hours of sunlight per day on average this is advantageous because there is a lot of sun to be captured. In addition, the average temperature is relatively low which is factored into our spread sheet. The low temperature is advantageous because solar panels become less efficient with high temperatures. Moreover, the installed cost of solar has gone down significantly over the last thirty years. To put into perspective how much the price of solar has decreased in the last 35 years, in 1975 the average installed cost of solar per watt was 30 USD and in 2010 it was 1.50 USD (Vanek, 2017). This is a significant decrease, and it is helping create a strong argument for solar. This is interesting because the cost is significantly even considering the cost of the storage tank, which allows a constant inflow of 6L/s. \n",

    "Based our calculations for the solar energy, we introduce one alternative - the application for solar battery system. We subsitute the cost of constructing a storage tank with the cost of a battery system which stores energy and eliminates the need for storage. This would address unpredictable variability such as the cloudy or rainy weather. From our calculations below, we think this alternative is even better than the current solar plan. \n",

The main one being the cost of the diesel even though the Bolivian government has already subsidized part of the diesel price. In addition, the extent of diesel usage is also relevantly limited. Though the operation of diesel-based pumps is not related to the sunlight time nor the weather, which in fact is nice for the solar panels, we need to take the maintennance of the pump into consideration. \n",

Nowadays, the Bolivian government has a less strict policy in the domestic diesel use in Bolivia for its citizens, though such policy towards foreigners is still strict in terms of the daily usage and objectives. Another benefit for diesel is that there are lots of diesel-based water pumps in the market and we could get a lower total price potentially. Moreover, we don't need to store the water here and therefore there is no storage cost compared to solar energy since we can just directly pumping the water from the lake.\n",

    "We also did a second analysis where we compared the storage tank option to a battery system that stores electricity during the day so that the pump can meet the 6 L/s rating throughout the entire day. Introducing this battery system eliminates the need for a storage tank, because we can power the pump during the night with the stored energy from the day. \n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis comparing the solar system paired with a tank to the battery system option, we think that the battery option makes more sense because of many reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "1. Less expensive\n",
    "2. More sustainable\n",
    "3. Less construction\n",
    "4. Eliminates issue of variability\n",
    "5. Ability to expand and produce electricity for island\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "1. 10% energy loss from input of battery to usable energy\n",
    "2. Specialized operator education \n",
    "3. Possibly high installation cost in Bolivia"

    "\n",
    "Team Ssssnakes made a descriptive and numeric analysis on the centralized water treatment plant in Suriqui Island. We pick an appropriate location for the water input and calculate the desired elevation of the wtp. We then conduct cost-effective analysis for two energy-based pumps: diesel and solar energy. In short, our team believes the solar-based pumping system equipped with solar battery is the best option for Suriqui and the estimated cost is 61887 USD."

    "\n",
    "The future research analysts should study the economic and sociological cost of having multiple water treatment plants on the island, and compare that with the results of this study. The multiple plants design is assumed to have less distribution systems, but more operation and construction costs. In addition, the future teams could analyze the unit price of water and the associated logistics. A detailed plant design should be provided to the community. Finally if the solar system paired with batteries is chosen, it might be able to provide a starting place for also supplying electricity to the community. "
