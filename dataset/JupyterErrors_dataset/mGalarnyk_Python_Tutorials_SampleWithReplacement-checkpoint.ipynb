    "The reason why the sampling unit is returned to the population before the next sampling unit is drawn is to make sure the probability of selecting any particular sampling unit remains the same in future draws. There are many applications of sampling with replacement throughout data science. Many of these applications use bootstrapping which is a statistical procedure that uses sampling with replacement on a dataset to create many simulated samples. Datasets that are created with sampling with replacement so that they have the same number of samples as the original dataset are called bootstrapped datasets. Bootstrapped data is used in machine learning algorithms like [bagged trees](https://youtu.be/urb2wRxnGz4) and random forests as well as in statistical methods like [bootstrapped confidence intervals](https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculate-bootstrap-confidence-intervals-machine-learning-results-python/), and more.\n",

    "Imagine you have a jar of 12 unique glass beads like in the image above. If you are sampling with replacement from the jar, the chance of <b>randomly</b> selecting any 1 of the glass beads is 1/12. After selecting a bead, return it to the jar so that the probability of selecting any of the 12 beads in future sampling doesn't change (1/12). This means that if you repeat the process it is entirely possible you could randomly take out the same bead (1/12 chance in this case). \n",
