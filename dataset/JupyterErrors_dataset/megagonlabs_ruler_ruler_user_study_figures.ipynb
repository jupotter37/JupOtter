    "> We asked participants to write  labeling functions for two prevalent labeling tasks: spam detection and sentiment classification.  They performed these two tasks on  YouTube Comments and Amazon Reviews, respectively. Participants received 15 mins of instruction on how to use each tool, using a topic classification task (electronics vs. guns) over a newsgroup dataset~\\cite{rennie200820} as an example. We asked participants to write as many functions as they considered necessary for the goal of the task.  There were given 30 mins to complete each task and we recorded the labeling functions they created and these functions' individual and aggregate performances.  After completing both tasks, participants also filled out an exit survey, providing their qualitative feedback.\n",

    "> For the manual programming condition, we iteratively developed a Jupyter notebook interface based on the Snorkel tutorial. We provided a section for writing functions, a section with diverse analysis tools, and a section to train a logistic regression model on the labels they had generated (evaluated on the test set shown to the user, which is separate from our heldout test set used for the final evaluation).\n",
