        "This is an assignment covering the basics of Spiking Neural Networks. In SNNs, if a neuron’s value surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron will “Spike” and send a single impulse to each downstream neuron connected to the first one. SNNs are resource efficient alternatives to artificial neural networks: able to function with fewer neurons and usually being much faster. They are also dynamic and can train while working, providing an edge in dynamic tasks like speech identification. \n",
