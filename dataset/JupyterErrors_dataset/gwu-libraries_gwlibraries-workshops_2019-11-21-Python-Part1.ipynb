    "## What is Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a general purpose programming language that supports rapid development of data analytics applications. The word “Python” is used to refer to both, the programming language and the tool that executes the scripts written in Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its main advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Free\n",
    "* Open-source\n",
    "* Available on all major platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n",
    "* Supported by Python Software Foundation, has large community\n",
    "* Supports multiple programming paradigms: data analysis, application development, machine learning\n",
    "* Rich ecosystem of third-party packages\n",
    "\n",
    "So, why use Python for data analysis?\n",
    "* As a language, accessible for new members of the community to get up to speed.\n",
    "* Supports reproducibility: Reproducibility is the ability to obtain the same results using the same dataset(s) and analysis.\n",
    "** Data analysis written as a Python script can be reproduced on any platform. Moreover, if you collect more or correct existing data, you can quickly and easily re-run your analysis! An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be reproducible, so knowing Python will give you an edge with these requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatility: Python can read text files, connect to databases, and many other data formats, on your computer or on the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interdisciplinary and extensible: Python provides a framework that allows anyone to combine approaches from different research (but not only) disciplines to best suit your analysis needs.\n"

    "Anaconda distribution of Python includes a lot of its popular packages, such as the IPython console, Jupyter Notebook, and Spyder IDE. Have a quick look around the Anaconda Navigator. You can launch programs from the Navigator or use the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that allow one to easilty create documents that combine code, graphs, and narrative text. Spyder is an Integrated Development Environment that allows one to write Python scripts and interact with the Python software from within a single interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda also comes with a package manager called conda, which makes it easy to install and update additional packages from the command line. \n",

    "## Opening up a notebook:\n",
    "1. Click on the Launch button under Jupyter Notebook (not Jupyter Lab). \n",
